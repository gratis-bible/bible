or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken unto me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not shew you favour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But, The LORD liveth, that brought up the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave unto their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and after will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For mine eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from mine eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled mine inheritance with the carcases of their detestable and abominable things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O LORD, my strength, and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come unto thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things wherein there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make gods unto himself, and they are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, behold, I will this once cause them to know, I will cause them to know mine hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is The LORD.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
