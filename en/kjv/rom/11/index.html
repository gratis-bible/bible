God forbid. For I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>God hath not cast away his people which he foreknew. Wot ye not what the scripture saith of Elias? how he maketh intercession to God against Israel, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they seek my life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But what saith the answer of God unto him? I have reserved to myself seven thousand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of Baal.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Even so then at this present time also there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And if by grace, then is it no more of works: otherwise grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then is it no more grace: otherwise work is no more work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>What then? Israel hath not obtained that which he seeketh for; but the election hath obtained it, and the rest were blinded</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>According as it is written, God hath given them the spirit of slumber, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear;) unto this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And David saith, Let their table be made a snare, and a trap, and a stumblingblock, and a recompence unto them:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Let their eyes be darkened, that they may not see, and bow down their back alway.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>I say then, Have they stumbled that they should fall? God forbid: but rather through their fall salvation is come unto the Gentiles, for to provoke them to jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now if the fall of them be the riches of the world, and the diminishing of them the riches of the Gentiles; how much more their fulness?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For I speak to you Gentiles, inasmuch as I am the apostle of the Gentiles, I magnify mine office:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>If by any means I may provoke to emulation them which are my flesh, and might save some of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For if the casting away of them be the reconciling of the world, what shall the receiving of them be, but life from the dead?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For if the firstfruit be holy, the lump is also holy: and if the root be holy, so are the branches.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And if some of the branches be broken off, and thou, being a wild olive tree, wert graffed in among them, and with them partakest of the root and fatness of the olive tree;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Boast not against the branches. But if thou boast, thou bearest not the root, but the root thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Thou wilt say then, The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Well; because of unbelief they were broken off, and thou standest by faith. Be not highminded, but fear:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For if God spared not the natural branches, take heed lest he also spare not thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Behold therefore the goodness and severity of God: on them which fell, severity; but toward thee, goodness, if thou continue in his goodness: otherwise thou also shalt be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they also, if they abide not still in unbelief, shall be graffed in: for God is able to graff them in again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For if thou wert cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and wert graffed contrary to nature into a good olive tree: how much more shall these, which be the natural branches, be graffed into their own olive tree?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And so all Israel shall be saved: as it is written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For this is my covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>As concerning the gospel, they are enemies for your sakes: but as touching the election, they are beloved for the fathers' sakes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For as ye in times past have not believed God, yet have now obtained mercy through their unbelief:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Even so have these also now not believed, that through your mercy they also may obtain mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For God hath concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>O the depth of the riches both of the wisdom and knowledge of God! how unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his counsellor?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Or who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed unto him again?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
