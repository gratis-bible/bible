        <description>In 1604, King James I of England authorized that a new translation of the Bible into English be started. It was finished in 1611, just 85 years after the first translation of the New Testament into English appeared (Tyndale, 1526). The Authorized Version, or King James Version, quickly became the standard for English-speaking Protestants. Its flowing language and prose rhythm has had a profound influence on the literature of the past 300 years.</description>

        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard have I not kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the shepherds' tents.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.2.14'>O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is comely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.15'>Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for our vines have tender grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.16'>My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.2.17'>Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the mountains of Bether.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.3.3'>The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said, Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.4'>It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go, until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the chamber of her that conceived me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.3.5'>I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.4'>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.1'>Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.2'>Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.3'>Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.4'>Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.4.8'>Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon: look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon, from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.4.9'>Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of thy neck.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.5'>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.1'>I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.2'>I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my locks with the drops of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.3'>I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed my feet; how shall I defile them?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.7'>The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me, they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil from me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.5.14'>His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.5.15'>His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.6.9'>My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the concubines, and they praised her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.10'>Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.11'>I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the valley, and to see whether the vine flourished, and the pomegranates budded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.12'>Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of Amminadib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.6.13'>Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the company of two armies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.2'>Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor: thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.3'>Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.4'>Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.7'>This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.8'>I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.9'>And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved, that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are asleep to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.10'>I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.7.11'>Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.7.13'>The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O my beloved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Song.8'>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.1'>O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.2'>I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine of the juice of my pomegranate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Song.8.7'>Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly be contemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.8.8'>We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?</verse>
