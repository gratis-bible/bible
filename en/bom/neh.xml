        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is God’s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, during a special conference of elders of the Church, held at Hiram, Ohio, November 1, 1831. HC 1: 221-224. Many revelations had been received from the Lord prior to this time, and the compilation of these for publication in book form was one of the principal subjects passed upon at the conference. This section constitutes the Lord's Preface to the doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation.] HEARKEN, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And the rebellious shall be pierced with much sorrow; for their iniquities shall be spoken upon the housetops, and their secret acts shall be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And the voice of warning shall be unto all people, by the mouths of my disciples, whom I have chosen in these last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>And they shall go forth and none shall stay them, for I the Lord have commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Behold, this is mine authority, and the authority of my servants, and my preface unto the book of my commandments, which I have given them to publish unto you, O inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>Wherefore, fear and tremble, O ye people, for what I the Lord have decreed in them shall be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>And verily I say unto you, that they who go forth, bearing these tidings unto the inhabitants of the earth, to them is power given to seal both on earth and in heaven, the unbelieving and rebellious;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>Yea, verily, to seal them up unto the day when the wrath of God shall be poured out upon the wicked without measure-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>Unto the day when the Lord shall come to recompense unto every man according to his work, and measure to every man according to the measure which he has measured to his fellow man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>Wherefore the voice of the Lord is unto the ends of the earth, that all that will hear may hear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.12'>Prepare ye, prepare ye for that which is to come, for the Lord is nigh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.13'>And the anger of the Lord is kindled, and his sword is bathed in heaven, and it shall fall upon the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.14'>And the arm of the Lord shall be revealed; and the day cometh that they who will not hear the voice of the Lord, neither the voice of his servants, neither give heed to the words of the prophets and apostles, shall be cut off from among the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.15'>For they have strayed from mine ordinances, and have broken mine everlasting covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.16'>They seek not the Lord to establish his righteousness, but every man walketh in his own way, and after the image of his own god, whose image is in the likeness of the world, and whose substance is that of an idol, which waxeth old and shall perish in Babylon, even Babylon the great, which shall fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.17'>Wherefore, I the Lord, knowing the calamity which should come upon the inhabitants of the earth, called upon my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and spake unto him from heaven, and gave him commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.18'>And also gave commandments to others, that they should proclaim these things unto the world; and all this that it might be fulfilled, which was written by the prophets-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.19'>The weak things of the world shall come forth and break down the mighty and strong ones, that man should not counsel his fellow man, neither trust in the arm of flesh-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.20'>But that every man might speak in the name of God the Lord, even the Savior of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.21'>That faith also might increase in the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.22'>That mine everlasting covenant might be established;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.23'>That the fulness of my gospel might be proclaimed by the weak and the simple unto the ends of the world, and before kings and rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.24'>Behold, I am God and have spoken it; these commandments are of me, and were given unto my servants in their weakness, after the manner of their language, that they might come to understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.25'>And inasmuch as they erred it might be made known;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.26'>And inasmuch as they sought wisdom they might be instructed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.27'>And inasmuch as they sinned they might be chastened, that they might repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.28'>And inasmuch as they were humble they might be made strong, and blessed from on high, and receive knowledge from time to time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.29'>And after having received the record of the Nephites, yea, even my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., might have power to translate through the mercy of God, by the power of God, the Book of Mormon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.30'>And also those to whom these commandments were given, might have power to lay the foundation of this church, and to bring it forth out of obscurity and out of darkness, the only true and living church upon the face of the whole earth, with which I, the Lord, am well pleased, speaking unto the church collectively and not individually-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.31'>For I the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.32'>Nevertheless, he that repents and does the commandments of the Lord shall be forgiven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.33'>And he that repents not, from him shall be taken even the light which he has received; for my Spirit shall not always strive with man, saith the Lord of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.34'>And again, verily I say unto you, O inhabitants of the earth: I the Lord am willing to make these things known unto all flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.35'>For I am no respecter of persons, and will that all men shall know that the day speedily cometh; the hour is not yet, but is nigh at hand, when peace shall be taken from the earth, and the devil shall have power over his own dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.36'>And also the Lord shall have power over his saints, and shall reign in their midst, and shall come down in judgment upon Idumea, or the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.37'>Search these commandments, for they are true and faithful, and the prophecies and promises which are in them shall all be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.38'>What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself; and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.39'>For behold, and lo, the Lord is God, and the Spirit beareth record, and the record is true, and the truth abideth forever and ever. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>[An extract from the words of the angel Moroni to Joseph Smith the Prophet, while in the house of the Prophet's father at Manchester, New York, on the evening of September 21, 1823. HC 1: 12. Moroni was the last of a long line of historians who had made the record that is now before the world as the Book of Mormon. Compare Malachi 4: 5-6; also Sections 27: 9; 110: 13-16; and 128: 18.] BEHOLD, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>[Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, July 1828, relating to the loss of 116 pages of manuscript translated from the first part of the Book of Mormon, which was called the "Book of Lehi." The Prophet had reluctantly allowed these pages to pass from his custody to that of Martin Harris, who had served for a brief period as scribe in the translation of the Book of Mormon. The revelation was given through the Urim and Thummim. HC 1: 21-23. See also Section 10.] THE works, and the designs, and the purposes of God cannot be frustrated, neither can they come to naught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>For God doth not walk in crooked paths, neither doth he turn to the right hand nor to the left, neither doth he vary from that which he hath said, therefore his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.3'>Remember, remember that it is not the work of God that is frustrated, but the work of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.4'>For although a man may have many revelations, and have power to do many mighty works, yet if he boasts in his own strength, and sets at naught the counsels of God, and follows after the dictates of his own will and carnal desires, he must fall and incur the vengeance of a just God upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.5'>Behold, you have been entrusted with these things, but how strict were your commandments; and remember also the promises which were made to you, if you did not transgress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.6'>And behold, how oft you have transgressed the commandments and the laws of God, and have gone on in the persuasions of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.7'>For, behold, you should not have feared man more than God. Although men set at naught the counsels of God, and despise his words-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.8'>Yet you should have been faithful; and he would have extended his arm and supported you against all the fiery darts of the adversary; and he would have been with you in every time of trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.9'>Behold, thou art Joseph, and thou wast chosen to do the work of the Lord, but because of transgression, if thou art not aware thou wilt fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.10'>But remember, God is merciful; therefore, repent of that which thou hast done which is contrary to the commandment which I gave you, and thou art still chosen, and art again called to the work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.11'>Except thou do this, thou shalt be delivered up and become as other men, and have no more gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.12'>And when thou deliveredst up that which God had given thee sight and power to translate, thou deliveredst up that which was sacred into the hands of a wicked man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.13'>Who has set at naught the counsels of God, and has broken the most sacred promises which were made before God, and has depended upon his own judgment and boasted in his own wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.14'>And this is the reason that thou hast lost thy privileges for a season-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.15'>For thou hast suffered the counsel of thy director to be trampled upon from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.16'>Nevertheless, my work shall go forth, for inasmuch as the knowledge of a Savior has come unto the world, through the testimony of the Jews, even so shall the knowledge of a Savior come unto my people-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.17'>And to the Nephites, and the Jacobites, and the Josephites, and the Zoramites, through the testimony of their fathers-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.18'>And this testimony shall come to the knowledge of the Lamanites, and the Lemuelites, and the Ishmaelites, who dwindled in unbelief because of the iniquity of their fathers, whom the Lord has suffered to destroy their brethren the Nephites, because of their iniquities and their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.19'>And for this very purpose are these plates preserved, which contain these records-that the promises of the Lord might be fulfilled, which he made to his people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.20'>And that the Lamanites might come to the knowledge of their fathers, and that they might know the promises of the Lord, and that they may believe the gospel and rely upon the merits of Jesus Christ, and be glorified through faith in his name, and that through their repentance they might be saved. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to his father, Joseph Smith, Sen., at Harmony, Pennsylvania, February 1829. HC 1: 28.] NOW behold, a marvelous work is about to come forth among the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>Therefore, O ye that embark in the service of God, see that ye serve him with all your heart, might, mind and strength, that ye may stand blameless before God at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Therefore, if ye have desires to serve God ye are called to the work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>For behold the field is white already to harvest; and lo, he that thrusteth in his sickle with his might, the same layeth up in store that he perisheth not, but bringeth salvation to his soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>And faith, hope, charity and love, with an eye single to the glory of God, qualify him for the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>Remember faith, virtue, knowledge, temperance, patience, brotherly kindness, godliness, charity, humility, diligence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>Ask, and ye shall receive; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, March 1829, at the request of Martin Harris. HC 1: 28-31.] BEHOLD, I say unto you, that as my servant Martin Harris has desired a witness at my hand, that you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., have got the plates of which you have testified and borne record that you have received of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>And now, behold, this shall you say unto him-he who spake unto you, said unto you: I, the Lord, am God, and have given these things unto you, my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and have commanded you that you should stand as a witness of these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>And I have caused you that you should enter into a covenant with me, that you should not show them except to those persons to whom I commanded you; and you have no power over them except I grant it unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>And you have a gift to translate the plates; and this is the first gift that I bestowed upon you; and I have commanded that you should pretend to no other gift until my purpose is fulfilled in this; for I will grant unto you no other gift until it is finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Verily, I say unto you, that woe shall come unto the inhabitants of the earth if they will not hearken unto my words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>For hereafter you shall be ordained and go forth and deliver my words unto the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Behold, if they will not believe my words, they would not believe you, my servant Joseph, if it were possible that you should show them all these things which I have committed unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>Oh, this unbelieving and stiffnecked generation-mine anger is kindled against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Behold, verily I say unto you, I have reserved those things which I have entrusted unto you, my servant Joseph, for a wise purpose in me, and it shall be made known unto future generations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>But this generation shall have my word through you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>And in addition to your testimony, the testimony of three of my servants, whom I shall call and ordain, unto whom I will show these things, and they shall go forth with my words that are given through you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Yea, they shall know of a surety that these things are true, for from heaven will I declare it unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>I will give them power that they may behold and view these things as they are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>And to none else will I grant this power, to receive this same testimony among this generation, in this the beginning of the rising up and the coming forth of my church out of the wilderness-clear as the moon, and fair as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>And the testimony of three witnesses will I send forth of my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>And behold, whosoever believeth on my words, them will I visit with the manifestation of my Spirit; and they shall be born of me, even of water and of the Spirit-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>And you must wait yet a little while, for ye are not yet ordained-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>And their testimony shall also go forth unto the condemnation of this generation if they harden their hearts against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>For a desolating scourge shall go forth among the inhabitants of the earth, and shall continue to be poured out from time to time, if they repent not, until the earth is empty, and the inhabitants thereof are consumed away and utterly destroyed by the brightness of my coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.20'>Behold, I tell you these things, even as I also told the people of the destruction of Jerusalem; and my word shall be verified at this time as it hath hitherto been verified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.21'>And now I command you, my servant Joseph, to repent and walk more uprightly before me, and to yield to the persuasions of men no more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.22'>And that you be firm in keeping the commandments wherewith I have commanded you; and if you do this, behold I grant unto you eternal life, even if you should be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.23'>And now, again, I speak unto you, my servant Joseph, concerning the man that desires the witness-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.24'>Behold, I say unto him, he exalts himself and does not humble himself sufficiently before me; but if he will bow down before me, and humble himself in mighty prayer and faith, in the sincerity of his heart, then will I grant unto him a view of the things which he desires to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.25'>And then he shall say unto the people of this generation: Behold, I have seen the things which the Lord hath shown unto Joseph Smith, Jun., and I know of a surety that they are true, for I have seen them, for they have been shown unto me by the power of God and not of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.26'>And I the Lord command him, my servant Martin Harris, that he shall say no more unto them concerning these things, except he shall say: I have seen them, and they have been shown unto me by the power of God; and these are the words which he shall say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.27'>But if he deny this he will break the covenant which he has before covenanted with me, and behold, he is condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.28'>And now, except he humble himself and acknowledge unto me the things that he has done which are wrong, and covenant with me that he will keep my commandments, and exercise faith in me, behold, I say unto him, he shall have no such views, for I will grant unto him no views of the things of which I have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.29'>And if this be the case, I command you, my servant Joseph, that you shall say unto him, that he shall do no more, nor trouble me any more concerning this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.30'>And if this be the case, behold, I say unto thee Joseph, when thou hast translated a few more pages thou shalt stop for a season, even until I command thee again; then thou mayest translate again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.31'>And except thou do this, behold, thou shalt have no more gift, and I will take away the things which I have entrusted with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.32'>And now, because I foresee the lying in wait to destroy thee, yea, I foresee that if my servant Martin Harris humbleth not himself and receive a witness from my hand, that he will fall into transgression;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.33'>And there are many that lie in wait to destroy thee from off the face of the earth; and for this cause, that thy days may be prolonged, I have given unto thee these commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.34'>Yea, for this cause I have said: Stop, and stand still until I command thee, and I will provide means whereby thou mayest accomplish the thing which I have commanded thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.35'>And if thou art faithful in keeping my commandments, thou shalt be lifted up at the last day. Amen.</verse>

Herein the Lord informs Joseph of alterations made by wicked men in the 116 manuscript pages from the translation of the "Book of Lehi," in the Book of Mormon. These manuscript pages had been lost from the possession of Martin Harris, to whom the sheets had been temporarily entrusted. See heading to Section 3. The evil design was to await the expected retranslation of the matter covered by the stolen pages, and then to discredit the translator by showing discrepancies created by the alterations. That this wicked purpose had been conceived by the evil one, and was known to the Lord even while Mormon, the ancient Nephite historian, was making his abridgment of the accumulated plates, is shown in the Book of Mormon (The Words of Mormon 1: 3-7).] NOW, behold, I say unto you, that because you delivered up those writings which you had power given unto you to translate by the means of the Urim and Thummim, into the hands of a wicked man, you have lost them.</verse>

At this time some members of the Church were disturbed by people making false claims as revelators. The Prophet inquired of the Lord and received this communication addressed to the elders of the Church. The first part deals with matters of Church polity; the latter part contains a warning that the elders are to give to the nations of the earth.] O HEARKEN, ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall speak unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.2'>For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations from my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.3'>And this ye shall know assuredly-that there is none other appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.43.8'>And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.9'>And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me-</verse>

In this early time of the Church, there had not yet developed a unified pattern for the conducting of Church services. However, a custom of admitting only members and earnest investigators to the sacrament meetings and other assemblies of the Church had become somewhat general.

(Some historical sources give the date of this revelation as May 1831.) Leman Copley had embraced the gospel, but still held to some of the teachings of the Shakers (United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing) to which he had formerly belonged. Some of the beliefs of the Shakers were that Christ's second coming had already occurred and he had appeared in the form of a woman, Ann Lee; baptism by water was not considered essential; the eating of pork was specifically forbidden, and many did not eat any meat; and a celibate life was considered higher than marriage. In prefacing this revelation, the Prophet wrote, "In order to have a more perfect understanding on the subject, I inquired of the Lord, and received the following." The revelation refuted some of the basic concepts of the Shaker group. The aforementioned brethren took a copy of the revelation to the Shaker community (near Cleveland, Ohio) and read it to them in its entirety, but it was rejected.] HEARKEN unto my word, my servants Sidney, and Parley, and Leman; for behold, verily I say unto you, that I give unto you a commandment that you shall go and preach my gospel which ye have received, even as ye have received it, unto the Shakers.</verse>

Elder Thayre was not ready to depart on his journey because of his involvement in the problems at Thompson, Ohio. See heading to Section 54.

In compliance with the Lord's command (Section 52), the elders had journeyed from Kirtland to Missouri with many varied experiences and some opposition. In contemplating the state of the Lamanites and the lack of civilization, refinement, and religion among the people generally, the Prophet exclaimed in yearning prayer: "When will the wilderness blossom as the rose? When will Zion be built up in her glory, and where will thy Temple stand, unto which all nations shall come in the last days?" Subsequently he received this revelation.] HEARKEN, O ye elders of my church, saith the Lord your God, who have assembled yourselves together, according to my commandments, in this land, which is the land of Missouri, which is the land which I have appointed and consecrated for the gathering of the saints.</verse>

Prefacing his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote: "In these infant days of the Church, there was a great anxiety to obtain the word of the Lord upon every subject that in any way concerned our salvation; and as the land of Zion was now the most important temporal object in view, I inquired of the Lord for further information upon the gathering of the Saints, and the purchase of the land, and other matters."] HEARKEN, O ye people, and open your hearts and give ear from afar; and listen, you that call yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear the word of the Lord and his will concerning you.</verse>

A company of brethren who had been commanded to journey to Zion (Missouri) was earnestly engaged in making preparations to leave in October. At this busy time, the revelation was received.] BEHOLD, thus saith the Lord your God unto you, O ye elders of my church, hearken ye and hear, and receive my will concerning you.</verse>

It was decided that Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer should take the manuscripts of the revelations to Independence, where W. W. Phelps would publish them as the "Book of Commandments." Many of the brethren bore solemn testimony that the revelations then compiled for publication were verily true, as was witnessed by the Holy Ghost shed forth upon them. The Prophet records that after the revelation known as Section 1 had been received, some negative conversation was had concerning the language used in the revelations.

On November 3, the revelation herein appearing as Section 133 was added, and called the Appendix. By action of the conference, Oliver Cowdery was appointed to carry the manuscript of the compiled revelations and commandments to Independence, Missouri, for printing. He was also to take with him moneys that had been contributed for the building up of the Church in Missouri. As the course of travel would lead him through a sparsely settled country to the frontier, a traveling companion was desirable.] HEARKEN unto me, saith the Lord your God, for my servant Oliver Cowdery's sake. It is not wisdom in me that he should be entrusted with the commandments and the moneys which he shall carry unto the land of Zion, except one go with him who will be true and faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.69.2'>Wherefore, I, the Lord, will that my servant, John Whitmer, should go with my servant Oliver Cowdery;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.69.7'>Nevertheless, let my servant John Whitmer travel many times from place to place, and from church to church, that he may the more easily obtain knowledge-</verse>

In the last of these assemblies the great importance of the Book of Commandments, later called the Doctrine and Covenants, was considered; and the Prophet refers to it as being "the foundation of the Church in these last days, and a benefit to the world, showing that the keys of the mysteries of the kingdom of our Savior are again entrusted to man."] BEHOLD, and hearken, O ye inhabitants of Zion, and all ye people of my church who are afar off, and hear the word of the Lord which I give unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and also unto my servant Martin Harris, and also unto my servant Oliver Cowdery, and also unto my servant John Whitmer, and also unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, and also unto my servant William W.

From sundry revelations which had been received, it was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of man had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled. It appeared self-evident from what truths were left, that if God rewarded every one according to the deeds done in the body, the term 'Heaven,' as intended for the Saints' eternal home, must include more kingdoms than one. Accordingly, while translating St. John's Gospel, myself and Elder Rigdon saw the following vision." It was after the Prophet had translated John 5: 29 that this vision was given.] HEAR, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.76.12'>By the power of the Spirit our eyes were opened and our understandings were enlightened, so as to see and understand the things of God-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.76.15'>For while we were doing the work of translation, which the Lord had appointed unto us, we came to the twenty-ninth verse of the fifth chapter of John, which was given unto us as follows-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.76.16'>Speaking of the resurrection of the dead, concerning those who shall hear the voice of the Son of Man:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.76.21'>And saw the holy angels, and them who are sanctified before his throne, worshiping God, and the Lamb, who worship him forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.76.22'>And now, after the many testimonies which have been given of him, this is the testimony, last of all, which we give of him: That he lives!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.76.23'>For we saw him, even on the right hand of God; and we heard the voice bearing record that he is the Only Begotten of the Father-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.76.24'>That by him, and through him, and of him, the worlds are and were created, and the inhabitants thereof are begotten sons and daughters unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.76.25'>And this we saw also, and bear record, that an angel of God who was in authority in the presence of God, who rebelled against the Only Begotten Son whom the Father loved and who was in the bosom of the Father, was thrust down from the presence of God and the Son,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.77.1'>[Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March 1832. HC 1: 253-255. The Prophet wrote, "In connection with the translation of the Scriptures, I received the following explanation of the Revelation of St. John."] Q. What is the sea of glass spoken of by John, 4th chapter, and 6th verse of the Revelation? A. It is the earth, in its sanctified, immortal, and eternal state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.2'>Q. What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse? A. They are figurative expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing heaven, the paradise of God, the happiness of man, and of beasts, and of creeping things, and of the fowls of the air; that which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other creature which God has created.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.3'>Q. Are the four beasts limited to individual beasts, or do they represent classes or orders? A. They are limited to four individual beasts, which were shown to John, to represent the glory of the classes of beings in their destined order or sphere of creation, in the enjoyment of their eternal felicity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.4'>Q. What are we to understand by the eyes and wings, which the beasts had? A. Their eyes are a representation of light and knowledge, that is, they are full of knowledge; and their wings are a representation of power, to move, to act, etc.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.5'>Q. What are we to understand by the four and twenty elders, spoken of by John? A. We are to understand that these elders whom John saw, were elders who had been faithful in the work of the ministry and were dead; who belonged to the seven churches, and were then in the paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.6'>Q. What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals? A. We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.7'>Q. What are we to understand by the seven seals with which it was sealed? A. We are to understand that the first seal contains the things of the first thousand years, and the second also of the second thousand years, and so on until the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.8'>Q. What are we to understand by the four angels, spoken of in the 7th chapter and 1st verse of Revelation? A. We are to understand that they are four angels sent forth from God, to whom is given power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and to destroy; these are they who have the everlasting gospel to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to shut up the heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the regions of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.9'>Q. What are we to understand by the angel ascending from the east, Revelation 7th chapter and 2nd verse? A. We are to understand that the angel ascending from the east is he to whom is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore, he crieth unto the four angels having the everlasting gospel, saying: Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And, if you will receive it, this is Elias which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and restore all things.</verse>

We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.12'>Q. What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned in the 8th chapter of Revelation? A. We are to understand that as God made the world in six days, and on the seventh day he finished his work, and sanctified it, and also formed man out of the dust of the earth, even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will the Lord God sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and judge all things, and shall redeem all things, except that which he hath not put into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels are the preparing and finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years-the preparing of the way before the time of his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.13'>Q. When are the things to be accomplished, which are written in the 9th chapter of Revelation? A. They are to be accomplished after the opening of the seventh seal, before the coming of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.14'>Q. What are we to understand by the little book which was eaten by John, as mentioned in the 10th chapter of Revelation? A.

        <verse osisID='Neh.77.15'>Q. What is to be understood by the two witnesses, in the eleventh chapter of Revelation? A. They are two prophets that are to be raised up to the Jewish nation in the last days, at the time of the restoration, and to prophesy to the Jews after they are gathered and have built the city of Jerusalem in the land of their fathers.</verse>

The order given of the Lord to Joseph Smith for the purpose of establishing a storehouse for the poor. HC 1: 255-257.

Williams is called to be a high priest and a counselor in the Presidency of the High Priesthood. The historical records show that when this revelation was received in March 1832, it called Jesse Gause to the office of counselor to Joseph Smith in the Presidency. However, when he failed to continue in a manner consistent with this appointment, the call was subsequently transferred to Frederick G. Williams. The revelation (dated March 1832) should be regarded as a step toward the formal organization of the First Presidency, specifically calling for the office of counselor in that body and explaining the dignity of the appointment. Brother Gause served for a time, but was excommunicated from the Church in December 1832. Brother Williams was ordained to the specified office on March 18, 1833.] VERILY, verily, I say unto you my servant Frederick G.

        <verse osisID='Neh.88.33'>For what doth it profit a man if a gift is bestowed upon him, and he receive not the gift? Behold, he rejoices not in that which is given unto him, neither rejoices in him who is the giver of the gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.34'>And again, verily I say unto you, that which is governed by law is also preserved by law and perfected and sanctified by the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.35'>That which breaketh a law, and abideth not by law, but seeketh to become a law unto itself, and willeth to abide in sin, and altogether abideth in sin, cannot be sanctified by law, neither by mercy, justice, nor judgment. Therefore, they must remain filthy still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.36'>All kingdoms have a law given;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.37'>And there are many kingdoms; for there is no space in the which there is no kingdom; and there is no kingdom in which there is no space, either a greater or a lesser kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.38'>And unto every kingdom is given a law; and unto every law there are certain bounds also and conditions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.39'>All beings who abide not in those conditions are not justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.40'>For intelligence cleaveth unto intelligence; wisdom receiveth wisdom; truth embraceth truth; virtue loveth virtue; light cleaveth unto light; mercy hath compassion on mercy and claimeth her own; justice continueth its course and claimeth its own; judgment goeth before the face of him who sitteth upon the throne and governeth and executeth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.41'>He comprehendeth all things, and all things are before him, and all things are round about him; and he is above all things, and in all things, and is through all things, and is round about all things; and all things are by him, and of him, even God, forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.42'>And again, verily I say unto you, he hath given a law unto all things, by which they move in their times and their seasons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.43'>And their courses are fixed, even the courses of the heavens and the earth, which comprehend the earth and all the planets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.44'>And they give light to each other in their times and in their seasons, in their minutes, in their hours, in their days, in their weeks, in their months, in their years-all these are one year with God, but not with man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.45'>The earth rolls upon her wings, and the sun giveth his light by day, and the moon giveth her light by night, and the stars also give their light, as they roll upon their wings in their glory, in the midst of the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.46'>Unto what shall I liken these kingdoms, that ye may understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.47'>Behold, all these are kingdoms, and any man who hath seen any or the least of these hath seen God moving in his majesty and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.48'>I say unto you, he hath seen him; nevertheless, he who came unto his own was not comprehended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.49'>The light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not; nevertheless, the day shall come when you shall comprehend even God, being quickened in him and by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.50'>Then shall ye know that ye have seen me, that I am, and that I am the true light that is in you, and that you are in me; otherwise ye could not abound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.51'>Behold, I will liken these kingdoms unto a man having a field, and he sent forth his servants into the field to dig in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.52'>And he said unto the first: Go ye and labor in the field, and in the first hour I will come unto you, and ye shall behold the joy of my countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.53'>And he said unto the second: Go ye also into the field, and in the second hour I will visit you with the joy of my countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.54'>And also unto the third, saying: I will visit you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.55'>And unto the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.56'>And the lord of the field went unto the first in the first hour, and tarried with him all that hour, and he was made glad with the light of the countenance of his lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.57'>And then he withdrew from the first that he might visit the second also, and the third, and the fourth, and so on unto the twelfth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.58'>And thus they all received the light of the countenance of their lord, every man in his hour, and in his time, and in his season-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.59'>Beginning at the first, and so on unto the last, and from the last unto the first, and from the first unto the last;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.60'>Every man in his own order, until his hour was finished, even according as his lord had commanded him, that his lord might be glorified in him, and he in his lord, that they all might be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.61'>Therefore, unto this parable I will liken all these kingdoms, and the inhabitants thereof-every kingdom in its hour, and in its time, and in its season, even according to the decree which God hath made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.62'>And again, verily I say unto you, my friends, I leave these sayings with you to ponder in your hearts, with this commandment which I give unto you, that ye shall call upon me while I am near-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.88.65'>And if ye ask anything that is not expedient for you, it shall turn unto your condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.66'>Behold, that which you hear is as the voice of one crying in the wilderness-in the wilderness, because you cannot see him-my voice, because my voice is Spirit; my Spirit is truth; truth abideth and hath no end; and if it be in you it shall abound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.88.67'>And if your eye be single to my glory, your whole bodies shall be filled with light, and there shall be no darkness in you; and that body which is filled with light comprehendeth all things.</verse>

As a consequence of the early brethren using tobacco in their meetings, the Prophet was led to ponder upon the matter; consequently he inquired of the Lord concerning it. This revelation, known as the Word of Wisdom, was the result.

Since the conference could not agree who should take charge of the farm, all agreed to inquire of the Lord concerning the matter.] BEHOLD, I say unto you, here is wisdom, whereby ye may know how to act concerning this matter, for it is expedient in me that this stake that I have set for the strength of Zion should be made strong.</verse>

This revelation came in consequence of the persecution upon the saints in Missouri. It is natural that the saints in Missouri, having suffered physically and also having lost property, should feel an inclination toward retaliation and revenge. Therefore the Lord gave this revelation. Although some news of the problems in Missouri had no doubt reached the Prophet in Kirtland (nine hundred miles away), the seriousness of the situation could have been known to him at this date only by revelation.] VERILY I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;</verse>

The main body of the saints was at that time in Clay County, Missouri. Threats of death against individuals of the Church were many. The people had lost household furniture, clothing, livestock, and other personal property, and many of their crops had been destroyed.] VERILY I say unto you, concerning your brethren who have been afflicted, and persecuted, and cast out from the land of their inheritance-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.2'>I, the Lord, have suffered the affliction to come upon them, wherewith they have been afflicted, in consequence of their transgressions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.3'>Yet I will own them, and they shall be mine in that day when I shall come to make up my jewels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.4'>Therefore, they must needs be chastened and tried, even as Abraham, who was commanded to offer up his only son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.5'>For all those who will not endure chastening, but deny me, cannot be sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.6'>Behold, I say unto you, there were jarrings, and contentions, and envyings, and strifes, and lustful and covetous desires among them; therefore by these things they polluted their inheritances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.7'>They were slow to hearken unto the voice of the Lord their God; therefore, the Lord their God is slow to hearken unto their prayers, to answer them in the day of their trouble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.8'>In the day of their peace they esteemed lightly my counsel; but, in the day of their trouble, of necessity they feel after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.9'>Verily I say unto you, notwithstanding their sins, my bowels are filled with compassion towards them. I will not utterly cast them off; and in the day of wrath I will remember mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.10'>I have sworn, and the decree hath gone forth by a former commandment which I have given unto you, that I would let fall the sword of mine indignation in behalf of my people; and even as I have said, it shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.11'>Mine indignation is soon to be poured out without measure upon all nations; and this will I do when the cup of their iniquity is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.12'>And in that day all who are found upon the watch-tower, or in other words, all mine Israel, shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.13'>And they that have been scattered shall be gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.14'>And all they who have mourned shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.15'>And all they who have given their lives for my name shall be crowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.16'>Therefore, let your hearts be comforted concerning Zion; for all flesh is in mine hands; be still and know that I am God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.17'>Zion shall not be moved out of her place, notwithstanding her children are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.18'>They that remain, and are pure in heart, shall return, and come to their inheritances, they and their children, with songs of everlasting joy, to build up the waste places of Zion-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.19'>And all these things that the prophets might be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.20'>And, behold, there is none other place appointed than that which I have appointed; neither shall there be any other place appointed than that which I have appointed, for the work of the gathering of my saints-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.21'>Until the day cometh when there is found no more room for them; and then I have other places which I will appoint unto them, and they shall be called stakes, for the curtains or the strength of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.22'>Behold, it is my will, that all they who call on my name, and worship me according to mine everlasting gospel, should gather together, and stand in holy places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.23'>And prepare for the revelation which is to come, when the veil of the covering of my temple, in my tabernacle, which hideth the earth, shall be taken off, and all flesh shall see me together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.24'>And every corruptible thing, both of man, or of the beasts of the field, or of the fowls of the heavens, or of the fish of the sea, that dwells upon all the face of the earth, shall be consumed;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.101.28'>And in that day Satan shall not have power to tempt any man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.29'>And there shall be no sorrow because there is no death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.30'>In that day an infant shall not die until he is old; and his life shall be as the age of a tree;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.31'>And when he dies he shall not sleep, that is to say in the earth, but shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and shall be caught up, and his rest shall be glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.32'>Yea, verily I say unto you, in that day when the Lord shall come, he shall reveal all things-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.33'>Things which have passed, and hidden things which no man knew, things of the earth, by which it was made, and the purpose and the end thereof-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.101.35'>And all they who suffer persecution for my name, and endure in faith, though they are called to lay down their lives for my sake yet shall they partake of all this glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.36'>Wherefore, fear not even unto death; for in this world your joy is not full, but in me your joy is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.37'>Therefore, care not for the body, neither the life of the body; but care for the soul, and for the life of the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.38'>And seek the face of the Lord always, that in patience ye may possess your souls, and ye shall have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.39'>When men are called unto mine everlasting gospel, and covenant with an everlasting covenant, they are accounted as the salt of the earth and the savor of men;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.101.43'>And now, I will show unto you a parable, that you may know my will concerning the redemption of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.44'>A certain nobleman had a spot of land, very choice; and he said unto his servants: Go ye unto my vineyard, even upon this very choice piece of land, and plant twelve olive-trees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.45'>And set watchmen round about them, and build a tower, that one may overlook the land round about, to be a watchman upon the tower, that mine olive-trees may not be broken down when the enemy shall come to spoil and take upon themselves the fruit of my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.46'>Now, the servants of the nobleman went and did as their lord commanded them, and planted the olive-trees, and built a hedge round about, and set watchmen, and began to build a tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.47'>And while they were yet laying the foundation thereof, they began to say among themselves: And what need hath my lord of this tower?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.48'>And consulted for a long time, saying among themselves: What need hath my lord of this tower, seeing this is a time of peace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.49'>Might not this money be given to the exchangers? For there is no need of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.50'>And while they were at variance one with another they became very slothful, and they hearkened not unto the commandments of their lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.51'>And the enemy came by night, and broke down the hedge; and the servants of the nobleman arose and were affrighted, and fled; and the enemy destroyed their works, and broke down the olive-trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.52'>Now, behold, the nobleman, the lord of the vineyard, called upon his servants, and said unto them, Why! what is the cause of this great evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.53'>Ought ye not to have done even as I commanded you, and-after ye had planted the vineyard, and built the hedge round about, and set watchmen upon the walls thereof-built the tower also, and set a watchman upon the tower, and watched for my vineyard, and not have fallen asleep, lest the enemy should come upon you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.54'>And behold, the watchman upon the tower would have seen the enemy while he was yet afar off; and then ye could have made ready and kept the enemy from breaking down the hedge thereof, and saved my vineyard from the hands of the destroyer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.55'>And the lord of the vineyard said unto one of his servants: Go and gather together the residue of my servants, and take all the strength of mine house, which are my warriors, my young men, and they that are of middle age also among all my servants, who are the strength of mine house, save those only whom I have appointed to tarry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.56'>And go ye straightway unto the land of my vineyard, and redeem my vineyard; for it is mine; I have bought it with money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.57'>Therefore, get ye straightway unto my land; break down the walls of mine enemies; throw down their tower, and scatter their watchmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.58'>And inasmuch as they gather together against you, avenge me of mine enemies, that by and by I may come with the residue of mine house and possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.59'>And the servant said unto his lord: When shall these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.60'>And he said unto his servant: When I will; go ye straightway, and do all things whatsoever I have commanded you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.61'>And this shall be my seal and blessing upon you-a faithful and wise steward in the midst of mine house, a ruler in my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.62'>And his servant went straightway, and did all things whatsoever his lord commanded him; and after many days all things were fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.63'>Again, verily I say unto you, I will show unto you wisdom in me concerning all the churches, inasmuch as they are willing to be guided in a right and proper way for their salvation-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.64'>That the work of the gathering together of my saints may continue, that I may build them up unto my name upon holy places; for the time of harvest is come, and my word must needs be fulfilled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.101.68'>Nevertheless, as I have said unto you in a former commandment, let not your gathering be in haste, nor by flight; but let all things be prepared before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.69'>And in order that all things be prepared before you, observe the commandment which I have given concerning these things-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.70'>Which saith, or teacheth, to purchase all the lands with money, which can be purchased for money, in the region round about the land which I have appointed to be the land of Zion, for the beginning of the gathering of my saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.71'>All the land which can be purchased in Jackson county, and the counties round about, and leave the residue in mine hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.72'>Now, verily I say unto you, let all the churches gather together all their moneys; let these things be done in their time, but not in haste; and observe to have all things prepared before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.73'>And let honorable men be appointed, even wise men, and send them to purchase these lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.74'>And the churches in the eastern countries, when they are built up, if they will hearken unto this counsel they may buy lands and gather together upon them; and in this way they may establish Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.75'>There is even now already in store sufficient, yea, even an abundance, to redeem Zion, and establish her waste places, no more to be thrown down, were the churches, who call themselves after my name, willing to hearken to my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.76'>And again I say unto you, those who have been scattered by their enemies, it is my will that they should continue to importune for redress, and redemption, by the hands of those who are placed as rulers and are in authority over you-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.77'>According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.101.80'>And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.81'>Now, unto what shall I liken the children of Zion? I will liken them unto the parable of the woman and the unjust judge, for men ought always to pray and not to faint, which saith-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.82'>There was in a city a judge which feared not God, neither regarded man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.83'>And there was a widow in that city, and she came unto him, saying: Avenge me of mine adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.84'>And he would not for a while, but afterward he said within himself: Though I fear not God, nor regard man, yet because this widow troubleth me I will avenge her, lest by her continual coming she weary me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.85'>Thus will I liken the children of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.86'>Let them importune at the feet of the judge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.87'>And if he heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the governor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.88'>And if the governor heed them not, let them importune at the feet of the president;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.89'>And if the president heed them not, then will the Lord arise and come forth out of his hiding place, and in his fury vex the nation;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.101.95'>That I may proceed to bring to pass my act, my strange act, and perform my work, my strange work, that men may discern between the righteous and the wicked, saith your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.96'>And again, I say unto you, it is contrary to my commandment and my will that my servant Sidney Gilbert should sell my storehouse, which I have appointed unto my people, into the hands of mine enemies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.101.99'>Therefore, it is my will that my people should claim, and hold claim upon that which I have appointed unto them, though they should not be permitted to dwell thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.100'>Nevertheless, I do not say they shall not dwell thereon; for inasmuch as they bring forth fruit and works meet for my kingdom they shall dwell thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.101.101'>They shall build, and another shall not inherit it; they shall plant vineyards, and they shall eat the fruit thereof. Even so. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.102.1'>[Minutes of the organization of the first high council of the Church, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 17, 1834. HC 2: 28-31. The original minutes were recorded by Elders Oliver Cowdery and Orson Hyde. Two days later, the minutes were corrected by the Prophet, read to the high council, and accepted by the council. Verses 30-32, having to do with the Council of the Twelve Apostles, were added by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1835 when he prepared this section for publication in the Doctrine and Covenants.] THIS day a general council of twenty-four high priests assembled at the house of Joseph Smith, Jun., by revelation, and proceeded to organize the high council of the church of Christ, which was to consist of twelve high priests, and one or three presidents as the case might require.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.2'>The high council was appointed by revelation for the purpose of settling important difficulties which might arise in the church, which could not be settled by the church or the bishop's council to the satisfaction of the parties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.3'>Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams were acknowledged presidents by the voice of the council; and Joseph Smith, Sen., John Smith, Joseph Coe, John Johnson, Martin Harris, John S. Carter, Jared Carter, Oliver Cowdery, Samuel H. Smith, Orson Hyde, Sylvester Smith, and Luke Johnson, high priests, were chosen to be a standing council for the church, by the unanimous voice of the council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.4'>The above-named councilors were then asked whether they accepted their appointments, and whether they would act in that office according to the law of heaven, to which they all answered that they accepted their appointments, and would fill their offices according to the grace of God bestowed upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.5'>The number composing the council, who voted in the name and for the church in appointing the above-named councilors were forty-three, as follows: nine high priests, seventeen elders, four priests, and thirteen members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.6'>Voted: that the high council cannot have power to act without seven of the above-named councilors, or their regularly appointed successors are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.7'>These seven shall have power to appoint other high priests, whom they may consider worthy and capable to act in the place of absent councilors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.8'>Voted: that whenever any vacancy shall occur by the death, removal from office for transgression, or removal from the bounds of this church government, of any one of the above-named councilors, it shall be filled by the nomination of the president or presidents, and sanctioned by the voice of a general council of high priests, convened for that purpose, to act in the name of the church.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.102.13'>Whenever this council convenes to act upon any case, the twelve councilors shall consider whether it is a difficult one or not; if it is not, two only of the councilors shall speak upon it, according to the form above written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.14'>But if it is thought to be difficult, four shall be appointed; and if more difficult, six; but in no case shall more than six be appointed to speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.102.20'>But should the remaining councilors, who have not spoken, or any one of them, after hearing the evidences and pleadings impartially, discover an error in the decision of the president, they can manifest it, and the case shall have a re-hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.21'>And if, after a careful re-hearing, any additional light is shown upon the case, the decision shall be altered accordingly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.103.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, February 24, 1834. HC 2: 36-39. This revelation was received after the arrival in Kirtland, Ohio, of Parley P. Pratt and Lyman Wight, who had come from Missouri to counsel with the Prophet as to the relief and restoration of the saints to their lands in Jackson County.] VERILY I say unto you, my friends, behold, I will give unto you a revelation and commandment, that you may know how to act in the discharge of your duties concerning the salvation and redemption of your brethren, who have been scattered on the land of Zion;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.2'>Being driven and smitten by the hands of mine enemies, on whom I will pour out my wrath without measure in mine own time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.3'>For I have suffered them thus far, that they might fill up the measure of their iniquities, that their cup might be full;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.4'>And that those who call themselves after my name might be chastened for a little season with a sore and grievous chastisement, because they did not hearken altogether unto the precepts and commandments which I gave unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.5'>But verily I say unto you, that I have decreed a decree which my people shall realize, inasmuch as they hearken from this very hour unto the counsel which I, the Lord their God, shall give unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.6'>Behold they shall, for I have decreed it, begin to prevail against mine enemies from this very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.7'>And by hearkening to observe all the words which I, the Lord their God, shall speak unto them, they shall never cease to prevail until the kingdoms of the world are subdued under my feet, and the earth is given unto the saints, to possess it forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.8'>But inasmuch as they keep not my commandments, and hearken not to observe all my words, the kingdoms of the world shall prevail against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.9'>For they were set to be a light unto the world, and to be the saviors of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.10'>And inasmuch as they are not the saviors of men, they are as salt that has lost its savor, and is thenceforth good for nothing but to be cast out and trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.11'>But verily I say unto you, I have decreed that your brethren which have been scattered shall return to the lands of their inheritances, and shall build up the waste places of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.12'>For after much tribulation, as I have said unto you in a former commandment, cometh the blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.13'>Behold, this is the blessing which I have promised after your tribulations, and the tribulations of your brethren-your redemption, and the redemption of your brethren, even their restoration to the land of Zion, to be established, no more to be thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.14'>Nevertheless, if they pollute their inheritances they shall be thrown down; for I will not spare them if they pollute their inheritances.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.103.16'>Therefore, I will raise up unto my people a man, who shall lead them like as Moses led the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.17'>For ye are the children of Israel, and of the seed of Abraham, and ye must needs be led out of bondage by power, and with a stretched-out arm.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.103.19'>Therefore, let not your hearts faint, for I say not unto you as I said unto your fathers: Mine angel shall go up before you, but not my presence.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.103.21'>Verily, verily I say unto you, that my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., is the man to whom I likened the servant to whom the Lord of the vineyard spake in the parable which I have given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.22'>Therefore let my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., say unto the strength of my house, my young men and the middle aged-Gather yourselves together unto the land of Zion, upon the land which I have bought with money that has been consecrated unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.23'>And let all the churches send up wise men with their moneys, and purchase lands even as I have commanded them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.103.25'>And whomsoever ye curse, I will curse, and ye shall avenge me of mine enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.26'>And my presence shall be with you even in avenging me of mine enemies, unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.27'>Let no man be afraid to lay down his life for my sake; for whoso layeth down his life for my sake shall find it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.28'>And whoso is not willing to lay down his life for my sake is not my disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.29'>It is my will that my servant Sidney Rigdon shall lift up his voice in the congregations in the eastern countries, in preparing the churches to keep the commandments which I have given unto them concerning the restoration and redemption of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.30'>It is my will that my servant Parley P. Pratt and my servant Lyman Wight should not return to the land of their brethren, until they have obtained companies to go up unto the land of Zion, by tens, or by twenties, or by fifties, or by an hundred, until they have obtained to the number of five hundred of the strength of my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.31'>Behold this is my will; ask and ye shall receive; but men do not always do my will.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.103.33'>And if ye cannot obtain three hundred, seek diligently that peradventure ye may obtain one hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.34'>But verily I say unto you, a commandment I give unto you, that ye shall not go up unto the land of Zion until you have obtained a hundred of the strength of my house, to go up with you unto the land of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.35'>Therefore, as I said unto you, ask and ye shall receive; pray earnestly that peradventure my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., may go with you, and preside in the midst of my people, and organize my kingdom upon the consecrated land, and establish the children of Zion upon the laws and commandments which have been and which shall be given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.36'>All victory and glory is brought to pass unto you through your diligence, faithfulness, and prayers of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.103.37'>Let my servant Parley P. Pratt journey with my servant Joseph Smith, Jun.</verse>

The occasion was that of a council meeting of the First Presidency and other high priests, in which the pressing temporal needs of the people had been given consideration. The United Order at Kirtland was to be temporarily dissolved and reorganized, and the properties as stewardships were to be divided among members of the order.] VERILY I say unto you, my friends, I give unto you counsel, and a commandment, concerning all the properties which belong to the order which I commanded to be organized and established, to be a united order, and an everlasting order for the benefit of my church, and for the salvation of men until I come-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.104.2'>With promise immutable and unchangeable, that inasmuch as those whom I commanded were faithful they should be blessed with a multiplicity of blessings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.104.3'>But inasmuch as they were not faithful they were nigh unto cursing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.104.4'>Therefore, inasmuch as some of my servants have not kept the commandment, but have broken the covenant through covetousness, and with feigned words, I have cursed them with a very sore and grievous curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.104.5'>For I, the Lord, have decreed in my heart, that inasmuch as any man belonging to the order shall be found a transgressor, or, in other words, shall break the covenant with which ye are bound, he shall be cursed in his life, and shall be trodden down by whom I will;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.104.6'>For I, the Lord, am not to be mocked in these things-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.105.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, on Fishing River, Missouri, June 22, 1834. HC 2: 108-111. Mob violence against the saints in Missouri had increased, and organized bodies from several counties had declared their intent to destroy the people. The Prophet had come from Kirtland at the head of a party known as Zion's Camp, bringing clothing and provisions. While this party was encamped on Fishing River, the Prophet received the revelation.] VERILY I say unto you who have assembled yourselves together that you may learn my will concerning the redemption of mine afflicted people-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.107.1'>[Revelation on priesthood, given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, dated March 28, 1835. HC 2: 209-217. On the date named the Twelve met in council, confessing their individual weaknesses and shortcomings, expressing repentance, and seeking the further guidance of the Lord. They were about to separate on missions to districts assigned. Although portions of this section were received on the date named, the historical records affirm that various parts were received at sundry times, some as early as November 1831.] THERE are, in the church, two priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.2'>Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek was such a great high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.3'>Before his day it was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.4'>But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.5'>All other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to this priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.6'>But there are two divisions or grand heads-one is the Melchizedek Priesthood, and the other is the Aaronic or Levitical Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.7'>The office of an elder comes under the priesthood of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.8'>The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the right of presidency, and has power and authority over all the offices in the church in all ages of the world, to administer in spiritual things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.9'>The Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchizedek, have a right to officiate in all the offices in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.10'>High priests after the order of the Melchizedek Priesthood have a right to officiate in their own standing, under the direction of the presidency, in administering spiritual things, and also in the office of an elder, priest (of the Levitical order), teacher, deacon, and member.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.11'>An elder has a right to officiate in his stead when the high priest is not present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.12'>The high priest and elder are to administer in spiritual things, agreeable to the covenants and commandments of the church; and they have a right to officiate in all these offices of the church when there are no higher authorities present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.13'>The second priesthood is called the Priesthood of Aaron, because it was conferred upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.14'>Why it is called the lesser priesthood is because it is an appendage to the greater, or the Melchizedek Priesthood, and has power in administering outward ordinances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.15'>The bishopric is the presidency of this priesthood, and holds the keys or authority of the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.16'>No man has a legal right to this office, to hold the keys of this priesthood, except he be a literal descendant of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.17'>But as a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices, he may officiate in the office of bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power by the hands of the Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.18'>The power and authority of the higher, or Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.19'>To have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, to have the heavens opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn, and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.20'>The power and authority of the lesser, or Aaronic Priesthood, is to hold the keys of the ministering of angels, and to administer in outward ordinances, the letter of the gospel, the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, agreeable to the covenants and commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.21'>Of necessity there are presidents, or presiding officers growing out of, or appointed of or from among those who are ordained to the several offices in these two priesthoods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.22'>Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding High Priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.107.25'>The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world-thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.26'>And they form a quorum, equal in authority to that of the Twelve special witnesses or Apostles just named.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.27'>And every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions, in order to make their decisions of the same power or validity one with the other-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.28'>A majority may form a quorum when circumstances render it impossible to be otherwise-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.29'>Unless this is the case, their decisions are not entitled to the same blessings which the decisions of a quorum of three presidents were anciently, who were ordained after the order of Melchizedek, and were righteous and holy men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.30'>The decisions of these quorums, or either of them, are to be made in all righteousness, in holiness, and lowliness of heart, meekness and long suffering, and in faith, and virtue, and knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and charity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.31'>Because the promise is, if these things abound in them they shall not be unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.32'>And in case that any decision of these quorums is made in unrighteousness, it may be brought before a general assembly of the several quorums, which constitute the spiritual authorities of the church; otherwise there can be no appeal from their decision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.33'>The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and secondly unto the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.34'>The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling high council, in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.107.41'>This order was instituted in the days of Adam, and came down by lineage in the following manner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.42'>From Adam to Seth, who was ordained by Adam at the age of sixty-nine years, and was blessed by him three years previous to his (Adam's) death, and received the promise of God by his father, that his posterity should be the chosen of the Lord, and that they should be preserved unto the end of the earth;</verse>

HC 3: 44. The law of tithing, as understood today, had not been given to the Church previous to this revelation. The term "tithing" in the prayer just quoted and in previous revelations (64: 23; 85: 3; 97: 11) had meant not just one-tenth, but all free-will offerings, or contributions, to the Church funds. The Lord had previously given to the Church the law of consecration and stewardship of property, which members (chiefly the leading elders) entered into by a covenant that was to be everlasting. Because of failure on the part of many to abide by this covenant, the Lord withdrew it for a time, and gave instead the law of tithing to the whole Church. The Prophet asked the Lord how much of their property he required for sacred purposes. The answer was this revelation.] VERILY, thus saith the Lord, I require all their surplus property to be put into the hands of the bishop of my church in Zion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.119.2'>For the building of mine house, and for the laying of the foundation of Zion and for the priesthood, and for the debts of the Presidency of my Church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.119.3'>And this shall be the beginning of the tithing of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.119.4'>And after that, those who have thus been tithed shall pay one-tenth of all their interest annually; and this shall be a standing law unto them forever, for my holy priesthood, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.119.5'>Verily I say unto you, it shall come to pass that all those who gather unto the land of Zion shall be tithed of their surplus properties, and shall observe this law, or they shall not be found worthy to abide among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.119.6'>And I say unto you, if my people observe not this law, to keep it holy, and by this law sanctify the land of Zion unto me, that my statutes and my judgments may be kept thereon, that it may be most holy, behold, verily I say unto you, it shall not be a land of Zion unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.119.7'>And this shall be an ensample unto all the stakes of Zion. Even so. Amen.</verse>

HC 5: 142-144.] FORASMUCH as the Lord has revealed unto me that my enemies, both in Missouri and this State, were again in the pursuit of me; and inasmuch as they pursue me without a cause, and have not the least shadow or coloring of justice or right on their side in the getting up of their prosecutions against me; and inasmuch as their pretensions are all founded in falsehood of the blackest dye, I have thought it expedient and wisdom in me to leave the place for a short season, for my own safety and the safety of this people. I would say to all those with whom I have business, that I have left my affairs with agents and clerks who will transact all business in a prompt and proper manner, and will see that all my debts are canceled in due time, by turning out property, or otherwise, as the case may require, or as the circumstances may admit of.

Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth all these things, whether it be good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation; for to this day has the God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath spoken it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.128'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.1'>[An epistle from Joseph Smith the Prophet to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, containing further directions on baptism for the dead; dated at Nauvoo, Illinois, September 6, 1842. HC 5: 148-153.] AS I stated to you in my letter before I left my place, that I would write to you from time to time and give you information in relation to many subjects, I now resume the subject of the baptism for the dead, as that subject seems to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest, since I have been pursued by my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.2'>I wrote a few words of revelation to you concerning a recorder. I have had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify. That is, it was declared in my former letter that there should be a recorder, who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might make a record of a truth before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.3'>Now, in relation to this matter, it would be very difficult for one recorder to be present at all times, and to do all the business. To obviate this difficulty, there can be a recorder appointed in each ward of the city, who is well qualified for taking accurate minutes; and let him be very particular and precise in taking the whole proceedings, certifying in his record that he saw with his eyes, and heard with his ears, giving the date, and names, and so forth, and the history of the whole transaction; naming also some three individuals that are present, if there be any present, who can at any time when called upon certify to the same, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.4'>Then, let there be a general recorder, to whom these other records can be handed, being attended with certificates over their own signatures, certifying that the record they have made is true. Then the general church recorder can enter the record on the general church book, with the certificates and all the attending witnesses, with his own statement that he verily believes the above statement and records to be true, from his knowledge of the general character and appointment of those men by the church. And when this is done on the general church book, the record shall be just as holy, and shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he had seen with his eyes and heard with his ears, and made a record of the same on the general church book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.5'>You may think this order of things to be very particular; but let me tell you that it is only to answer the will of God, by conforming to the ordinance and preparation that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation of the world, for the salvation of the dead who should die without a knowledge of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.6'>And further, I want you to remember that John the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declared, as you will find recorded in Revelation 20:12-And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.7'>You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works; consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the record of their works, and refer to the records which are kept on the earth. And the book which was the book of life is the record which is kept in heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with the doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation contained in the letter which I wrote to you previous to my leaving my place-that in all your recordings it may be recorded in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.8'>Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be recorded in heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be judged, according to their own works, whether they themselves have attended to the ordinances in their own propria persona, or by the means of their own agents, according to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation from before the foundation of the world, according to the records which they have kept concerning their dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.9'>It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of-a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the priesthood to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power has always been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in the name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is a faithful saying. Who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.10'>And again, for the precedent, Matthew 16:18, 19: And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.11'>Now the great and grand secret of the whole matter, and the summum bonum of the whole subject that is lying before us, consists in obtaining the powers of the Holy Priesthood. For him to whom these keys are given there is no difficulty in obtaining a knowledge of facts in relation to the salvation of the children of men, both as well for the dead as for the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.12'>Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life-The ordinance of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer to the likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other; to be immersed in the water and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their graves; hence, this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with the ordinance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.13'>Consequently, the baptismal font was instituted as a similitude of the grave, and was commanded to be in a place underneath where the living are wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the dead, and that all things may have their likeness, and that they may accord one with another-that which is earthly conforming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hath declared, 1 Corinthians 15:46, 47, and 48:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.14'>Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as are the records on the earth in relation to your dead, which are truly made out, so also are the records in heaven. This, therefore, is the sealing and binding power, and, in one sense of the word, the keys of the kingdom, which consist in the key of knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.15'>And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the fathers-that they without us cannot be made perfect-neither can we without our dead be made perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.16'>And now, in relation to the baptism for the dead, I will give you another quotation of Paul, 1 Corinthians 15:29: Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.17'>And again, in connection with this quotation I will give you a quotation from one of the prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restoration of the priesthood, the glories to be revealed in the last days, and in an especial manner this most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting gospel, namely, the baptism for the dead; for Malachi says, last chapter, verses 5th and 6th: Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.18'>I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other-and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.19'>Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth! As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.20'>And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets-the book to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca county, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book! The voice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil when he appeared as an angel of light! The voice of Peter, James, and John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.21'>And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old Father Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through all the travels and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! And the voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam down to the present time, all declaring their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little; giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come, confirming our hope!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.22'>Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.23'>Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.24'>Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand; and who can abide the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap; and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Let us, therefore, as a church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and let us present in his holy temple, when it is finished, a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.25'>Brethren, I have many things to say to you on the subject; but shall now close for the present, and continue the subject another time. I am, as ever, your humble servant and never deviating friend,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.132.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Nauvoo, Illinois, recorded July 12, 1843, relating to the new and everlasting covenant, including the eternity of the marriage covenant, as also plurality of wives. HC 5: 501-507. Although the revelation was recorded in 1843, it is evident from the historical records that the doctrines and principles involved in this revelation had been known by the Prophet since 1831.] VERILY, thus saith the Lord unto you my servant Joseph, that inasmuch as you have inquired of my hand to know and understand wherein I, the Lord, justified my servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as also Moses, David and Solomon, my servants, as touching the principle and doctrine of their having many wives and concubines-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.2'>Behold, and lo, I am the Lord thy God, and will answer thee as touching this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.3'>Therefore, prepare thy heart to receive and obey the instructions which I am about to give unto you; for all those who have this law revealed unto them must obey the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.4'>For behold, I reveal unto you a new and an everlasting covenant; and if ye abide not that covenant, then are ye damned; for no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.5'>For all who will have a blessing at my hands shall abide the law which was appointed for that blessing, and the conditions thereof, as were instituted from before the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.6'>And as pertaining to the new and everlasting covenant, it was instituted for the fulness of my glory; and he that receiveth a fulness thereof must and shall abide the law, or he shall be damned, saith the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.7'>And verily I say unto you, that the conditions of this law are these: All covenants, contracts, bonds, obligations, oaths, vows, performances, connections, associations, or expectations, that are not made and entered into and sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, of him who is anointed, both as well for time and for all eternity, and that too most holy, by revelation and commandment through the medium of mine anointed, whom I have appointed on the earth to hold this power (and I have appointed unto my servant Joseph to hold this power in the last days, and there is never but one on the earth at a time on whom this power and the keys of this priesthood are conferred), are of no efficacy, virtue, or force in and after the resurrection from the dead; for all contracts that are not made unto this end have an end when men are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.8'>Behold, mine house is a house of order, saith the Lord God, and not a house of confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.9'>Will I accept of an offering, saith the Lord, that is not made in my name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.10'>Or will I receive at your hands that which I have not appointed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.11'>And will I appoint unto you, saith the Lord, except it be by law, even as I and my Father ordained unto you, before the world was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.12'>I am the Lord thy God; and I give unto you this commandment-that no man shall come unto the Father but by me or by my word, which is my law, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.13'>And everything that is in the world, whether it be ordained of men, by thrones, or principalities, or powers, or things of name, whatsoever they may be, that are not by me or by my word, saith the Lord, shall be thrown down, and shall not remain after men are dead, neither in nor after the resurrection, saith the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.14'>For whatsoever things remain are by me; and whatsoever things are not by me shall be shaken and destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.15'>Therefore, if a man marry him a wife in the world, and he marry her not by me nor by my word, and he covenant with her so long as he is in the world and she with him, their covenant and marriage are not of force when they are dead, and when they are out of the world; therefore, they are not bound by any law when they are out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.16'>Therefore, when they are out of the world they neither marry nor are given in marriage; but are appointed angels in heaven, which angels are ministering servants, to minister for those who are worthy of a far more, and an exceeding, and an eternal weight of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.17'>For these angels did not abide my law; therefore, they cannot be enlarged, but remain separately and singly, without exaltation, in their saved condition, to all eternity; and from henceforth are not gods, but are angels of God forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.18'>And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife, and make a covenant with her for time and for all eternity, if that covenant is not by me or by my word, which is my law, and is not sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, through him whom I have anointed and appointed unto this power, then it is not valid neither of force when they are out of the world, because they are not joined by me, saith the Lord, neither by my word; when they are out of the world it cannot be received there, because the angels and the gods are appointed there, by whom they cannot pass; they cannot, therefore, inherit my glory; for my house is a house of order, saith the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.19'>And again, verily I say unto you, if a man marry a wife by my word, which is my law, and by the new and everlasting covenant, and it is sealed unto them by the Holy Spirit of promise, by him who is anointed, unto whom I have appointed this power and the keys of this priesthood; and it shall be said unto them-Ye shall come forth in the first resurrection; and if it be after the first resurrection, in the next resurrection; and shall inherit thrones, kingdoms, principalities, and powers, dominions, all heights and depths-then shall it be written in the Lamb's Book of Life, that he shall commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, and if ye abide in my covenant, and commit no murder whereby to shed innocent blood, it shall be done unto them in all things whatsoever my servant hath put upon them, in time, and through all eternity; and shall be of full force when they are out of the world; and they shall pass by the angels, and the gods, which are set there, to their exaltation and glory in all things, as hath been sealed upon their heads, which glory shall be a fulness and a continuation of the seeds forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.20'>Then shall they be gods, because they have no end; therefore shall they be from everlasting to everlasting, because they continue; then shall they be above all, because all things are subject unto them. Then shall they be gods, because they have all power, and the angels are subject unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.21'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, except ye abide my law ye cannot attain to this glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.22'>For strait is the gate, and narrow the way that leadeth unto the exaltation and continuation of the lives, and few there be that find it, because ye receive me not in the world neither do ye know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.23'>But if ye receive me in the world, then shall ye know me, and shall receive your exaltation; that where I am ye shall be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.24'>This is eternal lives-to know the only wise and true God, and Jesus Christ, whom he hath sent. I am he. Receive ye, therefore, my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.25'>Broad is the gate, and wide the way that leadeth to the deaths; and many there are that go in thereat, because they receive me not, neither do they abide in my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.26'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man marry a wife according to my word, and they are sealed by the Holy Spirit of promise, according to mine appointment, and he or she shall commit any sin or transgression of the new and everlasting covenant whatever, and all manner of blasphemies, and if they commit no murder wherein they shed innocent blood, yet they shall come forth in the first resurrection, and enter into their exaltation; but they shall be destroyed in the flesh, and shall be delivered unto the buffetings of Satan unto the day of redemption, saith the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.27'>The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost, which shall not be forgiven in the world nor out of the world, is in that ye commit murder wherein ye shed innocent blood, and assent unto my death, after ye have received my new and everlasting covenant, saith the Lord God; and he that abideth not this law can in nowise enter into my glory, but shall be damned, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.28'>I am the Lord thy God, and will give unto thee the law of my Holy Priesthood, as was ordained by me and my Father before the world was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.29'>Abraham received all things, whatsoever he received, by revelation and commandment, by my word, saith the Lord, and hath entered into his exaltation and sitteth upon his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.30'>Abraham received promises concerning his seed, and of the fruit of his loins-from whose loins ye are, namely, my servant Joseph-which were to continue so long as they were in the world; and as touching Abraham and his seed, out of the world they should continue; both in the world and out of the world should they continue as innumerable as the stars; or, if ye were to count the sand upon the seashore ye could not number them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.31'>This promise is yours also, because ye are of Abraham, and the promise was made unto Abraham; and by this law is the continuation of the works of my Father, wherein he glorifieth himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.32'>Go ye, therefore, and do the works of Abraham; enter ye into my law and ye shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.33'>But if ye enter not into my law ye cannot receive the promise of my Father, which he made unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.34'>God commanded Abraham, and Sarah gave Hagar to Abraham to wife. And why did she do it? Because this was the law; and from Hagar sprang many people. This, therefore, was fulfilling, among other things, the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.35'>Was Abraham, therefore, under condemnation? Verily I say unto you, Nay; for I, the Lord, commanded it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.36'>Abraham was commanded to offer his son Isaac; nevertheless, it was written: Thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however, did not refuse, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.37'>Abraham received concubines, and they bore him children; and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law; as Isaac also and Jacob did none other things than that which they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.38'>David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received not of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.39'>David's wives and concubines were given unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.40'>I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee, my servant Joseph, an appointment, and restore all things. Ask what ye will, and it shall be given unto you according to my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.41'>And as ye have asked concerning adultery, verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man receiveth a wife in the new and everlasting covenant, and if she be with another man, and I have not appointed unto her by the holy anointing, she hath committed adultery and shall be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.42'>If she be not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with another man, she has committed adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.43'>And if her husband be with another woman, and he was under a vow, he hath broken his vow and hath committed adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.44'>And if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her and give her unto him that hath not committed adultery but hath been faithful; for he shall be made ruler over many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.45'>For I have conferred upon you the keys and power of the priesthood, wherein I restore all things, and make known unto you all things in due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.46'>And verily, verily, I say unto you, that whatsoever you seal on earth shall be sealed in heaven; and whatsoever you bind on earth, in my name and by my word, saith the Lord, it shall be eternally bound in the heavens; and whosesoever sins you remit on earth shall be remitted eternally in the heavens; and whosesoever sins you retain on earth shall be retained in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.47'>And again, verily I say, whomsoever you bless I will bless, and whomsoever you curse I will curse, saith the Lord; for I, the Lord, am thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.48'>And again, verily I say unto you, my servant Joseph, that whatsoever you give on earth, and to whomsoever you give any one on earth, by my word and according to my law, it shall be visited with blessings and not cursings, and with my power, saith the Lord, and shall be without condemnation on earth and in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.49'>For I am the Lord thy God, and will be with thee even unto the end of the world, and through all eternity; for verily I seal upon you your exaltation, and prepare a throne for you in the kingdom of my Father, with Abraham your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.50'>Behold, I have seen your sacrifices, and will forgive all your sins; I have seen your sacrifices in obedience to that which I have told you. Go, therefore, and I make a way for your escape, as I accepted the offering of Abraham of his son Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.51'>Verily, I say unto you: A commandment I give unto mine handmaid, Emma Smith, your wife, whom I have given unto you, that she stay herself and partake not of that which I commanded you to offer unto her; for I did it, saith the Lord, to prove you all, as I did Abraham, and that I might require an offering at your hand, by covenant and sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.52'>And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.53'>For I am the Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things; for he hath been faithful over a few things, and from henceforth I will strengthen him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.54'>And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.55'>But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him and give unto him an hundredfold in this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.56'>And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her, and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.57'>And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham, thy father, even unto his exaltation and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.58'>Now, as touching the law of the priesthood, there are many things pertaining thereunto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.59'>Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron, by mine own voice, and by the voice of him that sent me, and I have endowed him with the keys of the power of this priesthood, if he do anything in my name, and according to my law and by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.60'>Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.61'>And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood-if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.62'>And if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore is he justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.63'>But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.64'>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.65'>Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.66'>And now, as pertaining to this law, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will reveal more unto you, hereafter; therefore, let this suffice for the present. Behold, I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.</verse>

HC 2: 247-249. The occasion was a meeting of Church leaders, brought together to consider the proposed contents of the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. At that time this declaration was given the following preamble: "That our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood, we have thought proper to present at the close of this volume our opinion concerning the same."] WE believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.2'>We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.3'>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.4'>We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men are amenable to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.5'>We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; and that sedition and rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.6'>We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men show respect and deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and nations, between man and man; and divine laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both to be answered by man to his Maker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.7'>We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise of their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right in justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.8'>We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that government in which the offense is committed; and for the public peace and tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders against good laws to punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.9'>We do not believe it just to mingle religious influence with civil government, whereby one religious society is fostered and another proscribed in its spiritual privileges, and the individual rights of its members, as citizens, denied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.10'>We believe that all religious societies have a right to deal with their members for disorderly conduct, according to the rules and regulations of such societies; provided that such dealings be for fellowship and good standing; but we do not believe that any religious society has authority to try men on the right of property or life, to take from them this world's goods, or to put them in jeopardy of either life or limb, or to inflict any physical punishment upon them. They can only excommunicate them from their society, and withdraw from them their fellowship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.11'>We believe that men should appeal to the civil law for redress of all wrongs and grievances, where personal abuse is inflicted or the right of property or character infringed, where such laws exist as will protect the same; but we believe that all men are justified in defending themselves, their friends, and property, and the government, from the unlawful assaults and encroachments of all persons in times of exigency, where immediate appeal cannot be made to the laws, and relief afforded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.12'>We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world; but we do not believe it right to interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor to meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men; such interference we believe to be unlawful and unjust, and dangerous to the peace of every government allowing human beings to be held in servitude.</verse>

This document was written by Elder John Taylor of the Council of the Twelve, who was a witness to the events.] TO seal the testimony of this book and the Book of Mormon, we announce the martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith the Patriarch. They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27th of June, 1844, about five o'clock p.m., by an armed mob-painted black-of from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: I am a dead man! Joseph leaped from the window, and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming: O Lord my God! They were both shot after they were dead, in a brutal manner, and both received four balls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.2'>John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only persons in the room at the time; the former was wounded in a savage manner with four balls, but has since recovered; the latter, through the providence of God, escaped, without even a hole in his robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.3'>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.4'>When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said: "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I SHALL DIE INNOCENT, AND IT SHALL YET BE SAID OF ME-HE WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD."-The same morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go-shall it be said to the slaughter? yes, for so it was-he read the following paragraph, near the close of the twelfth chapter of Ether, in the Book of Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.5'>And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father. And now I . . . bid farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood. The testators are now dead, and their testament is in force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.6'>Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in February, 1844, and Joseph Smith was thirty-eight in December, 1843; and henceforward their names will be classed among the martyrs of religion; and the reader in every nation will be reminded that the Book of Mormon, and this book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring them forth for the salvation of a ruined world; and that if the fire can scathe a green tree for the glory of God, how easy it will burn up the dry trees to purify the vineyard of corruption. They lived for glory; they died for glory; and glory is their eternal reward. From age to age shall their names go down to posterity as gems for the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.7'>They were innocent of any crime, as they had often been proved before, and were only confined in jail by the conspiracy of traitors and wicked men; and their innocent blood on the floor of Carthage jail is a broad seal affixed to "Mormonism" that cannot be rejected by any court on earth, and their innocent blood on the escutcheon of the State of Illinois, with the broken faith of the State as pledged by the governor, is a witness to the truth of the everlasting gospel that all the world cannot impeach; and their innocent blood on the banner of liberty, and on the magna charta of the United States, is an ambassador for the religion of Jesus Christ, that will touch the hearts of honest men among all nations; and their innocent blood, with the innocent blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts till he avenges that blood on the earth.

        <verse osisID='Neh.137.1'>[A vision given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, in the temple at Kirtland, Ohio, January 21, 1836. HC 2: 380-381. The occasion was the administration of the ordinances of the endowment as far as they had then been revealed.] THE heavens were opened upon us, and I beheld the celestial kingdom of God, and the glory thereof, whether in the body or out I cannot tell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.2'>I saw the transcendent beauty of the gate through which the heirs of that kingdom will enter, which was like unto circling flames of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.3'>Also the blazing throne of God, whereon was seated the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.4'>I saw the beautiful streets of that kingdom, which had the appearance of being paved with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.5'>I saw Father Adam and Abraham; and my father and my mother; my brother Alvin, that has long since slept;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.6'>And marveled how it was that he had obtained an inheritance in that kingdom, seeing that he had departed this life before the Lord had set his hand to gather Israel the second time, and had not been baptized for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.7'>Thus came the voice of the Lord unto me, saying: All who have died without a knowledge of this gospel, who would have received it if they had been permitted to tarry, shall be heirs of the celestial kingdom of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.8'>Also all that shall die henceforth without a knowledge of it, who would have received it with all their hearts, shall be heirs of that kingdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.9'>For I, the Lord, will judge all men according to their works, according to the desire of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.137.10'>And I also beheld that all children who die before they arrive at the years of accountability are saved in the celestial kingdom of heaven.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.138'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.1'>[A vision, given to President Joseph F. Smith in Salt Lake City, Utah, on October 3, 1918. In his opening address at the eighty-ninth Semiannual General Conference of the Church, on October 4, 1918, President Smith declared that he had received several divine communications during the previous months. One of these, concerning the Savior's visit to the spirits of the dead while his body was in the tomb, he had received the previous day. It was written immediately following the close of the conference; on October 31, 1918, it was submitted to the counselors in the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Patriarch, and it was unanimously accepted by them.] ON the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.2'>And reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.3'>And the great and wonderful love made manifest by the Father and the Son in the coming of the Redeemer into the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.4'>That through his atonement, and by obedience to the principles of the gospel, mankind might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.5'>While I was thus engaged, my mind reverted to the writings of the apostle Peter, to the primitive saints scattered abroad throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, and other parts of Asia, where the gospel had been preached after the crucifixion of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.6'>I opened the Bible and read the third and fourth chapters of the first epistle of Peter, and as I read I was greatly impressed, more than I had ever been before, with the following passages:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.7'>"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.8'>"By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.9'>"Which sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by water." (1 Peter 3:18-20.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.10'>"For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit." (1 Peter 4:6.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.11'>As I pondered over these things which are written, the eyes of my understanding were opened, and the Spirit of the Lord rested upon me, and I saw the hosts of the dead, both small and great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.12'>And there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, who had been faithful in the testimony of Jesus while they lived in mortality;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.13'>And who had offered sacrifice in the similitude of the great sacrifice of the Son of God, and had suffered tribulation in their Redeemer's name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.14'>All these had departed the mortal life, firm in the hope of a glorious resurrection, through the grace of God the Father and his Only Begotten Son, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.15'>I beheld that they were filled with joy and gladness, and were rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.16'>They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.17'>Their sleeping dust was to be restored unto its perfect frame, bone to his bone, and the sinews and the flesh upon them, the spirit and the body to be united never again to be divided, that they might receive a fulness of joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.18'>While this vast multitude waited and conversed, rejoicing in the hour of their deliverance from the chains of death, the Son of God appeared, declaring liberty to the captives who had been faithful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.19'>And there he preached to them the everlasting gospel, the doctrine of the resurrection and the redemption of mankind from the fall, and from individual sins on conditions of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.20'>But unto the wicked he did not go, and among the ungodly and the unrepentant who had defiled themselves while in the flesh, his voice was not raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.21'>Neither did the rebellious who rejected the testimonies and the warnings of the ancient prophets behold his presence, nor look upon his face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.22'>Where these were, darkness reigned, but among the righteous there was peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.23'>And the saints rejoiced in their redemption, and bowed the knee and acknowledged the Son of God as their Redeemer and Deliverer from death and the chains of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.24'>Their countenances shone, and the radiance from the presence of the Lord rested upon them, and they sang praises unto his holy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.25'>I marveled, for I understood that the Savior spent about three years in his ministry among the Jews and those of the house of Israel, endeavoring to teach them the everlasting gospel and call them unto repentance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.26'>And yet, notwithstanding his mighty works, and miracles, and proclamation of the truth, in great power and authority, there were but few who hearkened to his voice, and rejoiced in his presence, and received salvation at his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.27'>But his ministry among those who were dead was limited to the brief time intervening between the crucifixion and his resurrection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.28'>And I wondered at the words of Peter-wherein he said that the Son of God preached unto the spirits in prison, who sometime were disobedient, when once the long-suffering of God waited in the days of Noah-and how it was possible for him to preach to those spirits and perform the necessary labor among them in so short a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.29'>And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened, and I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.30'>But behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces and appointed messengers, clothed with power and authority, and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.31'>And the chosen messengers went forth to declare the acceptable day of the Lord and proclaim liberty to the captives who were bound, even unto all who would repent of their sins and receive the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.32'>Thus was the gospel preached to those who had died in their sins, without a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.33'>These were taught faith in God, repentance from sin, vicarious baptism for the remission of sins, the gift of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.34'>And all other principles of the gospel that were necessary for them to know in order to qualify themselves that they might be judged according to men in the flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.35'>And so it was made known among the dead, both small and great, the unrighteous as well as the faithful, that redemption had been wrought through the sacrifice of the Son of God upon the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.36'>Thus was it made known that our Redeemer spent his time during his sojourn in the world of spirits, instructing and preparing the faithful spirits of the prophets who had testified of him in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.37'>That they might carry the message of redemption unto all the dead, unto whom he could not go personally, because of their rebellion and transgression, that they through the ministration of his servants might also hear his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.38'>Among the great and mighty ones who were assembled in this vast congregation of the righteous were Father Adam, the Ancient of Days and father of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.39'>And our glorious Mother Eve, with many of her faithful daughters who had lived through the ages and worshiped the true and living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.40'>Abel, the first martyr, was there, and his brother Seth, one of the mighty ones, who was in the express image of his father, Adam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.41'>Noah, who gave warning of the flood; Shem, the great high priest; Abraham, the father of the faithful; Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, the great law-giver of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.42'>And Isaiah, who declared by prophecy that the Redeemer was anointed to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the prison to them that were bound, were also there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.43'>Moreover, Ezekiel, who was shown in vision the great valley of dry bones, which were to be clothed upon with flesh, to come forth again in the resurrection of the dead, living souls;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.44'>Daniel, who foresaw and foretold the establishment of the kingdom of God in the latter days, never again to be destroyed nor given to other people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.45'>Elias, who was with Moses on the Mount of Transfiguration;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.46'>And Malachi, the prophet who testified of the coming of Elijah-of whom also Moroni spake to the Prophet Joseph Smith, declaring that he should come before the ushering in of the great and dreadful day of the Lord-were also there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.47'>The Prophet Elijah was to plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to their fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.48'>Foreshadowing the great work to be done in the temples of the Lord in the dispensation of the fulness of times, for the redemption of the dead, and the sealing of the children to their parents, lest the whole earth be smitten with a curse and utterly wasted at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.49'>All these and many more, even the prophets who dwelt among the Nephites and testified of the coming of the Son of God, mingled in the vast assembly and waited for their deliverance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.50'>For the dead had looked upon the long absence of their spirits from their bodies as a bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.51'>These the Lord taught, and gave them power to come forth, after his resurrection from the dead, to enter into his Father's kingdom, there to be crowned with immortality and eternal life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.52'>And continue thenceforth their labor as had been promised by the Lord, and be partakers of all blessings which were held in reserve for them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.53'>The Prophet Joseph Smith, and my father, Hyrum Smith, Brigham Young, John Taylor, Wilford Woodruff, and other choice spirits who were reserved to come forth in the fulness of times to take part in laying the foundations of the great latter-day work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.54'>Including the building of the temples and the performance of ordinances therein for the redemption of the dead, were also in the spirit world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.55'>I observed that they were also among the noble and great ones who were chosen in the beginning to be rulers in the Church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.56'>Even before they were born, they, with many others, received their first lessons in the world of spirits and were prepared to come forth in the due time of the Lord to labor in his vineyard for the salvation of the souls of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.57'>I beheld that the faithful elders of this dispensation, when they depart from mortal life, continue their labors in the preaching of the gospel of repentance and redemption, through the sacrifice of the Only Begotten Son of God, among those who are in darkness and under the bondage of sin in the great world of the spirits of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.58'>The dead who repent will be redeemed, through obedience to the ordinances of the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.59'>And after they have paid the penalty of their transgressions, and are washed clean, shall receive a reward according to their works, for they are heirs of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.60'>Thus was the vision of the redemption of the dead revealed to me, and I bear record, and I know that this record is true, through the blessing of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, even so. Amen.</verse>
