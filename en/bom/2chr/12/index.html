But in the gift of his Son hath God prepared a more excellent way; and it is by faith that it hath been fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>For if there be no faith among the children of men God can do no miracle among them; wherefore, he showed not himself until after their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, it was the faith of Alma and Amulek that caused the prison to tumble to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Behold, it was the faith of Nephi and Lehi that wrought the change upon the Lamanites, that they were baptized with fire and with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, it was the faith of Ammon and his brethren which wrought so great a miracle among the Lamanites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Yea, and even all they who wrought miracles wrought them by faith, even those who were before Christ and also those who were after.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it was by faith that the three disciples obtained a promise that they should not taste of death; and they obtained not the promise until after their faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And neither at any time hath any wrought miracles until after their faith; wherefore they first believed in the Son of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And there were many whose faith was so exceedingly strong, even before Christ came, who could not be kept from within the veil, but truly saw with their eyes the things which they had beheld with an eye of faith, and they were glad.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And behold, we have seen in this record that one of these was the brother of Jared; for so great was his faith in God, that when God put forth his finger he could not hide it from the sight of the brother of Jared, because of his word which he had spoken unto him, which word he had obtained by faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And after the brother of Jared had beheld the finger of the Lord, because of the promise which the brother of Jared had obtained by faith, the Lord could not withhold anything from his sight; wherefore he showed him all things, for he could no longer be kept without the veil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And it is by faith that my fathers have obtained the promise that these things should come unto their brethren through the Gentiles; therefore the Lord hath commanded me, yea, even Jesus Christ.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And I said unto him: Lord, the Gentiles will mock at these things, because of our weakness in writing; for Lord thou hast made us mighty in word by faith, but thou hast not made us mighty in writing; for thou hast made all this people that they could speak much, because of the Holy Ghost which thou hast given them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And thou hast made us that we could write but little, because of the awkwardness of our hands. Behold, thou hast not made us mighty in writing like unto the brother of Jared, for thou madest him that the things which he wrote were mighty even as thou art, unto the overpowering of man to read them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou hast also made our words powerful and great, even that we cannot write them; wherefore, when we write we behold our weakness, and stumble because of the placing of our words; and I fear lest the Gentiles shall mock at our words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when I had said this, the Lord spake unto me, saying: Fools mock, but they shall mourn; and my grace is sufficient for the meek, that they shall take no advantage of your weakness;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble; and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me; for if they humble themselves before me, and have faith in me, then will I make weak things become strong unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Behold, I will show unto the Gentiles their weakness, and I will show unto them that faith, hope and charity bringeth unto me-the fountain of all righteousness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I, Moroni, having heard these words, was comforted, and said: O Lord, thy righteous will be done, for I know that thou workest unto the children of men according to their faith;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For the brother of Jared said unto the mountain Zerin, Remove-and it was removed. And if he had not had faith it would not have moved; wherefore thou workest after men have faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For thus didst thou manifest thyself unto thy disciples; for after they had faith, and did speak in thy name, thou didst show thyself unto them in great power.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And I also remember that thou hast said that thou hast prepared a house for man, yea, even among the mansions of thy Father, in which man might have a more excellent hope; wherefore man must hope, or he cannot receive an inheritance in the place which thou hast prepared.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And again, I remember that thou hast said that thou hast loved the world, even unto the laying down of thy life for the world, that thou mightest take it again to prepare a place for the children of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And now I know that this love which thou hast had for the children of men is charity; wherefore, except men shall have charity they cannot inherit that place which thou hast prepared in the mansions of thy Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Wherefore, I know by this thing which thou hast said, that if the Gentiles have not charity, because of our weakness, that thou wilt prove them, and take away their talent, yea, even that which they have received, and give unto them who shall have more abundantly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And only a few have I written, because of my weakness in writing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
