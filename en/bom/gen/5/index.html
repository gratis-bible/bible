And after this manner of language did she speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks unto the God of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, who were our first parents;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he and his fathers had kept the records.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied many things concerning his seed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
