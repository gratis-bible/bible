        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is God’s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>AND now I, Moroni, proceed to give an account of those ancient inhabitants who were destroyed by the hand of the Lord upon the face of this north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>And I take mine account from the twenty and four plates which were found by the people of Limhi, which is called the Book of Ether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>And as I suppose that the first part of this record, which speaks concerning the creation of the world, and also of Adam, and an account from that time even to the great tower, and whatsoever things transpired among the children of men until that time, is had among the Jews-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>Therefore I do not write those things which transpired from the days of Adam until that time; but they are had upon the plates; and whoso findeth them, the same will have power that he may get the full account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>But behold, I give not the full account, but a part of the account I give, from the tower down until they were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And on this wise do I give the account. He that wrote this record was Ether, and he was a descendant of Coriantor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.34'>And the brother of Jared being a large and mighty man, and a man highly favored of the Lord, Jared, his brother, said unto him: Cry unto the Lord, that he will not confound us that we may not understand our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.35'>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon Jared; therefore he did not confound the language of Jared; and Jared and his brother were not confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.36'>Then Jared said unto his brother: Cry again unto the Lord, and it may be that he will turn away his anger from them who are our friends, that he confound not their language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.37'>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did cry unto the Lord, and the Lord had compassion upon their friends and their families also, that they were not confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.38'>And it came to pass that Jared spake again unto his brother, saying: Go and inquire of the Lord whether he will drive us out of the land, and if he will drive us out of the land, cry unto him whither we shall go. And who knoweth but the Lord will carry us forth into a land which is choice above all the earth? And if it so be, let us be faithful unto the Lord, that we may receive it for our inheritance.</verse>

And thus I will do unto thee because this long time ye have cried unto me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>AND it came to pass that Jared and his brother, and their families, and also the friends of Jared and his brother and their families, went down into the valley which was northward, (and the name of the valley was Nimrod, being called after the mighty hunter) with their flocks which they had gathered together, male and female, of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And they did also lay snares and catch fowls of the air; and they did also prepare a vessel, in which they did carry with them the fish of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And they did also carry with them deseret, which, by interpretation, is a honey bee; and thus they did carry with them swarms of bees, and all manner of that which was upon the face of the land, seeds of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>And it came to pass that when they had come down into the valley of Nimrod the Lord came down and talked with the brother of Jared; and he was in a cloud, and the brother of Jared saw him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded them that they should go forth into the wilderness, yea, into that quarter where there never had man been. And it came to pass that the Lord did go before them, and did talk with them as he stood in a cloud, and gave directions whither they should travel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>And it came to pass that they did travel in the wilderness, and did build barges, in which they did cross many waters, being directed continually by the hand of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>And the Lord would not suffer that they should stop beyond the sea in the wilderness, but he would that they should come forth even unto the land of promise, which was choice above all other lands, which the Lord God had preserved for a righteous people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>And he had sworn in his wrath unto the brother of Jared, that whoso should possess this land of promise, from that time henceforth and forever, should serve him, the true and only God, or they should be swept off when the fulness of his wrath should come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>And now, we can behold the decrees of God concerning this land, that it is a land of promise; and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall serve God, or they shall be swept off when the fulness of his wrath shall come upon them. And the fulness of his wrath cometh upon them when they are ripened in iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>For behold, this is a land which is choice above all other lands; wherefore he that doth possess it shall serve God or shall be swept off; for it is the everlasting decree of God. And it is not until the fulness of iniquity among the children of the land, that they are swept off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>And this cometh unto you, O ye Gentiles, that ye may know the decrees of God-that ye may repent, and not continue in your iniquities until the fulness come, that ye may not bring down the fulness of the wrath of God upon you as the inhabitants of the land have hitherto done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>Behold, this is a choice land, and whatsoever nation shall possess it shall be free from bondage, and from captivity, and from all other nations under heaven, if they will but serve the God of the land, who is Jesus Christ, who hath been manifested by the things which we have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>And now I proceed with my record; for behold, it came to pass that the Lord did bring Jared and his brethren forth even to that great sea which divideth the lands. And as they came to the sea they pitched their tents; and they called the name of the place Moriancumer; and they dwelt in tents, and dwelt in tents upon the seashore for the space of four years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>And it came to pass at the end of four years that the Lord came again unto the brother of Jared, and stood in a cloud and talked with him. And for the space of three hours did the Lord talk with the brother of Jared, and chastened him because he remembered not to call upon the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>And the brother of Jared repented of the evil which he had done, and did call upon the name of the Lord for his brethren who were with him. And the Lord said unto him: I will forgive thee and thy brethren of their sins; but thou shalt not sin any more, for ye shall remember that my Spirit will not always strive with man; wherefore, if ye will sin until ye are fully ripe ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And these are my thoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it shall be a land choice above all other lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built. And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and built barges after the manner which they had built, according to the instructions of the Lord. And they were small, and they were light upon the water, even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>And they were built after a manner that they were exceedingly tight, even that they would hold water like unto a dish; and the bottom thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the sides thereof were tight like unto a dish; and the ends thereof were peaked; and the top thereof was tight like unto a dish; and the length thereof was the length of a tree; and the door thereof, when it was shut, was tight like unto a dish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast commanded me, and I have made the barges according as thou hast directed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.19'>And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light; whither shall we steer? And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore we shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.20'>And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air. And if it be so that the water come in upon thee, behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.21'>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did so, according as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.22'>And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.23'>And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go by the light of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.24'>For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the floods have I sent forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.25'>And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>AND it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto the mount, which they called the mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity, and hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this thy people, and suffer not that they shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness; but behold these things which I have molten out of the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to show forth great power, which looks small unto the understanding of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger. And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the earth; and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And he answered: Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the words which I shall speak?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord showed himself unto him, and said: Because thou knowest these things ye are redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my presence; therefore I show myself unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And now, as I, Moroni, said I could not make a full account of these things which are written, therefore it sufficeth me to say that Jesus showed himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the manner and in the likeness of the same body even as he showed himself unto the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.18'>And he ministered unto him even as he ministered unto the Nephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God, because of the many great works which the Lord had showed unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.19'>And because of the knowledge of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the veil; and he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had faith no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.20'>Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could not be kept from within the veil; therefore he saw Jesus; and he did minister unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.21'>And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer these things which ye have seen and heard to go forth unto the world, until the time cometh that I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall treasure up the things which ye have seen and heard, and show it to no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.22'>And behold, when ye shall come unto me, ye shall write them and shall seal them up, that no one can interpret them; for ye shall write them in a language that they cannot be read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.23'>And behold, these two stones will I give unto thee, and ye shall seal them up also with the things which ye shall write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.24'>For behold, the language which ye shall write I have confounded; wherefore I will cause in my own due time that these stones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye shall write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.25'>And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.26'>For he had said unto him in times before, that if he would believe in him that he could show unto him all things-it should be shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything from him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.27'>And the Lord said unto him: Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.28'>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he should seal up the two stones which he had received, and show them not, until the Lord should show them unto the children of men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>AND the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the mount from the presence of the Lord, and write the things which he had seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the children of men until after that he should be lifted up upon the cross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that they should not come unto the world until after Christ should show himself unto his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people he commanded that they should be made manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And now, after that, they have all dwindled in unbelief; and there is none save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected the gospel of Christ; therefore I am commanded that I should hide them up again in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>Behold, I have written upon these plates the very things which the brother of Jared saw; and there never were greater things made manifest than those which were made manifest unto the brother of Jared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I have written them. And he commanded me that I should seal them up; and he also hath commanded that I should seal up the interpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the interpreters, according to the commandment of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>For the Lord said unto me: They shall not go forth unto the Gentiles until the day that they shall repent of their iniquity, and become clean before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith the Lord, even as the brother of Jared did, that they may become sanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them the things which the brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations, saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of the heavens and of the earth, and all things that in them are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>And he that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him be accursed; and he that shall deny these things, let him be accursed; for unto them will I show no greater things, saith Jesus Christ; for I am he who speaketh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>And at my command the heavens are opened and are shut; and at my word the earth shall shake; and at my command the inhabitants thereof shall pass away, even so as by fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>AND now I, Moroni, proceed to give the record of Jared and his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the stones which the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the brother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth the stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end thereof; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And thus the Lord caused stones to shine in darkness, to give light unto men, women, and children, that they might not cross the great waters in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of food, that thereby they might subsist upon the water, and also food for their flocks and herds, and whatsoever beast or animal or fowl that they should carry with them-and it came to pass that when they had done all these things they got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should be a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the promised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the depths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon them, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land while they were upon the waters; and thus they were driven forth before the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and praise the Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not cease to praise the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>And thus they were driven forth; and no monster of the sea could break them, neither whale that could mar them; and they did have light continually, whether it was above the water or under the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And thus they were driven forth, three hundred and forty and four days upon the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And they did land upon the shore of the promised land. And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>And it came to pass that they went forth upon the face of the land, and began to till the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>And Jared had four sons; and they were called Jacom, and Gilgah, and Mahah, and Orihah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he must soon go down to the grave; wherefore he said unto Jared: Let us gather together our people that we may number them, that we may know of them what they will desire of us before we go down to our graves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>And accordingly the people were gathered together. Now the number of the sons and the daughters of the brother of Jared were twenty and two souls; and the number of sons and daughters of Jared were twelve, he having four sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>And it came to pass that they did number their people; and after that they had numbered them, they did desire of them the things which they would that they should do before they went down to their graves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.24'>But Jared said unto his brother: Suffer them that they may have a king. And therefore he said unto them: Choose ye out from among our sons a king, even whom ye will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.25'>And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the brother of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and would not be their king. And the people would that his father should constrain him, but his father would not; and he commanded them that they should constrain no man to be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.26'>And it came to pass that they chose all the brothers of Pagag, and they would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.27'>And it came to pass that neither would the sons of Jared, even all save it were one; and Orihah was anointed to be king over the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.28'>And he began to reign, and the people began to prosper; and they became exceedingly rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.29'>And it came to pass that Jared died, and his brother also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.30'>And it came to pass that Orihah did walk humbly before the Lord, and did remember how great things the Lord had done for his father, and also taught his people how great things the Lord had done for their fathers.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.1'>AND it came to pass that Orihah did execute judgment upon the land in righteousness all his days, whose days were exceedingly many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.2'>And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he begat thirty and one, among whom were twenty and three sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.3'>And it came to pass that he also begat Kib in his old age. And it came to pass that Kib reigned in his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.4'>And when Corihor was thirty and two years old he rebelled against his father, and went over and dwelt in the land of Nehor; and he begat sons and daughters, and they became exceedingly fair; wherefore Corihor drew away many people after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.5'>And when he had gathered together an army he came up unto the land of Moron where the king dwelt, and took him captive, which brought to pass the saying of the brother of Jared that they would be brought into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.6'>Now the land of Moron, where the king dwelt, was near the land which is called Desolation by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.7'>And it came to pass that Kib dwelt in captivity, and his people under Corihor his son, until he became exceedingly old; nevertheless Kib begat Shule in his old age, while he was yet in captivity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.9'>Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did molten out of the hill, and made swords out of steel for those whom he had drawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he returned to the city Nehor, and gave battle unto his brother Corihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom and restored it unto his father Kib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.10'>And now because of the thing which Shule had done, his father bestowed upon him the kingdom; therefore he began to reign in the stead of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.11'>And it came to pass that he did execute judgment in righteousness; and he did spread his kingdom upon all the face of the land, for the people had become exceedingly numerous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.12'>And it came to pass that Shule also begat many sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.13'>And Corihor repented of the many evils which he had done; wherefore Shule gave him power in his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.14'>And it came to pass that Corihor had many sons and daughters. And among the sons of Corihor there was one whose name was Noah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.15'>And it came to pass that Noah rebelled against Shule, the king, and also his father Corihor, and drew away Cohor his brother, and also all his brethren and many of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.16'>And he gave battle unto Shule, the king, in which he did obtain the land of their first inheritance; and he became a king over that part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.17'>And it came to pass that he gave battle again unto Shule, the king; and he took Shule, the king, and carried him away captive into Moron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.18'>And it came to pass as he was about to put him to death, the sons of Shule crept into the house of Noah by night and slew him, and broke down the door of the prison and brought out their father, and placed him upon his throne in his own kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.19'>Wherefore, the son of Noah did build up his kingdom in his stead; nevertheless they did not gain power any more over Shule the king, and the people who were under the reign of Shule the king did prosper exceedingly and wax great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.20'>And the country was divided; and there were two kingdoms, the kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom of Cohor, the son of Noah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.21'>And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his people should give battle unto Shule, in which Shule did beat them and did slay Cohor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.22'>And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in the eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon him, and he did do in the kingdom of Shule according to his desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.23'>And also in the reign of Shule there came prophets among the people, who were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the wickedness and idolatry of the people was bringing a curse upon the land, and they should be destroyed if they did not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.24'>And it came to pass that the people did revile against the prophets, and did mock them. And it came to pass that king Shule did execute judgment against all those who did revile against the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.25'>And he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave power unto the prophets that they should go whithersoever they would; and by this cause the people were brought unto repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.26'>And because the people did repent of their iniquities and idolatries the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper again in the land. And it came to pass that Shule begat sons and daughters in his old age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.27'>And there were no more wars in the days of Shule; and he remembered the great things that the Lord had done for his fathers in bringing them across the great deep into the promised land; wherefore he did execute judgment in righteousness all his days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.8'>Now the daughter of Jared being exceedingly expert, and seeing the sorrows of her father, thought to devise a plan whereby she could redeem the kingdom unto her father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.9'>Now the daughter of Jared was exceedingly fair. And it came to pass that she did talk with her father, and said unto him: Whereby hath my father so much sorrow? Hath he not read the record which our fathers brought across the great deep? Behold, is there not an account concerning them of old, that they by their secret plans did obtain kingdoms and great glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.10'>And now, therefore, let my father send for Akish, the son of Kimnor; and behold, I am fair, and I will dance before him, and I will please him, that he will desire me to wife; wherefore if he shall desire of thee that ye shall give unto him me to wife, then shall ye say: I will give her if ye will bring unto me the head of my father, the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.11'>And now Omer was a friend to Akish; wherefore, when Jared had sent for Akish, the daughter of Jared danced before him that she pleased him, insomuch that he desired her to wife. And it came to pass that he said unto Jared: Give her unto me to wife.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.37'>And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore, thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.38'>And now I, Moroni, bid farewell unto the Gentiles, yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.39'>And then shall ye know that I have seen Jesus, and that he hath talked with me face to face, and that he told me in plain humility, even as a man telleth another in mine own language, concerning these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.40'>And only a few have I written, because of my weakness in writing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.41'>And now, I would commend you to seek this Jesus of whom the prophets and apostles have written, that the grace of God the Father, and also the Lord Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of them, may be and abide in you forever. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.1'>AND now I, Moroni, proceed to finish my record concerning the destruction of the people of whom I have been writing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.2'>For behold, they rejected all the words of Ether; for he truly told them of all things, from the beginning of man; and that after the waters had receded from off the face of this land it became a choice land above all other lands, a chosen land of the Lord; wherefore the Lord would have that all men should serve him who dwell upon the face thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.3'>And that it was the place of the New Jerusalem, which should come down out of heaven, and the holy sanctuary of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.4'>Behold, Ether saw the days of Christ, and he spake concerning a New Jerusalem upon this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.5'>And he spake also concerning the house of Israel, and the Jerusalem from whence Lehi should come-after it should be destroyed it should be built up again, a holy city unto the Lord; wherefore, it could not be a new Jerusalem for it had been in a time of old; but it should be built up again, and become a holy city of the Lord; and it should be built unto the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.6'>And that a New Jerusalem should be built up upon this land, unto the remnant of the seed of Joseph, for which things there has been a type.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.7'>For as Joseph brought his father down into the land of Egypt, even so he died there; wherefore, the Lord brought a remnant of the seed of Joseph out of the land of Jerusalem, that he might be merciful unto the seed of Joseph that they should perish not, even as he was merciful unto the father of Joseph that he should perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.8'>Wherefore, the remnant of the house of Joseph shall be built upon this land; and it shall be a land of their inheritance; and they shall build up a holy city unto the Lord, like unto the Jerusalem of old; and they shall no more be confounded, until the end come when the earth shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.9'>And there shall be a new heaven and a new earth; and they shall be like unto the old save the old have passed away, and all things have become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.10'>And then cometh the New Jerusalem; and blessed are they who dwell therein, for it is they whose garments are white through the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who are numbered among the remnant of the seed of Joseph, who were of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.11'>And then also cometh the Jerusalem of old; and the inhabitants thereof, blessed are they, for they have been washed in the blood of the Lamb; and they are they who were scattered and gathered in from the four quarters of the earth, and from the north countries, and are partakers of the fulfilling of the covenant which God made with their father, Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.12'>And when these things come, bringeth to pass the scripture which saith, there are they who were first, who shall be last; and there are they who were last, who shall be first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.13'>And I was about to write more, but I am forbidden; but great and marvelous were the prophecies of Ether; but they esteemed him as naught, and cast him out; and he hid himself in the cavity of a rock by day, and by night he went forth viewing the things which should come upon the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.14'>And as he dwelt in the cavity of a rock he made the remainder of this record, viewing the destructions which came upon the people, by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.15'>And it came to pass that in that same year in which he was cast out from among the people there began to be a great war among the people, for there were many who rose up, who were mighty men, and sought to destroy Coriantumr by their secret plans of wickedness, of which hath been spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.16'>And now Coriantumr, having studied, himself, in all the arts of war and all the cunning of the world, wherefore he gave battle unto them who sought to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.17'>But he repented not, neither his fair sons nor daughters; neither the fair sons and daughters of Cohor; neither the fair sons and daughters of Corihor; and in fine, there were none of the fair sons and daughters upon the face of the whole earth who repented of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.18'>Wherefore, it came to pass that in the first year that Ether dwelt in the cavity of a rock, there were many people who were slain by the sword of those secret combinations, fighting against Coriantumr that they might obtain the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.19'>And it came to pass that the sons of Coriantumr fought much and bled much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.20'>And in the second year the word of the Lord came to Ether, that he should go and prophesy unto Coriantumr that, if he would repent, and all his household, the Lord would give unto him his kingdom and spare the people-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.21'>Otherwise they should be destroyed, and all his household save it were himself. And he should only live to see the fulfilling of the prophecies which had been spoken concerning another people receiving the land for their inheritance; and Coriantumr should receive a burial by them; and every soul should be destroyed save it were Coriantumr.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.22'>And it came to pass that Coriantumr repented not, neither his household, neither the people; and the wars ceased not; and they sought to kill Ether, but he fled from before them and hid again in the cavity of the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.23'>And it came to pass that there arose up Shared, and he also gave battle unto Coriantumr; and he did beat him, insomuch that in the third year he did bring him into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.24'>And the sons of Coriantumr, in the fourth year, did beat Shared, and did obtain the kingdom again unto their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.25'>Now there began to be a war upon all the face of the land, every man with his band fighting for that which he desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.26'>And there were robbers, and in fine, all manner of wickedness upon all the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.27'>And it came to pass that Coriantumr was exceedingly angry with Shared, and he went against him with his armies to battle; and they did meet in great anger, and they did meet in the valley of Gilgal; and the battle became exceedingly sore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.28'>And it came to pass that Shared fought against him for the space of three days. And it came to pass that Coriantumr beat him, and did pursue him until he came to the plains of Heshlon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.29'>And it came to pass that Shared gave him battle again upon the plains; and behold, he did beat Coriantumr, and drove him back again to the valley of Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.30'>And Coriantumr gave Shared battle again in the valley of Gilgal, in which he beat Shared and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.31'>And Shared wounded Coriantumr in his thigh, that he did not go to battle again for the space of two years, in which time all the people upon the face of the land were shedding blood, and there was none to restrain them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.1'>AND now there began to be a great curse upon all the land because of the iniquity of the people, in which, if a man should lay his tool or his sword upon his shelf, or upon the place whither he would keep it, behold, upon the morrow, he could not find it, so great was the curse upon the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.2'>Wherefore every man did cleave unto that which was his own, with his hands, and would not borrow neither would he lend; and every man kept the hilt of his sword in his right hand, in the defence of his property and his own life and of his wives and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.3'>And now, after the space of two years, and after the death of Shared, behold, there arose the brother of Shared and he gave battle unto Coriantumr, in which Coriantumr did beat him and did pursue him to the wilderness of Akish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.4'>And it came to pass that the brother of Shared did give battle unto him in the wilderness of Akish; and the battle became exceedingly sore, and many thousands fell by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.5'>And it came to pass that Coriantumr did lay siege to the wilderness; and the brother of Shared did march forth out of the wilderness by night, and slew a part of the army of Coriantumr, as they were drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.6'>And he came forth to the land of Moron, and placed himself upon the throne of Coriantumr.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.7'>And it came to pass that Coriantumr dwelt with his army in the wilderness for the space of two years, in which he did receive great strength to his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>Now the brother of Shared, whose name was Gilead, also received great strength to his army, because of secret combinations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.9'>And it came to pass that his high priest murdered him as he sat upon his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.10'>And it came to pass that one of the secret combinations murdered him in a secret pass, and obtained unto himself the kingdom; and his name was Lib; and Lib was a man of great stature, more than any other man among all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.11'>And it came to pass that in the first year of Lib, Coriantumr came up unto the land of Moron, and gave battle unto Lib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.12'>And it came to pass that he fought with Lib, in which Lib did smite upon his arm that he was wounded; nevertheless, the army of Coriantumr did press forward upon Lib, that he fled to the borders upon the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.13'>And it came to pass that Coriantumr pursued him; and Lib gave battle unto him upon the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.14'>And it came to pass that Lib did smite the army of Coriantumr, that they fled again to the wilderness of Akish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.15'>And it came to pass that Lib did pursue him until he came to the plains of Agosh. And Coriantumr had taken all the people with him as he fled before Lib in that quarter of the land whither he fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.16'>And when he had come to the plains of Agosh he gave battle unto Lib, and he smote upon him until he died; nevertheless, the brother of Lib did come against Coriantumr in the stead thereof, and the battle became exceedingly sore, in the which Coriantumr fled again before the army of the brother of Lib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.17'>Now the name of the brother of Lib was called Shiz. And it came to pass that Shiz pursued after Coriantumr, and he did overthrow many cities, and he did slay both women and children, and he did burn the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.18'>And there went a fear of Shiz throughout all the land; yea, a cry went forth throughout the land-Who can stand before the army of Shiz? Behold, he sweepeth the earth before him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.19'>And it came to pass that the people began to flock together in armies, throughout all the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.20'>And they were divided; and a part of them fled to the army of Shiz, and a part of them fled to the army of Coriantumr.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.21'>And so great and lasting had been the war, and so long had been the scene of bloodshed and carnage, that the whole face of the land was covered with the bodies of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.22'>And so swift and speedy was the war that there was none left to bury the dead, but they did march forth from the shedding of blood to the shedding of blood, leaving the bodies of both men, women, and children strewed upon the face of the land, to become a prey to the worms of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.23'>And the scent thereof went forth upon the face of the land, even upon all the face of the land; wherefore the people became troubled by day and by night, because of the scent thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.24'>Nevertheless, Shiz did not cease to pursue Coriantumr; for he had sworn to avenge himself upon Coriantumr of the blood of his brother, who had been slain, and the word of the Lord which came to Ether that Coriantumr should not fall by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.25'>And thus we see that the Lord did visit them in the fulness of his wrath, and their wickedness and abominations had prepared a way for their everlasting destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.26'>And it came to pass that Shiz did pursue Coriantumr eastward, even to the borders by the seashore, and there he gave battle unto Shiz for the space of three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.27'>And so terrible was the destruction among the armies of Shiz that the people began to be frightened, and began to flee before the armies of Coriantumr; and they fled to the land of Corihor, and swept off the inhabitants before them, all them that would not join them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.28'>And they pitched their tents in the valley of Corihor; and Coriantumr pitched his tents in the valley of Shurr. Now the valley of Shurr was near the hill Comnor; wherefore, Coriantumr did gather his armies together upon the hill Comnor, and did sound a trumpet unto the armies of Shiz to invite them forth to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.29'>And it came to pass that they came forth, but were driven again; and they came the second time, and they were driven again the second time. And it came to pass that they came again the third time, and the battle became exceedingly sore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.30'>And it came to pass that Shiz smote upon Coriantumr that he gave him many deep wounds; and Coriantumr, having lost his blood, fainted, and was carried away as though he were dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.31'>Now the loss of men, women and children on both sides was so great that Shiz commanded his people that they should not pursue the armies of Coriantumr; wherefore, they returned to their camp.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.15'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.1'>AND it came to pass when Coriantumr had recovered of his wounds, he began to remember the words which Ether had spoken unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.2'>He saw that there had been slain by the sword already nearly two millions of his people, and he began to sorrow in his heart; yea, there had been slain two millions of mighty men, and also their wives and their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.3'>He began to repent of the evil which he had done; he began to remember the words which had been spoken by the mouth of all the prophets, and he saw them that they were fulfilled thus far, every whit; and his soul mourned and refused to be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.4'>And it came to pass that he wrote an epistle unto Shiz, desiring him that he would spare the people, and he would give up the kingdom for the sake of the lives of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.5'>And it came to pass that when Shiz had received his epistle he wrote an epistle unto Coriantumr, that if he would give himself up, that he might slay him with his own sword, that he would spare the lives of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.6'>And it came to pass that the people repented not of their iniquity; and the people of Coriantumr were stirred up to anger against the people of Shiz; and the people of Shiz were stirred up to anger against the people of Coriantumr; wherefore, the people of Shiz did give battle unto the people of Coriantumr.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.7'>And when Coriantumr saw that he was about to fall he fled again before the people of Shiz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.8'>And it came to pass that he came to the waters of Ripliancum, which, by interpretation, is large, or to exceed all; wherefore, when they came to these waters they pitched their tents; and Shiz also pitched his tents near unto them; and therefore on the morrow they did come to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.9'>And it came to pass that they fought an exceedingly sore battle, in which Coriantumr was wounded again, and he fainted with the loss of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.10'>And it came to pass that the armies of Coriantumr did press upon the armies of Shiz that they beat them, that they caused them to flee before them; and they did flee southward, and did pitch their tents in a place which was called Ogath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.11'>And it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr did pitch their tents by the hill Ramah; and it was that same hill where my father Mormon did hide up the records unto the Lord, which were sacred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.12'>And it came to pass that they did gather together all the people upon all the face of the land, who had not been slain, save it was Ether.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.13'>And it came to pass that Ether did behold all the doings of the people; and he beheld that the people who were for Coriantumr were gathered together to the army of Coriantumr; and the people who were for Shiz were gathered together to the army of Shiz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.14'>Wherefore, they were for the space of four years gathering together the people, that they might get all who were upon the face of the land, and that they might receive all the strength which it was possible that they could receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.15'>And it came to pass that when they were all gathered together, every one to the army which he would, with their wives and their children-both men, women and children being armed with weapons of war, having shields, and breastplates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner of war-they did march forth one against another to battle; and they fought all that day, and conquered not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.16'>And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and after they had retired to their camps they took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that they did rend the air exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.17'>And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to battle, and great and terrible was that day; nevertheless, they conquered not, and when the night came again they did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.18'>And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but that he would take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.19'>But behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and Satan had full power over the hearts of the people; for they were given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.20'>And it came to pass that they fought all that day, and when the night came they slept upon their swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.21'>And on the morrow they fought even until the night came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.22'>And when the night came they were drunken with anger, even as a man who is drunken with wine; and they slept again upon their swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.23'>And on the morrow they fought again; and when the night came they had all fallen by the sword save it were fifty and two of the people of Coriantumr, and sixty and nine of the people of Shiz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.24'>And it came to pass that they slept upon their swords that night, and on the morrow they fought again, and they contended in their might with their swords and with their shields, all that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.25'>And when the night came there were thirty and two of the people of Shiz, and twenty and seven of the people of Coriantumr.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.26'>And it came to pass that they ate and slept, and prepared for death on the morrow. And they were large and mighty men as to the strength of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.27'>And it came to pass that they fought for the space of three hours, and they fainted with the loss of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.28'>And it came to pass that when the men of Coriantumr had received sufficient strength that they could walk, they were about to flee for their lives; but behold, Shiz arose, and also his men, and he swore in his wrath that he would slay Coriantumr or he would perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.29'>Wherefore, he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did overtake them; and they fought again with the sword. And it came to pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were Coriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with the loss of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.30'>And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his sword, that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.31'>And it came to pass that after he had smitten off the head of Shiz, that Shiz raised up on his hands and fell; and after that he had struggled for breath, he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.32'>And it came to pass that Coriantumr fell to the earth, and became as if he had no life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.33'>And the Lord spake unto Ether, and said unto him: Go forth. And he went forth, and beheld that the words of the Lord had all been fulfilled; and he finished his record; (and the hundredth part I have not written) and he hid them in a manner that the people of Limhi did find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.34'>Now the last words which are written by Ether are these: Whether the Lord will that I be translated, or that I suffer the will of the Lord in the flesh, it mattereth not, if it so be that I am saved in the kingdom of God. Amen.</verse>
