        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is God’s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

        <title>filler fehlt/missing</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noon-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book, and bade him that he should read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read concerning Jerusalem-that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the record of my father then will I make an account of mine own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>FOR behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness.{600 B.C.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a river of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And it came to pass that he called the name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near the mouth thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of all righteousness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many things against their father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And they were like unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did shake before him. And he did confound them, that they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And my father dwelt in a tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he believed in my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, I will curse them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>AND it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast not murmured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And we cast lots-who of us should go in unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as he sat in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out from his presence; and he would not that he should have the records. Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father's inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this he hath done because of the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets. Wherefore, if my father should dwell in the land after he hath been commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also perish. Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather together our gold, and our silver, and our precious things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>And after we had gathered these things together, we went up again unto the house of Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.25'>And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.26'>And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands of Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.27'>And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.28'>And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.29'>And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.30'>And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.31'>And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>AND it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves without the walls. And after they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was drunken with wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands for this cause-that I might obtain the records according to his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And after I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea, even every whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the servant of Laban who had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he should go with me into the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the garments and also the sword girded about my loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And he spake unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he knowing that his master, Laban, had been out by night among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings, which were upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, who were without the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And I also bade him that he should follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.27'>And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I went forth unto my brethren, who were without the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.28'>And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my presence; for they supposed it was Laban, and that he had slain me and had sought to take away their lives also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.29'>And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.30'>And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my brethren he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before me and return to the city of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.31'>And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the servant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.32'>And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so that if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.33'>And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not fear; that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go down in the wilderness with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.34'>And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath commanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.35'>And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he promised that he would go down into the wilderness unto our father. Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us from that time forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.36'>Now we were desirous that he should tarry with us for this cause, that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into the wilderness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>AND it came to pass that after we had come down into the wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.2'>For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.3'>And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.4'>And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying: I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.5'>But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.6'>And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.7'>And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold their joy was full, and my mother was comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.8'>And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.9'>And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks unto the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.10'>And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.11'>And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, who were our first parents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.12'>And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.13'>And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.14'>And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.15'>And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.16'>And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he and his fathers had kept the records.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.17'>And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.18'>That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.19'>Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied many things concerning his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.20'>And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.21'>And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.6.2'>For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.2'>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi, and my brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem, and bring down Ishmael and his family into the wilderness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.7'>And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they were desirous to return unto the land of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.8'>And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, therefore I spake unto them, saying, yea, even unto Laman and unto Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it that ye are so hard in your hearts, and so blind in your minds, that ye have need that I, your younger brother, should speak unto you, yea, and set an example for you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.13'>And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain the land of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that the word of the Lord shall be fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.14'>For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have they cast into prison.

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.17'>But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which I am bound.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.10.12'>Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and also concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared like unto an olive-tree, whose branches should be broken off and should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.15.18'>Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.19'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them concerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the restoration of the Jews in the latter days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.15.25'>Wherefore, I, Nephi, did exhort them to give heed unto the word of the Lord; yea, I did exhort them with all the energies of my soul, and with all the faculty which I possessed, that they would give heed to the word of God and remember to keep his commandments always in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.26'>And they said unto me: What meaneth the river of water which our father saw?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.15.34'>But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.16.15'>And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many days, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and our stones and our slings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.16.19'>And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families, and being much fatigued, because of their journeying, they did suffer much for the want of food.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.16.24'>And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they had humbled themselves because of my words; for I did say many things unto them in the energy of my soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.25'>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.26'>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.27'>And it came to pass that when my father beheld the things which were written upon the ball, he did fear and tremble exceedingly, and also my brethren and the sons of Ishmael and our wives.</verse>

And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.30'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given upon the ball.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.16.33'>And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, traveling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after we had traveled for the space of many days we did pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for the space of a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.34'>And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the place which was called Nahom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.35'>And it came to pass that the daughters of Ishmael did mourn exceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because of their afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against my father, because he had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings we must perish in the wilderness with hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.36'>And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against me; and they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.37'>And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who has taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.38'>Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that angels have ministered unto him. But behold, we know that he lies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make himself a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his will and pleasure. And after this manner did my brother Laman stir up their hearts to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.39'>And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did chasten them exceedingly; and after they were chastened by the voice of the Lord they did turn away their anger, and did repent of their sins, insomuch that the Lord did bless us again with food, that we did not perish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.20.5'>And I have even from the beginning declared to thee; before it came to pass I showed them thee; and I showed them for fear lest thou shouldst say-Mine idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image hath commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.6'>Thou hast seen and heard all this; and will ye not declare them? And that I have showed thee new things from this time, even hidden things, and thou didst not know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.7'>They are created now, and not from the beginning, even before the day when thou heardest them not they were declared unto thee, lest thou shouldst say-Behold I knew them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.8'>Yea, and thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that time thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldst deal very treacherously, and wast called a transgressor from the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.9'>Nevertheless, for my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise will I refrain from thee, that I cut thee not off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.10'>For, behold, I have refined thee, I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.11'>For mine own sake, yea, for mine own sake will I do this, for I will not suffer my name to be polluted, and I will not give my glory unto another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.12'>Hearken unto me, O Jacob, and Israel my called, for I am he; I am the first, and I am also the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.13'>Mine hand hath also laid the foundation of the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens. I call unto them and they stand up together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.14'>All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; who among them hath declared these things unto them? The Lord hath loved him; yea, and he will fulfil his word which he hath declared by them; and he will do his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall come upon the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.15'>Also, saith the Lord; I the Lord, yea, I have spoken; yea, I have called him to declare, I have brought him, and he shall make his way prosperous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.16'>Come ye near unto me; I have not spoken in secret; from the beginning, from the time that it was declared have I spoken; and the Lord God, and his Spirit, hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.17'>And thus saith the Lord, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I have sent him, the Lord thy God who teacheth thee to profit, who leadeth thee by the way thou shouldst go, hath done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.18'>O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments-then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.19'>Thy seed also had been as the sand; the offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.20'>Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter to the end of the earth; say ye: The Lord hath redeemed his servant Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.21'>And they thirsted not; he led them through the deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them; he clave the rock also and the waters gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.20.22'>And notwithstanding he hath done all this, and greater also, there is no peace, saith the Lord, unto the wicked.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.22'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.1'>AND now it came to pass that after I, Nephi, had read these things which were engraven upon the plates of brass, my brethren came unto me and said unto me: What meaneth these things which ye have read? Behold, are they to be understood according to things which are spiritual, which shall come to pass according to the spirit and not the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.2'>And I, Nephi, said unto them: Behold they were manifest unto the prophet by the voice of the Spirit; for by the Spirit are all things made known unto the prophets, which shall come upon the children of men according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.3'>Wherefore, the things of which I have read are things pertaining to things both temporal and spiritual; for it appears that the house of Israel, sooner or later, will be scattered upon all the face of the earth, and also among all nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.4'>And behold, there are many who are already lost from the knowledge of those who are at Jerusalem. Yea, the more part of all the tribes have been led away; and they are scattered to and fro upon the isles of the sea; and whither they are none of us knoweth, save that we know that they have been led away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.5'>And since they have been led away, these things have been prophesied concerning them, and also concerning all those who shall hereafter be scattered and be confounded, because of the Holy One of Israel; for against him will they harden their hearts; wherefore, they shall be scattered among all nations and shall be hated of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.6'>Nevertheless, after they shall be nursed by the Gentiles, and the Lord has lifted up his hand upon the Gentiles and set them up for a standard, and their children have been carried in their arms, and their daughters have been carried upon their shoulders, behold these things of which are spoken are temporal; for thus are the covenants of the Lord with our fathers; and it meaneth us in the days to come, and also all our brethren who are of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.7'>And it meaneth that the time cometh that after all the house of Israel have been scattered and confounded, that the Lord God will raise up a mighty nation among the Gentiles, yea, even upon the face of this land; and by them shall our seed be scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.8'>And after our seed is scattered the Lord God will proceed to do a marvelous work among the Gentiles, which shall be of great worth unto our seed; wherefore, it is likened unto their being nourished by the Gentiles and being carried in their arms and upon their shoulders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.9'>And it shall also be of worth unto the Gentiles; and not only unto the Gentiles but unto all the house of Israel, unto the making known of the covenants of the Father of heaven unto Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.10'>And I would, my brethren, that ye should know that all the kindreds of the earth cannot be blessed unless he shall make bare his arm in the eyes of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.11'>Wherefore, the Lord God will proceed to make bare his arm in the eyes of all the nations, in bringing about his covenants and his gospel unto those who are of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.12'>Wherefore, he will bring them again out of captivity, and they shall be gathered together to the lands of their inheritance; and they shall be brought out of obscurity and out of darkness; and they shall know that the Lord is their Savior and their Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.13'>And the blood of that great and abominable church, which is the whore of all the earth, shall turn upon their own heads; for they shall war among themselves, and the sword of their own hands shall fall upon their own heads, and they shall be drunken with their own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.14'>And every nation which shall war against thee, O house of Israel, shall be turned one against another, and they shall fall into the pit which they digged to ensnare the people of the Lord. And all that fight against Zion shall be destroyed, and that great whore, who hath perverted the right ways of the Lord, yea, that great and abominable church, shall tumble to the dust and great shall be the fall of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.15'>For behold, saith the prophet, the time cometh speedily that Satan shall have no more power over the hearts of the children of men; for the day soon cometh that all the proud and they who do wickedly shall be as stubble; and the day cometh that they must be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.16'>For the time soon cometh that the fulness of the wrath of God shall be poured out upon all the children of men; for he will not suffer that the wicked shall destroy the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.17'>Wherefore, he will preserve the righteous by his power, even if it so be that the fulness of his wrath must come, and the righteous be preserved, even unto the destruction of their enemies by fire. Wherefore, the righteous need not fear; for thus saith the prophet, they shall be saved, even if it so be as by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.18'>Behold, my brethren, I say unto you, that these things must shortly come; yea, even blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke must come; and it must needs be upon the face of this earth; and it cometh unto men according to the flesh if it so be that they will harden their hearts against the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.19'>For behold, the righteous shall not perish; for the time surely must come that all they who fight against Zion shall be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.20'>And the Lord will surely prepare a way for his people, unto the fulfilling of the words of Moses, which he spake, saying: A prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you. And it shall come to pass that all those who will not hear that prophet shall be cut off from among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.21'>And now I, Nephi, declare unto you, that this prophet of whom Moses spake was the Holy One of Israel; wherefore, he shall execute judgment in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.22'>And the righteous need not fear, for they are those who shall not be confounded. But it is the kingdom of the devil, which shall be built up among the children of men, which kingdom is established among them which are in the flesh-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.23'>For the time speedily shall come that all churches which are built up to get gain, and all those who are built up to get power over the flesh, and those who are built up to become popular in the eyes of the world, and those who seek the lusts of the flesh and the things of the world, and to do all manner of iniquity; yea, in fine, all those who belong to the kingdom of the devil are they who need fear, and tremble, and quake; they are those who must be brought low in the dust; they are those who must be consumed as stubble; and this is according to the words of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.24'>And the time cometh speedily that the righteous must be led up as calves of the stall, and the Holy One of Israel must reign in dominion, and might, and power, and great glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.25'>And he gathereth his children from the four quarters of the earth; and he numbereth his sheep, and they know him; and there shall be one fold and one shepherd; and he shall feed his sheep, and in him they shall find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.26'>And because of the righteousness of his people, Satan has no power; wherefore, he cannot be loosed for the space of many years; for he hath no power over the hearts of the people, for they dwell in righteousness, and the Holy One of Israel reigneth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.27'>And now behold, I, Nephi, say unto you that all these things must come according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.28'>But, behold, all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people shall dwell safely in the Holy One of Israel if it so be that they will repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.29'>And now I, Nephi, make an end; for I durst not speak further as yet concerning these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.30'>Wherefore, my brethren, I would that ye should consider that the things which have been written upon the plates of brass are true; and they testify that a man must be obedient to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.22.31'>Wherefore, ye need not suppose that I and my father are the only ones that have testified, and also taught them. Wherefore, if ye shall be obedient to the commandments, and endure to the end, ye shall be saved at the last day. And thus it is. Amen.</verse>
