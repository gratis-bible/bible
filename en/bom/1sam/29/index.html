I do not glory of myself, but I glory in that which the Lord hath commanded me; yea, and this is my glory, that perhaps I may be an instrument in the hands of God to bring some soul to repentance; and this is my joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And behold, when I see many of my brethren truly penitent, and coming to the Lord their God, then is my soul filled with joy; then do I remember what the Lord has done for me, yea, even that he hath heard my prayer; yea, then do I remember his merciful arm which he extended towards me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Yea, and I also remember the captivity of my fathers; for I surely do know that the Lord did deliver them out of bondage, and by this did establish his church; yea, the Lord God, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, did deliver them out of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Yea, I have always remembered the captivity of my fathers; and that same God who delivered them out of the hands of the Egyptians did deliver them out of bondage.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Yea, and that same God did establish his church among them; yea, and that same God hath called me by a holy calling, to preach the word unto this people, and hath given me much success, in the which my joy is full.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But I do not joy in my own success alone, but my joy is more full because of the success of my brethren, who have been up to the land of Nephi.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Behold, they have labored exceedingly, and have brought forth much fruit; and how great shall be their reward!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Now, when I think of the success of these my brethren my soul is carried away, even to the separation of it from the body, as it were, so great is my joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And now may God grant unto these, my brethren, that they may sit down in the kingdom of God; yea, and also all those who are the fruit of their labors that they may go no more out, but that they may praise him forever. And may God grant that it may be done according to my words, even as I have spoken. Amen.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
