Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate? For I am desirous that these records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the forest.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
