        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is God’s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Ps.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>The words of God, which he spake unto Moses at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>And he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses; therefore Moses could endure his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And God spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end, and also my words, for they never cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>Wherefore, no man can behold all my works, except he behold all my glory; and no man can behold all my glory, and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth; but there is no God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I know them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.7'>And now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, Moses, my son, for thou art in the world, and now I show it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.8'>And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which he was created; and Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created; of the same he greatly marveled and wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.9'>And the presence of God withdrew from Moses, that his glory was not upon Moses; and Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left unto himself, he fell unto the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.10'>And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his natural strength like unto man; and he said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.11'>But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.12'>And it came to pass that when Moses had said these words, behold, Satan came tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.13'>And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.14'>For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me, and I were transfigured before him. But I can look upon thee in the natural man. Is it not so, surely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.15'>Blessed be the name of my God, for his Spirit hath not altogether withdrawn from me, or else where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And I can judge between thee and God; for God said unto me: Worship God, for him only shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.16'>Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of mine Only Begotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.17'>And he also gave me commandments when he called unto me out of the burning bush, saying: Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.18'>And again Moses said: I will not cease to call upon God, I have other things to inquire of him: for his glory has been upon me, wherefore I can judge between him and thee. Depart hence, Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.19'>And now, when Moses had said these words, Satan cried with a loud voice, and ranted upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am the Only Begotten, worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.20'>And it came to pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell. Nevertheless, calling upon God, he received strength, and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.21'>And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook; and Moses received strength, and called upon God, saying: In the name of the Only Begotten, depart hence, Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.22'>And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and he departed hence, even from the presence of Moses, that he beheld him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.23'>And now of this thing Moses bore record; but because of wickedness it is not had among the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.24'>And it came to pass that when Satan had departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.25'>And calling upon the name of God, he beheld his glory again, for it was upon him; and he heard a voice, saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have chosen thee, and thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.26'>And lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days; for thou shalt deliver my people from bondage, even Israel my chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.27'>And it came to pass, as the voice was still speaking, Moses cast his eyes and beheld the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold, discerning it by the spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.28'>And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which he beheld not; and he discerned them by the Spirit of God; and their numbers were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.29'>And he beheld many lands; and each land was called earth, and there were inhabitants on the face thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.30'>And it came to pass that Moses called upon God, saying: Tell me, I pray thee, why these things are so, and by what thou madest them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.31'>And behold, the glory of the Lord was upon Moses, so that Moses stood in the presence of God, and talked with him face to face. And the Lord God said unto Moses: For mine own purpose have I made these things. Here is wisdom and it remaineth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.32'>And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.33'>And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.34'>And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.35'>But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.36'>And it came to pass that Moses spake unto the Lord, saying: Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens, and then thy servant will be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.37'>And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.38'>And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come, and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.39'>For behold, this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.40'>And now, Moses, my son, I will speak unto thee concerning this earth upon which thou standest; and thou shalt write the things which I shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.41'>And in a day when the children of men shall esteem my words as naught and take many of them from the book which thou shalt write, behold, I will raise up another like unto thee; and they shall be had again among the children of men-among as many as shall believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.42'>(These words were spoken unto Moses in the mount, the name of which shall not be known among the children of men. And now they are spoken unto you. Show them not unto any except them that believe. Even so. Amen.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.1'>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I reveal unto you concerning this heaven, and this earth; write the words which I speak. I am the Beginning and the End, the Almighty God; by mine Only Begotten I created these things; yea, in the beginning I created the heaven, and the earth upon which thou standest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.2'>And the earth was without form, and void; and I caused darkness to come up upon the face of the deep; and my Spirit moved upon the face of the water; for I am God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.3'>And I, God, said: Let there be light; and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.4'>And I, God, saw the light; and that light was good. And I, God, divided the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.5'>And I, God, called the light Day; and the darkness, I called Night; and this I did by the word of my power, and it was done as I spake; and the evening and the morning were the first day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.6'>And again, I, God, said: Let there be a firmament in the midst of the water, and it was so, even as I spake; and I said: Let it divide the waters from the waters; and it was done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.7'>And I, God, made the firmament and divided the waters, yea, the great waters under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament, and it was so even as I spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.8'>And I, God, called the firmament Heaven; and the evening and the morning were the second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.9'>And I, God, said: Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and it was so; and I, God, said: Let there be dry land; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.10'>And I, God, called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters, called I the Sea; and I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.11'>And I, God, said: Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, the fruit tree yielding fruit, after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself upon the earth, and it was so even as I spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.12'>And the earth brought forth grass, every herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed should be in itself, after his kind; and I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.13'>And the evening and the morning were the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.14'>And I, God, said: Let there be lights in the firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days, and for years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.15'>And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth; and it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.16'>And I, God, made two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the greater light was the sun, and the lesser light was the moon; and the stars also were made even according to my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.17'>And I, God, set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.18'>And the sun to rule over the day, and the moon to rule over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness; and I, God, saw that all things which I had made were good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.19'>And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.20'>And I, God, said: Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl which may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.21'>And I, God, created great whales, and every living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after his kind; and I, God, saw that all things which I had created were good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.22'>And I, God, blessed them, saying: Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the sea; and let fowl multiply in the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.23'>And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.24'>And I, God, said: Let the earth bring forth the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth after their kind, and it was so;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.25'>And I, God, made the beasts of the earth after their kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything which creepeth upon the earth after his kind; and I, God, saw that all these things were good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.26'>And I, God, said unto mine Only Begotten, which was with me from the beginning: Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and it was so. And I, God, said: Let them have dominion over the fishes of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.27'>And I, God, created man in mine own image, in the image of mine Only Begotten created I him; male and female created I them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.28'>And I, God, blessed them, and said unto them: Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.29'>And I, God, said unto man: Behold, I have given you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree in the which shall be the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.30'>And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein I grant life, there shall be given every clean herb for meat; and it was so, even as I spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.2.31'>And I, God, saw everything that I had made, and, behold, all things which I had made were very good; and the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.1'>Thus the heaven and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.2'>And on the seventh day I, God, ended my work, and all things which I had made; and I rested on the seventh day from all my work, and all things which I had made were finished, and I, God, saw that they were good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.3'>And I, God, blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it; because that in it I had rested from all my work which I, God, had created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.4'>And now, behold, I say unto you, that these are the generations of the heaven and of the earth, when they were created, in the day that I, the Lord God, made the heaven and the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.5'>And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every herb of the field before it grew. For I, the Lord God, created all things, of which I have spoken, spiritually, before they were naturally upon the face of the earth. For I, the Lord God, had not caused it to rain upon the face of the earth. And I, the Lord God, had created all the children of men; and not yet a man to till the ground; for in heaven created I them; and there was not yet flesh upon the earth, neither in the water, neither in the air;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.6'>But I, the Lord God, spake, and there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.7'>And I, the Lord God, formed man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul, the first flesh upon the earth, the first man also; nevertheless, all things were before created; but spiritually were they created and made according to my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.8'>And I, the Lord God, planted a garden eastward in Eden, and there I put the man whom I had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.9'>And out of the ground made I, the Lord God, to grow every tree, naturally, that is pleasant to the sight of man; and man could behold it. And it became also a living soul. For it was spiritual in the day that I created it; for it remaineth in the sphere in which I, God, created it, yea, even all things which I prepared for the use of man; and man saw that it was good for food. And I, the Lord God, planted the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and also the tree of knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.10'>And I, the Lord God, caused a river to go out of Eden to water the garden; and from thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.11'>And I, the Lord God, called the name of the first Pison, and it compasseth the whole land of Havilah, where I, the Lord God, created much gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.12'>And the gold of that land was good, and there was bdellium and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.13'>And the name of the second river was called Gihon; the same that compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.14'>And the name of the third river was Hiddekel; that which goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river was the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.15'>And I, the Lord God, took the man, and put him into the Garden of Eden, to dress it, and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.16'>And I, the Lord God, commanded the man, saying: Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.17'>But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.18'>And I, the Lord God, said unto mine Only Begotten, that it was not good that the man should be alone; wherefore, I will make an help meet for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.19'>And out of the ground I, the Lord God, formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and commanded that they should come unto Adam, to see what he would call them; and they were also living souls; for I, God, breathed into them the breath of life, and commanded that whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that should be the name thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.20'>And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but as for Adam, there was not found an help meet for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.21'>And I, the Lord God, caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and he slept, and I took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in the stead thereof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.22'>And the rib which I, the Lord God, had taken from man, made I a woman, and brought her unto the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.23'>And Adam said: This I know now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.24'>Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife; and they shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.3.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ps.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.1'>And I, the Lord God, spake unto Moses, saying: That Satan, whom thou hast commanded in the name of mine Only Begotten, is the same which was from the beginning, and he came before me, saying Behold, here am I, send me, I will be thy son, and I will redeem all mankind, that one soul shall not be lost, and surely I will do it; wherefore give me thine honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.2'>But, behold, my Beloved Son, which was my Beloved and Chosen from the beginning, said unto me Father, thy will be done, and the glory be thine forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.3'>Wherefore, because that Satan rebelled against me, and sought to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him, and also, that I should give unto him mine own power; by the power of mine Only Begotten, I caused that he should be cast down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.4'>And he became Satan, yea, even the devil, the father of all lies, to deceive and to blind men, and to lead them captive at his will, even as many as would not hearken unto my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.5'>And now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which I, the Lord God, had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.6'>And Satan put it into the heart of the serpent, (for he had drawn away many after him,) and he sought also to beguile Eve, for he knew not the mind of God, wherefore he sought to destroy the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.7'>And he said unto the woman: Yea, hath God said Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden? (And he spake by the mouth of the serpent.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.8'>And the woman said unto the serpent: We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.9'>But of the fruit of the tree which thou beholdest in the midst of the garden, God hath said Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.10'>And the serpent said unto the woman: Ye shall not surely die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.4.11'>For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</verse>
