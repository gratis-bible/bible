And he commanded them that they should not cease to pray in their hearts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he commanded them that they should arise and stand up upon their feet.

And behold, I am he who doeth it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that the sword of my justice shall hang over them at that day; and except they repent it shall fall upon them, saith the Father, yea, even upon all the nations of the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And it shall come to pass that I will establish my people, O house of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, this people will I establish in this land, unto the fulfilling of the covenant which I made with your father Jacob; and it shall be a New Jerusalem.

Nevertheless, when they shall have received the fulness of my gospel, then if they shall harden their hearts against me I will return their iniquities upon their own heads, saith the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And I will remember the covenant which I have made with my people; and I have covenanted with them that I would gather them together in mine own due time, that I would give unto them again the land of their fathers for their inheritance, which is the land of Jerusalem, which is the promised land unto them forever, saith the Father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And it shall come to pass that the time cometh, when the fulness of my gospel shall be preached unto them;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they shall believe in me, that I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God, and shall pray unto the Father in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Then shall their watchmen lift up their voice, and with the voice together shall they sing; for they shall see eye to eye.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then will the Father gather them together again, and give unto them Jerusalem for the land of their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Then shall they break forth into joy-Sing together, ye waste places of Jerusalem; for the Father hath comforted his people, he hath redeemed Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>The Father hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation of the Father; and the Father and I are one.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And then shall be brought to pass that which is written: Awake, awake again, and put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city, for henceforth there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the unclean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, O Jerusalem; loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter of Zion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>For thus saith the Lord: Ye have sold yourselves for naught, and ye shall be redeemed without money.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that my people shall know my name; yea, in that day they shall know that I am he that doth speak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And then shall they say: How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that bringeth good tidings unto them, that publisheth peace; that bringeth good tidings unto them of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith unto Zion: Thy God reigneth!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And then shall a cry go forth: Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch not that which is unclean; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean that bear the vessels of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>For ye shall not go out with haste nor go by flight; for the Lord will go before you, and the God of Israel shall be your rearward.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; he shall be exalted and extolled and be very high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>As many were astonished at thee-his visage was so marred, more than any man, and his form more than the sons of men-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their mouths at him, for that which had not been told them shall they see; and that which they had not heard shall they consider.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Verily, verily, I say unto you, all these things shall surely come, even as the Father hath commanded me. Then shall this covenant which the Father hath covenanted with his people be fulfilled; and then shall Jerusalem be inhabited again with my people, and it shall be the land of their inheritance.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
