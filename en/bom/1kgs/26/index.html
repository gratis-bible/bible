And now I, Mormon, make an end of my sayings, and proceed to write the things which have been commanded me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Therefore, I would that ye should behold that the Lord truly did teach the people, for the space of three days; and after that he did show himself unto them oft, and did break bread oft, and bless it, and give it unto them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And it came to pass that he did teach and minister unto the children of the multitude of whom hath been spoken, and he did loose their tongues, and they did speak unto their fathers great and marvelous things, even greater than he had revealed unto the people; and he loosed their tongues that they could utter.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it came to pass that after he had ascended into heaven-the second time that he showed himself unto them, and had gone unto the Father, after having healed all their sick, and their lame, and opened the eyes of their blind and unstopped the ears of the deaf, and even had done all manner of cures among them, and raised a man from the dead, and had shown forth his power unto them, and had ascended unto the Father-</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, it came to pass on the morrow that the multitude gathered themselves together, and they both saw and heard these children; yea, even babes did open their mouths and utter marvelous things; and the things which they did utter were forbidden that there should not any man write them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And it came to pass that the disciples whom Jesus had chosen began from that time forth to baptize and to teach as many as did come unto them; and as many as were baptized in the name of Jesus were filled with the Holy Ghost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And many of them saw and heard unspeakable things, which are not lawful to be written.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they taught, and did minister one to another; and they had all things common among them, every man dealing justly, one with another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And it came to pass that they did do all things even as Jesus had commanded them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they who were baptized in the name of Jesus were called the church of Christ.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
