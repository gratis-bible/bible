Yet I will heal him, for I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Therefore it shall come to pass that whosoever will not believe in my words, who am Jesus Christ, which the Father shall cause him to bring forth unto the Gentiles, and shall give unto him power that he shall bring them forth unto the Gentiles, (it shall be done even as Moses said) they shall be cut off from among my people who are of the covenant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And my people who are a remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles, yea, in the midst of them as a lion among the beasts of the forest, as a young lion among the flocks of sheep, who, if he go through both treadeth down and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Their hand shall be lifted up upon their adversaries, and all their enemies shall be cut off.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Yea, wo be unto the Gentiles except they repent; for it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Father, that I will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will destroy thy chariots;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all thy strongholds;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thy land, and thou shalt have no more soothsayers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Thy graven images I will also cut off, and thy standing images out of the midst of thee, and thou shalt no more worship the works of thy hands;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee; so will I destroy thy cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And it shall come to pass that all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and priestcrafts, and whoredoms, shall be done away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For it shall come to pass, saith the Father, that at that day whosoever will not repent and come unto my Beloved Son, them will I cut off from among my people, O house of Israel;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And I will execute vengeance and fury upon them, even as upon the heathen, such as they have not heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But if they will repent and hearken unto my words, and harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them, and they shall come in unto the covenant and be numbered among this the remnant of Jacob, unto whom I have given this land for their inheritance;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall assist my people, the remnant of Jacob, and also as many of the house of Israel as shall come, that they may build a city, which shall be called the New Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And then shall they assist my people that they may be gathered in, who are scattered upon all the face of the land, in unto the New Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And then shall the power of heaven come down among them; and I also will be in the midst.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And then shall the work of the Father commence at that day, even when this gospel shall be preached among the remnant of this people. Verily I say unto you, at that day shall the work of the Father commence among all the dispersed of my people, yea, even the tribes which have been lost, which the Father hath led away out of Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Yea, the work shall commence among all the dispersed of my people, with the Father to prepare the way whereby they may come unto me, that they may call on the Father in my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Yea, and then shall the work commence, with the Father among all nations in preparing the way whereby his people may be gathered home to the land of their inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they shall go out from all nations; and they shall not go out in haste, nor go by flight, for I will go before them, saith the Father, and I will be their rearward.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
