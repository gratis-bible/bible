        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is God’s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>AND now behold, it came to pass in the *commencement of the fortieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there began to be a serious difficulty among the people of the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>Now these are their names who did contend for the judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for he had many), but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat; therefore, they did cause three divisions among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>Nevertheless, it came to pass that Pahoran was appointed by the voice of the people to be chief judge and a governor over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And it came to pass that Pacumeni, when he saw that he could not obtain the judgment-seat, he did unite with the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>But behold, Paanchi, and that part of the people that were desirous that he should be their governor, was exceedingly wroth; therefore, he was about to flatter away those people to rise up in rebellion against their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the liberty of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>Now when those people who were desirous that he should be their governor saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry, and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>And he went unto those that sent him, and they all entered into a covenant, yea, swearing by their everlasting Maker, that they would tell no man that Kishkumen had murdered Pahoran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>Therefore, Kishkumen was not known among the people of Nephi, for he was in disguise at the time that he murdered Pahoran. And Kishkumen and his band, who had covenanted with him, did mingle themselves among the people, in a manner that they all could not be found; but as many as were found were condemned unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And now behold, Pacumeni was appointed, according to the voice of the people, to be a chief judge and a governor over the people, to reign in the stead of his brother Pahoran; and it was according to his right. And all this was done in the fortieth year of the reign of the judges; and it had an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>And it came to pass in the *forty and first year of the reign of the judges, that the Lamanites had gathered together an innumerable army of men, and armed them with swords, and with cimeters and with bows, and with arrows, and with head-plates, and with breastplates, and with all manner of shields of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And they came down again that they might pitch battle against the Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>Therefore, the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron, supposing that Coriantumr, being a mighty man, could stand against the Nephites, with his strength and also with his great wisdom, insomuch that by sending him forth he should gain power over the Nephites-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>Therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that they should march down to the land of Zarahemla to battle against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much difficulty in the government, that they had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their lands to attack that great city Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was with such exceedingly great speed that there was no time for the Nephites to gather together their armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch that they did take possession of the whole city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>And it came to pass that Pacumeni, who was the chief judge, did flee before Coriantumr, even to the walls of the city. And it came to pass that Coriantumr did smite him against the wall, insomuch that he died. And thus ended the days of Pacumeni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart took courage insomuch that he was about to go forth against all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>And, supposing that their greatest strength was in the center of the land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves together save it were in small bodies; and in this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the center of the land gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the number of the Nephites who were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the center of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and had taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.28'>But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent forth Lehi with an army round about to head them before they should come to the land Bountiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.29'>And thus he did; and he did head them before they came to the land Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.30'>And it came to pass that Moronihah did head them in their retreat, and did give unto them battle, insomuch that it became an exceedingly bloody battle; yea, many were slain, and among the number who were slain Coriantumr was also found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.31'>And now, behold, the Lamanites could not retreat either way, neither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on the west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.32'>And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into the midst of the Nephites, insomuch that they were in the power of the Nephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield themselves into the hands of the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.33'>And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the city of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites who had been taken prisoners should depart out of the land in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.34'>And thus ended the forty and first year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>AND it came to pass in the *forty and second year of the reign of the judges, after Moronihah had established again peace between the Nephites and the Lamanites, behold there was no one to fill the judgment-seat; therefore there began to be a contention again among the people concerning who should fill the judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>And it came to pass that Helaman, who was the son of Helaman, was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, by the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>But behold, Kishkumen, who had murdered Pahoran, did lay wait to destroy Helaman also; and he was upheld by his band, who had entered into a covenant that no one should know his wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>For there was one Gadianton, who was exceedingly expert in many words, and also in his craft, to carry on the secret work of murder and of robbery; therefore he became the leader of the band of Kishkumen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>Therefore he did flatter them, and also Kishkumen, that if they would place him in the judgment-seat he would grant unto those who belonged to his band that they should be placed in power and authority among the people; therefore Kishkumen sought to destroy Helaman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>And it came to pass as he went forth towards the judgment-seat to destroy Helaman, behold one of the servants of Helaman, having been out by night, and having obtained, through disguise, a knowledge of those plans which had been laid by this band to destroy Helaman-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>And it came to pass that he met Kishkumen, and he gave unto him a sign; therefore Kishkumen made known unto him the object of his desire, desiring that he would conduct him to the judgment-seat that he might murder Helaman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>And when the servant of Helaman had known all the heart of Kishkumen, and how that it was his object to murder, and also that it was the object of all those who belonged to his band to murder, and to rob, and to gain power, (and this was their secret plan, and their combination) the servant of Helaman said unto Kishkumen: Let us go forth unto the judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>And it came to pass that Helaman did send forth to take this band of robbers and secret murderers, that they might be executed according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>But behold, when Gadianton had found that Kishkumen did not return he feared lest that he should be destroyed; therefore he caused that his band should follow him. And they took their flight out of the land, by a secret way, into the wilderness; and thus when Helaman sent forth to take them they could nowhere be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>And more of this Gadianton shall be spoken hereafter. And thus ended the forty and second year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And behold, in the end of this book ye shall see that this Gadianton did prove the overthrow, yea, almost the entire destruction of the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>Behold I do not mean the end of the book of Helaman, but I mean the end of the book of Nephi, from which I have taken all the account which I have written.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>AND now it came to pass in the *forty and third year of the reign of the judges, there was no contention among the people of Nephi save it were a little pride which was in the church, which did cause some little dissensions among the people, which affairs were settled in the ending of the forty and third year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And there was no contention among the people in the forty and fourth year; neither was there much contention in the forty and fifth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>And it came to pass in the *forty and sixth, yea, there was much contention and many dissensions; in the which there were an exceedingly great many who departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and went forth unto the land northward to inherit the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>And they did travel to an exceedingly great distance, insomuch that they came to large bodies of water and many rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>Yea, and even they did spread forth into all parts of the land, into whatever parts it had not been rendered desolate and without timber, because of the many inhabitants who had before inherited the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>And now no part of the land was desolate, save it were for timber; but because of the greatness of the destruction of the people who had before inhabited the land it was called desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>And there being but little timber upon the face of the land, nevertheless the people who went forth became exceedingly expert in the working of cement; therefore they did build houses of cement, in the which they did dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>And it came to pass that they did multiply and spread, and did go forth from the land southward to the land northward, and did spread insomuch that they began to cover the face of the whole earth, from the sea south to the sea north, from the sea west to the sea east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>And the people who were in the land northward did dwell in tents, and in houses of cement, and they did suffer whatsoever tree should spring up upon the face of the land that it should grow up, that in time they might have timber to build their houses, yea, their cities, and their temples, and their synagogues, and their sanctuaries, and all manner of their buildings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>And it came to pass as timber was exceedingly scarce in the land northward, they did send forth much by the way of shipping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And thus they did enable the people in the land northward that they might build many cities, both of wood and of cement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And it came to pass that there were many of the people of Ammon, who were Lamanites by birth, did also go forth into this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And now there are many records kept of the proceedings of this people, by many of this people, which are particular and very large, concerning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>But behold, a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, yea, the account of the Lamanites and of the Nephites, and their wars, and contentions, and dissensions, and their preaching, and their prophecies, and their shipping and their building of ships, and their building of temples, and of synagogues and their sanctuaries, and their righteousness, and their wickedness, and their murders, and their robbings, and their plundering, and all manner of abominations and whoredoms, cannot be contained in this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>But behold, there are many books and many records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And they have been handed down from one generation to another by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And now I return again to mine account; therefore, what I have spoken had passed after there had been great contentions, and disturbances, and wars, and dissensions, among the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And it came to pass that there was still great contention in the land, yea, even in the *forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of Lehi. And they began to grow up unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to cease, in a small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>And it came to pass in the *forty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the robber had established in the more settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those who were at the head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>And it came to pass that in this same year there was exceedingly great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there were thousands who did join themselves unto the church and were baptized unto repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>And so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even the high priests and the teachers were themselves astonished beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper unto the baptizing and uniting to the church of God, many souls, yea, even tens of thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And in this year there was continual rejoicing in the land of Zarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And it came to pass that there was peace and exceedingly great joy in the remainder of the forty and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual peace and great joy in the fiftieth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And in the *fifty and first year of the reign of the judges there was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter into the church-not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>And they were lifted up in pride, even to the persecution of many of their brethren. Now this was a great evil, which did cause the more humble part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceedingly great pride which had gotten into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>And it came to pass in the *fifty and third year of the reign of the judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>AND it came to pass in the *fifty and fourth year there were many dissensions in the church, and there was also a contention among the people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and they did go unto the king of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the Lamanites to war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites were exceedingly afraid, insomuch that they would not hearken to the words of those dissenters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, there were dissenters who went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And in the *fifty and seventh year they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in obtaining possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And the Nephites and the armies of Moronihah were driven even into the land of Bountiful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>And there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the west sea, even unto the east; it being a day's journey for a Nephite, on the line which they had fortified and stationed their armies to defend their north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a numerous army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession of the Nephites which was in the land southward. And all this was done in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the reign of the judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies in obtaining many parts of the land; yea, they regained many cities which had fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>And it came to pass in the *sixty and first year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in regaining even the half of all their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, would not have happened had it not been for their wickedness and their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among those also who professed to belong to the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering, lying, stealing, committing adultery, rising up in great contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the Lamanites-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.13'>And because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost all their lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.14'>But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people because of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, who were the sons of Helaman, did preach many things unto the people, yea, and did prophesy many things unto them concerning their iniquities, and what should come unto them if they did not repent of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.15'>And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did repent they did begin to prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.16'>For when Moronihah saw that they did repent he did venture to lead them forth from place to place, and from city to city, even until they had regained the one-half of their property and the one-half of all their lands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.19'>Therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the remainder of their lands, for so numerous were the Lamanites that it became impossible for the Nephites to obtain more power over them; therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in maintaining those parts which he had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.20'>And it came to pass, because of the greatness of the number of the Lamanites the Nephites were in great fear, lest they should be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.21'>Yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also the words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a stiffnecked people, and that they had set at naught the commandments of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.22'>And that they had altered and trampled under their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and they saw that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.23'>And because of their iniquity the church had begun to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.24'>And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.25'>Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were exceedingly more numerous than they, and except they should cleave unto the Lord their God they must unavoidably perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.26'>For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great as their strength, even man for man. And thus had they fallen into this great transgression; yea, thus had they become weak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.6.41'>And it came to pass that thus ended the sixty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.1'>BEHOLD, now it came to pass in the *sixty and ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of the Nephites, that Nephi, the son of Helaman, returned to the land of Zarahemla from the land northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.2'>For he had been forth among the people who were in the land northward, and did preach the word of God unto them, and did prophesy many things unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.3'>And they did reject all his words, insomuch that he could not stay among them, but returned again unto the land of his nativity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.4'>And seeing the people in a state of such awful wickedness, and those Gadianton robbers filling the judgment-seats-having usurped the power and authority of the land; laying aside the commandments of God, and not in the least aright before him; doing no justice unto the children of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.5'>Condemning the righteous because of their righteousness; letting the guilty and the wicked go unpunished because of their money; and moreover to be held in office at the head of government, to rule and do according to their wills, that they might get gain and glory of the world, and, moreover, that they might the more easily commit adultery, and steal, and kill, and do according to their own wills-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.6'>Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.7'>Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.8'>Yea, if my days could have been in those days, then would my soul have had joy in the righteousness of my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.9'>But behold, I am consigned that these are my days, and that my soul shall be filled with sorrow because of this the wickedness of my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.10'>And behold, now it came to pass that it was upon a tower, which was in the garden of Nephi, which was by the highway which led to the chief market, which was in the city of Zarahemla; therefore, Nephi had bowed himself upon the tower which was in his garden, which tower was also near unto the garden gate by which led the highway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.11'>And it came to pass that there were certain men passing by and saw Nephi as he was pouring out his soul unto God upon the tower; and they ran and told the people what they had seen, and the people came together in multitudes that they might know the cause of so great mourning for the wickedness of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.12'>And now, when Nephi arose he beheld the multitudes of people who had gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.13'>And it came to pass that he opened his mouth and said unto them: Behold, why have ye gathered yourselves together? That I may tell you of your iniquities?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.14'>Yea, because I have got upon my tower that I might pour out my soul unto my God, because of the exceeding sorrow of my heart, which is because of your iniquities!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.15'>And because of my mourning and lamentation ye have gathered yourselves together, and do marvel; yea, and ye have great need to marvel; yea, ye ought to marvel because ye are given away that the devil has got so great hold upon your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.16'>Yea, how could you have given way to the enticing of him who is seeking to hurl away your souls down to everlasting misery and endless wo?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.17'>O repent ye, repent ye! Why will ye die? Turn ye, turn ye unto the Lord your God. Why has he forsaken you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.18'>It is because you have hardened your hearts; yea, ye will not hearken unto the voice of the good shepherd; yea, ye have provoked him to anger against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.19'>And behold, instead of gathering you, except ye will repent, behold, he shall scatter you forth that ye shall become meat for dogs and wild beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.20'>O, how could you have forgotten your God in the very day that he has delivered you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.21'>But behold, it is to get gain, to be praised of men, yea, and that ye might get gold and silver. And ye have set your hearts upon the riches and the vain things of this world, for the which ye do murder, and plunder, and steal, and bear false witness against your neighbor, and do all manner of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.22'>And for this cause wo shall come unto you except ye shall repent. For if ye will not repent, behold, this great city, and also all those great cities which are round about, which are in the land of our possession, shall be taken away that ye shall have no place in them; for behold, the Lord will not grant unto you strength, as he has hitherto done, to withstand against your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.23'>For behold, thus saith the Lord: I will not show unto the wicked of my strength, to one more than the other, save it be unto those who repent of their sins, and hearken unto my words. Now therefore, I would that ye should behold, my brethren, that it shall be better for the Lamanites than for you except ye shall repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.24'>For behold, they are more righteous than you, for they have not sinned against that great knowledge which ye have received; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them; yea, he will lengthen out their days and increase their seed, even when thou shalt be utterly destroyed except thou shalt repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.25'>Yea, wo be unto you because of that great abomination which has come among you; and ye have united yourselves unto it, yea, to that secret band which was established by Gadianton!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.26'>Yea, wo shall come unto you because of that pride which ye have suffered to enter your hearts, which has lifted you up beyond that which is good because of your exceedingly great riches!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.27'>Yea, wo be unto you because of your wickedness and abominations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.28'>And except ye repent ye shall perish; yea, even your lands shall be taken from you, and ye shall be destroyed from off the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.29'>Behold now, I do not say that these things shall be, of myself, because it is not of myself that I know these things; but behold, I know that these things are true because the Lord God has made them known unto me, therefore I testify that they shall be.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.1'>AND now it came to pass that when Nephi had said these words, behold, there were men who were judges, who also belonged to the secret band of Gadianton, and they were angry, and they cried out against him, saying unto the people: Why do ye not seize upon this man and bring him forth, that he may be condemned according to the crime which he has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.2'>Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people and against our law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.3'>For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.4'>And those judges were angry with him because he spake plainly unto them concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for they feared the people lest they should cry out against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.5'>Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer this man to revile against us? For behold he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.6'>And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are powerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no power over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.7'>And it came to pass that thus they did stir up the people to anger against Nephi, and raised contentions among them; for there were some who did cry out: Let this man alone, for he is a good man, and those things which he saith will surely come to pass except we repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.8'>Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities. And behold they are many, and he knoweth as well all things which shall befall us as he knoweth of our iniquities;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.9'>Yea, and behold, if he had not been a prophet he could not have testified concerning those things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.10'>And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.11'>Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying: Behold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swallowed them up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.12'>And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.13'>But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great power given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.14'>Yea, did he not bear record that the Son of God should come? And as he lifted up the brazen serpent in the wilderness, even so shall he be lifted up who should come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.15'>And as many as should look upon that serpent should live, even so as many as should look upon the Son of God with faith, having a contrite spirit, might live, even unto that life which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.16'>And now behold, Moses did not only testify of these things, but also all the holy prophets, from his days even to the days of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.17'>Yea, and behold, Abraham saw of his coming, and was filled with gladness and did rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.18'>Yea, and behold I say unto you, that Abraham not only knew of these things, but there were many before the days of Abraham who were called by the order of God; yea, even after the order of his Son; and this that it should be shown unto the people, a great many thousand years before his coming, that even redemption should come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.19'>And now I would that ye should know, that even since the days of Abraham there have been many prophets that have testified these things; yea, behold, the prophet Zenos did testify boldly; for the which he was slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.20'>And behold, also Zenock, and also Ezias, and also Isaiah, and Jeremiah, (Jeremiah being that same prophet who testified of the destruction of Jerusalem) and now we know that Jerusalem was destroyed according to the words of Jeremiah. O then why not the Son of God come, according to his prophecy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.21'>And now will you dispute that Jerusalem was destroyed? Will ye say that the sons of Zedekiah were not slain, all except it were Mulek? Yea, and do ye not behold that the seed of Zedekiah are with us, and they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem? But behold, this is not all-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.22'>Our father Lehi was driven out of Jerusalem because he testified of these things. Nephi also testified of these things, and also almost all of our fathers, even down to this time; yea, they have testified of the coming of Christ, and have looked forward, and have rejoiced in his day which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.23'>And behold, he is God, and he is with them, and he did manifest himself unto them, that they were redeemed by him; and they gave unto him glory, because of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.24'>And now, seeing ye know these things and cannot deny them except ye shall lie, therefore in this ye have sinned, for ye have rejected all these things, notwithstanding so many evidences which ye have received; yea, even ye have received all things, both things in heaven, and all things which are in the earth, as a witness that they are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.25'>But behold, ye have rejected the truth, and rebelled against your holy God; and even at this time, instead of laying up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where nothing doth corrupt, and where nothing can come which is unclean, ye are heaping up for yourselves wrath against the day of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.26'>Yea, even at this time ye are ripening, because of your murders and your fornication and wickedness, for everlasting destruction; yea, and except ye repent it will come unto you soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.27'>Yea, behold it is now even at your doors; yea, go ye in unto the judgment-seat, and search; and behold, your judge is murdered, and he lieth in his blood; and he hath been murdered by his brother, who seeketh to sit in the judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.28'>And behold, they both belong to your secret band, whose author is Gadianton and the evil one who seeketh to destroy the souls of men.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.1'>BEHOLD, now it came to pass that when Nephi had spoken these words, certain men who were among them ran to the judgment-seat; yea, even there were five who went, and they said among themselves, as they went:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.2'>Behold, now we will know of a surety whether this man be a prophet and God hath commanded him to prophesy such marvelous things unto us. Behold, we do not believe that he hath; yea, we do not believe that he is a prophet; nevertheless, if this thing which he has said concerning the chief judge be true, that he be dead, then will we believe that the other words which he has spoken are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.3'>And it came to pass that they ran in their might, and came in unto the judgment-seat; and behold, the chief judge had fallen to the earth, and did lie in his blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.4'>And now behold, when they saw this they were astonished exceedingly, insomuch that they fell to the earth; for they had not believed the words which Nephi had spoken concerning the chief judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.5'>But now, when they saw they believed, and fear came upon them lest all the judgments which Nephi had spoken should come upon the people; therefore they did quake, and had fallen to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.6'>Now, immediately when the judge had been murdered-he being stabbed by his brother by a garb of secrecy, and he fled, and the servants ran and told the people, raising the cry of murder among them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.8'>And now behold, the people knew nothing concerning the multitude who had gathered together at the garden of Nephi; therefore they said among themselves: These men are they who have murdered the judge, and God has smitten them that they could not flee from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.9'>And it came to pass that they laid hold on them, and bound them and cast them into prison. And there was a proclamation sent abroad that the judge was slain, and that the murderers had been taken and were cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.10'>And it came to pass that on the morrow the people did assemble themselves together to mourn and to fast, at the burial of the great chief judge who had been slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.11'>And thus also those judges who were at the garden of Nephi, and heard his words, were also gathered together at the burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.12'>And it came to pass that they inquired among the people, saying: Where are the five who were sent to inquire concerning the chief judge whether he was dead? And they answered and said: Concerning this five whom ye say ye have sent, we know not; but there are five who are the murderers, whom we have cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.13'>And it came to pass that the judges desired that they should be brought; and they were brought, and behold they were the five who were sent; and behold the judges inquired of them to know concerning the matter, and they told them all that they had done, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.14'>We ran and came to the place of the judgment-seat, and when we saw all things even as Nephi had testified, we were astonished insomuch that we fell to the earth; and when we were recovered from our astonishment, behold they cast us into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.15'>Now, as for the murder of this man, we know not who has done it; and only this much we know, we ran and came according as ye desired, and behold he was dead, according to the words of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.16'>And now it came to pass that the judges did expound the matter unto the people, and did cry out against Nephi, saying: Behold, we know that this Nephi must have agreed with some one to slay the judge, and then he might declare it unto us, that he might convert us unto his faith, that he might raise himself to be a great man, chosen of God, and a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.17'>And now behold, we will detect this man, and he shall confess his fault and make known unto us the true murderer of this judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.18'>And it came to pass that the five were liberated on the day of the burial. Nevertheless, they did rebuke the judges in the words which they had spoken against Nephi, and did contend with them one by one, insomuch that they did confound them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.9.19'>Nevertheless, they caused that Nephi should be taken and bound and brought before the multitude, and they began to question him in divers ways that they might cross him, that they might accuse him to death-</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.14'>Therefore Nephi did declare unto them the word of the Lord, saying: Except ye repent, thus saith the Lord, ye shall be smitten even unto destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.15'>And it came to pass that when Nephi had declared unto them the word, behold, they did still harden their hearts and would not hearken unto his words; therefore they did revile against him, and did seek to lay their hands upon him that they might cast him into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.16'>But behold, the power of God was with him, and they could not take him to cast him into prison, for he was taken by the Spirit and conveyed away out of the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.17'>And it came to pass that thus he did go forth in the Spirit, from multitude to multitude, declaring the word of God, even until he had declared it unto them all, or sent it forth among all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.10.18'>And it came to pass that they would not hearken unto his words; and there began to be contentions, insomuch that they were divided against themselves and began to slay one another with the sword.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.1'>AND now it came to pass in the *seventy and second year of the reign of the judges that the contentions did increase, insomuch that there were wars throughout all the land among all the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.2'>And it was this secret band of robbers who did carry on this work of destruction and wickedness. And this war did last all that year; and in the *seventy and third year it did also last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.3'>And it came to pass that in this year Nephi did cry unto the Lord, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.4'>O Lord, do not suffer that this people shall be destroyed by the sword; but O Lord, rather let there be a famine in the land, to stir them up in remembrance of the Lord their God, and perhaps they will repent and turn unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.5'>And so it was done, according to the words of Nephi. And there was a great famine upon the land, among all the people of Nephi. And thus in the *seventy and fourth year the famine did continue, and the work of destruction did cease by the sword but became sore by famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.6'>And this work of destruction did also continue in the *seventy and fifth year. For the earth was smitten that it was dry, and did not yield forth grain in the season of grain; and the whole earth was smitten, even among the Lamanites as well as among the Nephites, so that they were smitten that they did perish by thousands in the more wicked parts of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.7'>And it came to pass that the people saw that they were about to perish by famine, and they began to remember the Lord their God; and they began to remember the words of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.8'>And the people began to plead with their chief judges and their leaders, that they would say unto Nephi: Behold, we know that thou art a man of God, and therefore cry unto the Lord our God that he turn away from us this famine, lest all the words which thou hast spoken concerning our destruction be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.9'>And it came to pass that the judges did say unto Nephi, according to the words which had been desired. And it came to pass that when Nephi saw that the people had repented and did humble themselves in sackcloth, he cried again unto the Lord, saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.11'>Now, O Lord, because of this their humility wilt thou turn away thine anger, and let thine anger be appeased in the destruction of those wicked men whom thou hast already destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.12'>O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, yea, thy fierce anger, and cause that this famine may cease in this land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>Yea, O Lord, and thou seest that they have repented, because of the famine and the pestilence and destruction which has come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>And now, O Lord, wilt thou turn away thine anger, and try again if they will serve thee? And if so, O Lord, thou canst bless them according to thy words which thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>And it came to pass that in the *seventy and sixth year the Lord did turn away his anger from the people, and caused that rain should fall upon the earth, insomuch that it did bring forth her fruit in the season of her fruit. And it came to pass that it did bring forth her grain in the season of her grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>And behold, the people did rejoice and glorify God, and the whole face of the land was filled with rejoicing; and they did no more seek to destroy Nephi, but they did esteem him as a great prophet, and a man of God, having great power and authority given unto him from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>And behold, Lehi, his brother, was not a whit behind him as to things pertaining to righteousness.</verse>

And the seventy and seventh year began in peace; and the church did spread throughout the face of all the land; and the more part of the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, did belong to the church; and they did have exceedingly great peace in the land; and thus ended the seventy and seventh year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>And also they had peace in the seventy and eighth year, save it were a few contentions concerning the points of doctrine which had been laid down by the prophets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>And it came to pass that in the *eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were a certain number of the dissenters from the people of Nephi, who had some years before gone over unto the Lamanites, and taken upon themselves the name of Lamanites, and also a certain number who were real descendants of the Lamanites, being stirred up to anger by them, or by those dissenters, therefore they commenced a war with their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>And they did commit murder and plunder; and then they would retreat back into the mountains, and into the wilderness and secret places, hiding themselves that they could not be discovered, receiving daily an addition to their numbers, inasmuch as there were dissenters that went forth unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>And thus in time, yea, even in the space of not many years, they became an exceedingly great band of robbers; and they did search out all the secret plans of Gadianton; and thus they became robbers of Gadianton.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>Now behold, these robbers did make great havoc, yea, even great destruction among the people of Nephi, and also among the people of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.28'>And it came to pass that it was expedient that there should be a stop put to this work of destruction; therefore they sent an army of strong men into the wilderness and upon the mountains to search out this band of robbers, and to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.29'>But behold, it came to pass that in that same year they were driven back even into their own lands. And thus ended the eightieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>

O Lord, canst thou not turn away thine anger from us? And this shall be your language in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>But behold, your days of probation are past; ye have procrastinated the day of your salvation until it is everlastingly too late, and your destruction is made sure; yea, for ye have sought all the days of your lives for that which ye could not obtain; and ye have sought for happiness in doing iniquity, which thing is contrary to the nature of that righteousness which is in our great and Eternal Head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.39'>O ye people of the land, that ye would hear my words! And I pray that the anger of the Lord be turned away from you, and that ye would repent and be saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.1'>AND now it came to pass that Samuel, the Lamanite, did prophesy a great many more things which cannot be written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.2'>And behold, he said unto them: Behold, I give unto you a sign; for five years more cometh, and behold, then cometh the Son of God to redeem all those who shall believe on his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.3'>And behold, this will I give unto you for a sign at the time of his coming; for behold, there shall be great lights in heaven, insomuch that in the night before he cometh there shall be no darkness, insomuch that it shall appear unto man as if it was day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.4'>Therefore, there shall be one day and a night and a day, as if it were one day and there were no night; and this shall be unto you for a sign; for ye shall know of the rising of the sun and also of its setting; therefore they shall know of a surety that there shall be two days and a night; nevertheless the night shall not be darkened; and it shall be the night before he is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.5'>And behold, there shall a new star arise, such an one as ye never have beheld; and this also shall be a sign unto you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.10'>And now, because I am a Lamanite, and have spoken unto you the words which the Lord hath commanded me, and because it was hard against you, ye are angry with me and do seek to destroy me, and have cast me out from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.11'>And ye shall hear my words, for, for this intent have I come up upon the walls of this city, that ye might hear and know of the judgments of God which do await you because of your iniquities, and also that ye might know the conditions of repentance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.12'>And also that ye might know of the coming of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and of earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and that ye might know of the signs of his coming, to the intent that ye might believe on his name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.16'>Yea, behold, this death bringeth to pass the resurrection, and redeemeth all mankind from the first death-that spiritual death; for all mankind, by the fall of Adam being cut off from the presence of the Lord, are considered as dead, both as to things temporal and to things spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.17'>But behold, the resurrection of Christ redeemeth mankind, yea, even all mankind, and bringeth them back into the presence of the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.19'>Therefore repent ye, repent ye, lest by knowing these things and not doing them ye shall suffer yourselves to come under condemnation, and ye are brought down unto this second death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>AND now, it came to pass that there were many who heard the words of Samuel, the Lamanite, which he spake upon the walls of the city. And as many as believed on his word went forth and sought for Nephi; and when they had come forth and found him they confessed unto him their sins and denied not, desiring that they might be baptized unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>But as many as there were who did not believe in the words of Samuel were angry with him; and they cast stones at him upon the wall, and also many shot arrows at him as he stood upon the wall; but the Spirit of the Lord was with him, insomuch that they could not hit him with their stones neither with their arrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>Now when they saw that they could not hit him, there were many more who did believe on his words, insomuch that they went away unto Nephi to be baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>For behold, Nephi was baptizing, and prophesying, and preaching, crying repentance unto the people, showing signs and wonders, working miracles among the people, that they might know that the Christ must shortly come-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>Telling them of things which must shortly come, that they might know and remember at the time of their coming that they had been made known unto them beforehand, to the intent that they might believe; therefore as many as believed on the words of Samuel went forth unto him to be baptized, for they came repenting and confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>But the more part of them did not believe in the words of Samuel; therefore when they saw that they could not hit him with their stones and their arrows, they cried unto their captains, saying: Take this fellow and bind him, for behold he hath a devil; and because of the power of the devil which is in him we cannot hit him with our stones and our arrows; therefore take him and bind him, and away with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>And as they went forth to lay their hands on him, behold, he did cast himself down from the wall, and did flee out of their lands, yea, even unto his own country, and began to preach and to prophesy among his own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>And behold, he was never heard of more among the Nephites; and thus were the affairs of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.9'>And thus ended the eighty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>And thus ended also the *eighty and seventh year of the reign of the judges, the more part of the people remaining in their pride and wickedness, and the lesser part walking more circumspectly before God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>And there was but little alteration in the affairs of the people, save it were the people began to be more hardened in iniquity, and do more and more of that which was contrary to the commandments of God, in the eighty and ninth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>But it came to pass in the *ninetieth year of the reign of the judges, there were great signs given unto the people, and wonders; and the words of the prophets began to be fulfilled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield ourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>And many more things did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all the face of the land.</verse>
