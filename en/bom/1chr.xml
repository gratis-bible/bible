        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is God’s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

      <chapter osisID='1Chr.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.1'>AND now I, Mormon, make a record of the things which I have both seen and heard, and call it the Book of Mormon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.2'>And about the time that Ammaron hid up the records unto the Lord, he came unto me, (I being about ten years of age, and I began to be learned somewhat after the manner of the learning of my people) and Ammaron said unto me: I perceive that thou art a sober child, and art quick to observe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.3'>Therefore, when ye are about twenty and four years old I would that ye should remember the things that ye have observed concerning this people; and when ye are of that age go to the land Antum, unto a hill which shall be called Shim; and there have I deposited unto the Lord all the sacred engravings concerning this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.4'>And behold, ye shall take the plates of Nephi unto yourself, and the remainder shall ye leave in the place where they are; and ye shall engrave on the plates of Nephi all the things that ye have observed concerning this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.5'>And I, Mormon, being a descendant of Nephi, (and my father's name was Mormon) I remembered the things which Ammaron commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.6'>And it came to pass that I, being *eleven years old, was carried by my father into the land southward, even to the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.7'>The whole face of the land had become covered with buildings, and the people were as numerous almost, as it were the sand of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.8'>And it came to pass in this year there began to be a war between the Nephites, who consisted of the Nephites and the Jacobites and the Josephites and the Zoramites; and this war was between the Nephites, and the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.9'>Now the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites were called Lamanites, and the two parties were Nephites and Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.10'>And it came to pass that the war began to be among them in the borders of Zarahemla, by the waters of Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.11'>And it came to pass that the Nephites had gathered together a great number of men, even to exceed the number of thirty thousand. And it came to pass that they did have in this same year a number of battles, in which the Nephites did beat the Lamanites and did slay many of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.12'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites withdrew their design, and there was peace settled in the land; and peace did remain for the space of about four years, that there was no bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.13'>But wickedness did prevail upon the face of the whole land, insomuch that the Lord did take away his beloved disciples, and the work of miracles and of healing did cease because of the iniquity of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.14'>And there were no gifts from the Lord, and the Holy Ghost did not come upon any, because of their wickedness and unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.15'>And I, *being fifteen years of age and being somewhat of a sober mind, therefore I was visited of the Lord, and tasted and knew of the goodness of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.16'>And I did endeavor to preach unto this people, but my mouth was shut, and I was forbidden that I should preach unto them; for behold they had wilfully rebelled against their God; and the beloved disciples were taken away out of the land, because of their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.17'>But I did remain among them, but I was forbidden to preach unto them, because of the hardness of their hearts; and because of the hardness of their hearts the land was cursed for their sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.18'>And these Gadianton robbers, who were among the Lamanites, did infest the land, insomuch that the inhabitants thereof began to hide up their treasures in the earth; and they became slippery, because the Lord had cursed the land, that they could not hold them, nor retain them again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.1.19'>And it came to pass that there were sorceries, and witchcrafts, and magics; and the power of the evil one was wrought upon all the face of the land, even unto the fulfilling of all the words of Abinadi, and also Samuel the Lamanite.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.1'>AND it came to pass in that same year there began to be a war again between the Nephites and the Lamanites. And notwithstanding I being young, was large in stature; therefore the people of Nephi appointed me that I should be their leader, or the leader of their armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.2'>Therefore it came to pass that *in my sixteenth year I did go forth at the head of an army of the Nephites, against the Lamanites; therefore three hundred and twenty and six years had passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.3'>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and twenty and seventh year the Lamanites did come upon us with exceedingly great power, insomuch that they did frighten my armies; therefore they would not fight, and they began to retreat towards the north countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.4'>And it came to pass that we did come to the city of Angola, and we did take possession of the city, and make preparations to defend ourselves against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did fortify the city with our might; but notwithstanding all our fortifications the Lamanites did come upon us and did drive us out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.5'>And they did also drive us forth out of the land of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.6'>And we marched forth and came to the land of Joshua, which was in the borders west by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.7'>And it came to pass that we did gather in our people as fast as it were possible, that we might get them together in one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.8'>But behold, the land was filled with robbers and with Lamanites; and notwithstanding the great destruction which hung over my people, they did not repent of their evil doings; therefore there was blood and carnage spread throughout all the face of the land, both on the part of the Nephites and also on the part of the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution throughout all the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.9'>And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name was Aaron; and he came against us with an army of forty and four thousand. And behold, I withstood him with forty and two thousand. And it came to pass that I beat him with my army that he fled before me. And behold, all this was done, and *three hundred and thirty years had passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.10'>And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of their iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet; for behold no man could keep that which was his own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.11'>Thus there began to be a mourning and a lamentation in all the land because of these things, and more especially among the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.12'>And it came to pass that when I, Mormon, saw their lamentation and their mourning and their sorrow before the Lord, my heart did begin to rejoice within me, knowing the mercies and the long-suffering of the Lord, therefore supposing that he would be merciful unto them that they would again become a righteous people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.13'>But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.14'>And they did not come unto Jesus with broken hearts and contrite spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die. Nevertheless they would struggle with the sword for their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.15'>And it came to pass that my sorrow did return unto me again, and I saw that the day of grace was passed with them, both temporally and spiritually; for I saw thousands of them hewn down in open rebellion against their God, and heaped up as dung upon the face of the land. And thus *three hundred and forty and four years had passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.16'>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and forty and fifth year the Nephites did begin to flee before the Lamanites; and they were pursued until they came even to the land of Jashon, before it was possible to stop them in their retreat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.17'>And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold I had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, and did make a record according to the words of Ammaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.18'>And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full account of all the wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did forbear to make a full account of their wickedness and abominations, for behold, a continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been sufficient to behold the ways of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.19'>And wo is me because of their wickedness; for my heart has been filled with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days; nevertheless, I know that I shall be lifted up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.20'>And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi again were hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were driven forth until we had come northward to the land which was called Shem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.21'>And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem, and we did gather in our people as much as it were possible, that perhaps we might save them from destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.22'>And it came to pass in the *three hundred and forty and sixth year they began to come upon us again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.23'>And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did urge them with great energy, that they would stand boldly before the Lamanites and fight for their wives, and their children, and their houses, and their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.24'>And my words did arouse them somewhat to vigor, insomuch that they did not flee from before the Lamanites, but did stand with boldness against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.25'>And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand. And it came to pass that we did stand before them with such firmness that they did flee from before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.26'>And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue them with our armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them; nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.27'>And my heart did sorrow because of this the great calamity of my people, because of their wickedness and their abominations. But behold, we did go forth against the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, until we had again taken possession of the lands of our inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.28'>And the *three hundred and forty and ninth year had passed away. And in the three hundred and fiftieth year we made a treaty with the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, in which we did get the lands of our inheritance divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.29'>And the Lamanites did give unto us the land northward, yea, even to the narrow passage which led into the land southward. And we did give unto the Lamanites all the land southward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.1'>AND it came to pass that the Lamanites did not come to battle again *until ten years more had passed away. And behold, I had employed my people, the Nephites, in preparing their lands and their arms against the time of battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.2'>And it came to pass that the Lord did say unto me: Cry unto this people-Repent ye, and come unto me, and be ye baptized, and build up again my church, and ye shall be spared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.3'>And I did cry unto this people, but it was in vain; and they did not realize that it was the Lord that had spared them, and granted unto them a chance for repentance. And behold they did harden their hearts against the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.4'>And it came to pass that after this tenth year had passed away, making, in the whole, three hundred and sixty years from the coming of Christ, the king of the Lamanites sent an epistle unto me, which gave unto me to know that they were preparing to come again to battle against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.5'>And it came to pass that I did cause my people that they should gather themselves together at the land Desolation, to a city which was in the borders, by the narrow pass which led into the land southward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.6'>And there we did place our armies, that we might stop the armies of the Lamanites, that they might not get possession of any of our lands; therefore we did fortify against them with all our force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.7'>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and first year the Lamanites did come down to the city of Desolation to battle against us; and it came to pass that in that year we did beat them, insomuch that they did return to their own lands again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.8'>And in the *three hundred and sixty and second year they did come down again to battle. And we did beat them again, and did slay a great number of them, and their dead were cast into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.9'>And now, because of this great thing which my people, the Nephites, had done, they began to boast in their own strength, and began to swear before the heavens that they would avenge themselves of the blood of their brethren who had been slain by their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.10'>And they did swear by the heavens, and also by the throne of God, that they would go up to battle against their enemies, and would cut them off from the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.11'>And it came to pass that I, Mormon, did utterly refuse from this time forth to be a commander and a leader of this people, because of their wickedness and abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.12'>Behold, I had led them, notwithstanding their wickedness I had led them many times to battle, and had loved them, according to the love of God which was in me, with all my heart; and my soul had been poured out in prayer unto my God all the day long for them; nevertheless, it was without faith, because of the hardness of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.13'>And thrice have I delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and they have repented not of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.14'>And when they had sworn by all that had been forbidden them by our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, that they would go up unto their enemies to battle, and avenge themselves of the blood of their brethren, behold the voice of the Lord came unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.15'>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay; and because this people repented not after I had delivered them, behold, they shall be cut off from the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.16'>And it came to pass that I utterly refused to go up against mine enemies; and I did even as the Lord had commanded me; and I did stand as an idle witness to manifest unto the world the things which I saw and heard, according to the manifestations of the Spirit which had testified of things to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.17'>Therefore I write unto you, Gentiles, and also unto you, house of Israel, when the work shall commence, that ye shall be about to prepare to return to the land of your inheritance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.18'>Yea, behold, I write unto all the ends of the earth; yea, unto you, twelve tribes of Israel, who shall be judged according to your works by the twelve whom Jesus chose to be his disciples in the land of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.19'>And I write also unto the remnant of this people, who shall also be judged by the twelve whom Jesus chose in this land; and they shall be judged by the other twelve whom Jesus chose in the land of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.20'>And these things doth the Spirit manifest unto me; therefore I write unto you all. And for this cause I write unto you, that ye may know that ye must all stand before the judgment-seat of Christ, yea, every soul who belongs to the whole human family of Adam; and ye must stand to be judged of your works, whether they be good or evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.21'>And also that ye may believe the gospel of Jesus Christ, which ye shall have among you; and also that the Jews, the covenant people of the Lord, shall have other witness besides him whom they saw and heard, that Jesus, whom they slew, was the very Christ and the very God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.3.22'>And I would that I could persuade all ye ends of the earth to repent and prepare to stand before the judgment-seat of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.1'>AND now it came to pass that in the *three hundred and sixty and third year the Nephites did go up with their armies to battle against the Lamanites, out of the land Desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.2'>And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites were driven back again to the land of Desolation. And while they were yet weary, a fresh army of the Lamanites did come upon them; and they had a sore battle, insomuch that the Lamanites did take possession of the city Desolation, and did slay many of the Nephites, and did take many prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.3'>And the remainder did flee and join the inhabitants of the city Teancum. Now the city Teancum lay in the borders by the seashore; and it was also near the city Desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.4'>And it was because the armies of the Nephites went up unto the Lamanites that they began to be smitten; for were it not for that, the Lamanites could have had no power over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.5'>But, behold, the judgments of God will overtake the wicked; and it is by the wicked that the wicked are punished; for it is the wicked that stir up the hearts of the children of men unto bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.6'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did make preparations to come against the city Teancum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.7'>And it came to pass in the three hundred and sixty and fourth year the Lamanites did come against the city Teancum, that they might take possession of the city Teancum also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.8'>And it came to pass that they were repulsed and driven back by the Nephites. And when the Nephites saw that they had driven the Lamanites they did again boast of their own strength; and they went forth in their own might, and took possession again of the city Desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.9'>And now all these things had been done, and there had been thousands slain on both sides, both the Nephites and the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.10'>And it came to pass that the three hundred and sixty and sixth year had passed away, and the Lamanites came again upon the Nephites to battle; and yet the Nephites repented not of the evil they had done, but persisted in their wickedness continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.11'>And it is impossible for the tongue to describe, or for man to write a perfect description of the horrible scene of the blood and carnage which was among the people, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites; and every heart was hardened, so that they delighted in the shedding of blood continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.12'>And there never had been so great wickedness among all the children of Lehi, nor even among all the house of Israel, according to the words of the Lord, as was among this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.13'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did take possession of the city Desolation, and this because their number did exceed the number of the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.14'>And they did also march forward against the city Teancum, and did drive the inhabitants forth out of her, and did take many prisoners both women and children, and did offer them up as sacrifices unto their idol gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.15'>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and sixty and seventh year, the Nephites being angry because the Lamanites had sacrificed their women and their children, that they did go against the Lamanites with exceedingly great anger, insomuch that they did beat again the Lamanites, and drive them out of their lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.16'>And the Lamanites did not come again against the Nephites until the three hundred and seventy and fifth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.17'>And in this year they did come down against the Nephites with all their powers; and they were not numbered because of the greatness of their number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.18'>And from this time forth did the Nephites gain no power over the Lamanites, but began to be swept off by them even as a dew before the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.19'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come down against the city Desolation; and there was an exceedingly sore battle fought in the land Desolation, in the which they did beat the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.20'>And they fled again from before them, and they came to the city Boaz; and there they did stand against the Lamanites with exceeding boldness, insomuch that the Lamanites did not beat them until they had come again the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.21'>And when they had come the second time, the Nephites were driven and slaughtered with an exceedingly great slaughter; their women and their children were again sacrificed unto idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.22'>And it came to pass that the Nephites did again flee from before them, taking all the inhabitants with them, both in towns and villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.4.23'>And now I, Mormon, seeing that the Lamanites were about to overthrow the land, therefore I did go to the hill Shim, and did take up all the records which Ammaron had hid up unto the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.5.1'>AND it came to pass that I did go forth among the Nephites, and did repent of the oath which I had made that I would no more assist them; and they gave me command again of their armies, for they looked upon me as though I could deliver them from their afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.5.2'>But behold, I was without hope, for I knew the judgments of the Lord which should come upon them; for they repented not of their iniquities, but did struggle for their lives without calling upon that Being who created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.5.3'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did come against us as we had fled to the city of Jordan; but behold, they were driven back that they did not take the city at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.5.4'>And it came to pass that they came against us again, and we did maintain the city. And there were also other cities which were maintained by the Nephites, which strongholds did cut them off that they could not get into the country which lay before us, to destroy the inhabitants of our land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.5.5'>But it came to pass that whatsoever lands we had passed by, and the inhabitants thereof were not gathered in, were destroyed by the Lamanites, and their towns, and villages, and cities were burned with fire; and thus three hundred and seventy and nine years passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.5.6'>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and eightieth year the Lamanites did come again against us to battle, and we did stand against them boldly; but it was all in vain, for so great were their numbers that they did tread the people of the Nephites under their feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.5.7'>And it came to pass that we did again take to flight, and those whose flight was swifter than the Lamanites' did escape, and those whose flight did not exceed the Lamanites' were swept down and destroyed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.16'>Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in our eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend the marvelous works of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.17'>Who shall say that it was not a miracle that by his word the heaven and the earth should be; and by the power of his word man was created of the dust of the earth; and by the power of his word have miracles been wrought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.18'>And who shall say that Jesus Christ did not do many mighty miracles? And there were many mighty miracles wrought by the hands of the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.19'>And if there were miracles wrought then, why has God ceased to be a God of miracles and yet be an unchangeable Being? And behold, I say unto you he changeth not; if so he would cease to be God; and he ceaseth not to be God, and is a God of miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.20'>And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the children of men is because that they dwindle in unbelief, and depart from the right way, and know not the God in whom they should trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.21'>Behold, I say unto you that whoso believeth in Christ, doubting nothing, whatsoever he shall ask the Father in the name of Christ it shall be granted him; and this promise is unto all, even unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.22'>For behold, thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his disciples who should tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples, in the hearing of the multitude: Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.23'>And he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved, but he that believeth not shall be damned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.24'>And these signs shall follow them that believe-in my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.25'>And whosoever shall believe in my name, doubting nothing, unto him will I confirm all my words, even unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.26'>And now, behold, who can stand against the works of the Lord? Who can deny his sayings? Who will rise up against the almighty power of the Lord? Who will despise the works of the Lord? Who will despise the children of Christ? Behold, all ye who are despisers of the works of the Lord, for ye shall wonder and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.27'>O then despise not, and wonder not, but hearken unto the words of the Lord, and ask the Father in the name of Jesus for what things soever ye shall stand in need. Doubt not, but be believing, and begin as in times of old, and come unto the Lord with all your heart, and work out your own salvation with fear and trembling before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.28'>Be wise in the days of your probation; strip yourselves of all uncleanness; ask not, that ye may consume it on your lusts, but ask with a firmness unshaken, that ye will yield to no temptation, but that ye will serve the true and living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.29'>See that ye are not baptized unworthily; see that ye partake not of the sacrament of Christ unworthily; but see that ye do all things in worthiness, and do it in the name of Jesus Christ, the Son of the living God; and if ye do this, and endure to the end, ye will in nowise be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.30'>Behold, I speak unto you as though I spake from the dead; for I know that ye shall have my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.31'>Condemn me not because of mine imperfection, neither my father, because of his imperfection, neither them who have written before him; but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that ye may learn to be more wise than we have been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.32'>And now, behold, we have written this record according to our knowledge, in the characters which are called among us the reformed Egyptian, being handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.33'>And if our plates had been sufficiently large we should have written in Hebrew; but the Hebrew hath been altered by us also; and if we could have written in Hebrew, behold, ye would have had no imperfection in our record.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.34'>But the Lord knoweth the things which we have written, and also that none other people knoweth our language; and because that none other people knoweth our language, therefore he hath prepared means for the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.35'>And these things are written that we may rid our garments of the blood of our brethren, who have dwindled in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.36'>And behold, these things which we have desired concerning our brethren, yea, even their restoration to the knowledge of Christ, are according to the prayers of all the saints who have dwelt in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.37'>And may the Lord Jesus Christ grant that their prayers may be answered according to their faith; and may God the Father remember the covenant which he hath made with the house of Israel; and may he bless them forever, through faith on the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.</verse>
