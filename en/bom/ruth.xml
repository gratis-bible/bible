        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is God’s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Ruth'>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.1'>AND now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.2'>And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.3'>And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.4'>For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.5'>I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.6'>O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.7'>And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.8'>And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.9'>And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of teaching his sons, that he waxed old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.10'>Therefore, *he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this people, whom the Lord our God hath given us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.11'>And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.12'>And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out, except it be through transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.13'>Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored people of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become weak like unto their brethren; and he will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.14'>For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.15'>And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of these sayings to his son, that he gave him charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.16'>And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the plates of Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.17'>Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor progress in their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.18'>And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his father had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the people who were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather themselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words which his father should speak unto them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.1'>AND it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the land, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.2'>And there were a great number, even so many that they did not number them; for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.3'>And they also took of the firstlings of their flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the law of Moses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.4'>And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had appointed just men to be their teachers, and also a just man to be their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the commandments of God, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.5'>And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.6'>And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.7'>For the multitude being so great that king Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of the temple, therefore he caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.8'>And it came to pass that he began to speak to his people from the tower; and they could not all hear his words because of the greatness of the multitude; therefore he caused that the words which he spake should be written and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also receive his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.9'>And these are the words which he spake and caused to be written, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.10'>I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.11'>But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.12'>I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.13'>Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.14'>And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne-and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.15'>Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might boast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can answer a clear conscience before God this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.16'>Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.17'>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.18'>Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to serve one another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.19'>And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king, who has spent his days in your service, and yet has been in the service of God, do merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your heavenly King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.20'>I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.21'>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another-I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.22'>And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.23'>And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.24'>And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.25'>And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.26'>And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust. And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.27'>Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.28'>I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.29'>And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.30'>For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.31'>And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done. As ye have kept my commandments, and also the commandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.32'>But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.33'>For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.34'>I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are; and also have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.35'>And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.36'>And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.37'>I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.38'>Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.39'>And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.40'>O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.41'>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.1'>AND again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.2'>And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he stood before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.3'>And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.4'>For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.5'>For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.6'>And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.7'>And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.8'>And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.9'>And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.10'>And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.11'>For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.12'>But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against God! For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.13'>And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he had already come among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.14'>Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.15'>And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing except it were through the atonement of his blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.16'>And even if it were possible that little children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.17'>And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.18'>For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.19'>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.20'>And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come when the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.21'>And behold, when that time cometh, none shall be found blameless before God, except it be little children, only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.22'>And even at this time, when thou shalt have taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, even then are they found no more blameless in the sight of God, only according to the words which I have spoken unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.23'>And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.24'>And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright testimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof they shall be judged, every man according to his works, whether they be good, or whether they be evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.25'>And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have drunk damnation to their own souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.26'>Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have claim on them no more forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.27'>And their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever. Thus hath the Lord commanded me. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.1'>AND now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.2'>And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.3'>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.4'>And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak unto them, saying: My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my people, I would again call your attention, that ye may hear and understand the remainder of my words which I shall speak unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.5'>For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.6'>I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.7'>I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.8'>And this is the means whereby salvation cometh. And there is none other salvation save this which hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions which I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.9'>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.10'>And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.11'>And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.12'>And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.13'>And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that which is his due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.14'>And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.15'>But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.16'>And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.17'>Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.18'>But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.19'>For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.20'>And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a remission of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.21'>And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.22'>And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just will be your condemnation for withholding your substance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing which thou hast done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.23'>I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall perish with him; and now, I say these things unto those who are rich as pertaining to the things of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.24'>And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.25'>And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.26'>And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you-that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God-I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.27'>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.28'>And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.29'>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.30'>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.1'>AND now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his people if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.2'>And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.3'>And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.6'>And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.7'>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.8'>And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.9'>And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.10'>And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be called by some other name; therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.11'>And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the name that I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.12'>I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.13'>For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.14'>And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be among you if ye know not the name by which ye are called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.15'>Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all.

        <verse osisID='Ruth.6.2'>And it came to pass that there was not one soul, except it were little children, but who had entered into the covenant and had taken upon them the name of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.6.3'>And again, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of all these things, and had consecrated his son Mosiah to be a ruler and a king over his people, and had given him all the charges concerning the kingdom, and also had appointed priests to teach the people, that thereby they might hear and know the commandments of God, and to stir them up in remembrance of the oath which they had made, he dismissed the multitude, and they returned, every one, according to their families, to their own houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.6.4'>And Mosiah began to reign in his father's stead. *And he began to reign in the thirtieth year of his age, making in the whole, about four hundred and seventy-six years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.6.6'>And it came to pass that king Mosiah did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe his judgments and his statutes, and did keep his commandments in all things whatsoever he commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.6.7'>And king Mosiah did cause his people that they should till the earth. And he also, himself, did till the earth, that thereby he might not become burdensome to his people, that he might do according to that which his father had done in all things. And there was no contention among all his people for the space of three years.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.1'>AND now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.2'>And it came to pass that *king Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.3'>And it came to pass that on the morrow they started to go up, having with them one Ammon, he being a strong and mighty man, and a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was also their leader.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.4'>And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the wilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they wander.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.5'>And when they had wandered forty days they came to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.6'>And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.7'>And behold, they met the king of the people who were in the land of Nephi, and in the land of Shilom; and they were surrounded by the king's guard, and were taken, and were bound, and were committed to prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.8'>And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were again brought before the king, and their bands were loosed; and they stood before the king, and were permitted, or rather commanded, that they should answer the questions which he should ask them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.9'>And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.10'>And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.11'>And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have caused that my guards should have put you to death. Ye are permitted to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.12'>And now, when Ammon saw that he was permitted to speak, he went forth and bowed himself before the king; and rising again he said: O king, I am very thankful before God this day that I am yet alive, and am permitted to speak; and I will endeavor to speak with boldness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.13'>For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these bands. For I am Ammon, and am a descendant of Zarahemla, and have come up out of the land of Zarahemla to inquire concerning our brethren, whom Zeniff brought up out of that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.14'>And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive. And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.15'>For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne. And now, behold, our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.16'>And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon nor his brethren, but caused that they should go to the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest themselves from the labors of their journey; for they had suffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.17'>And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather themselves together to the temple, to hear the words which he should speak unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.18'>And it came to pass that when they had gathered themselves together that he spake unto them in this wise, saying: O ye, my people, lift up your heads and be comforted; for behold, the time is at hand, or is not far distant, when we shall no longer be in subjection to our enemies, notwithstanding our many strugglings, which have been in vain; yet I trust there remaineth an effectual struggle to be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.19'>Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.20'>And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even until now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.21'>And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.22'>And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection or into bondage. And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.23'>And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our affliction, great? Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.24'>Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.25'>For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon them. But behold, they would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among them, even so much that they did shed blood among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.26'>And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.27'>And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and said that he should take upon him the image of man, and it should be the image after which man was created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was created after the image of God, and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.28'>And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and many more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God upon them. Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.29'>For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.30'>And again, he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the chaff thereof in the whirlwind; and the effect thereof is poison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.31'>And again he saith: If my people shall sow filthiness they shall reap the east wind, which bringeth immediate destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.32'>And now, behold, the promise of the Lord is fulfilled, and ye are smitten and afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.33'>But if ye will turn to the Lord with full purpose of heart, and put your trust in him, and serve him with all diligence of mind, if ye do this, he will, according to his own will and pleasure, deliver you out of bondage.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.1'>AND it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.2'>And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude, and rehearse unto them all that had happened unto their brethren from the time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time that he himself came up out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.3'>And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king Benjamin had taught them, and explained them to the people of king Limhi, so that they might understand all the words which he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.4'>And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return every one unto his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.5'>And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the record of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.6'>Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could interpret languages, and Ammon told him that he could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.7'>And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.8'>And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.9'>And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.10'>And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are large, and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.11'>And again, they have brought swords, the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates. Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.12'>And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate? For I am desirous that these records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.13'>Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.14'>And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.15'>And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.16'>And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.17'>But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.18'>Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.19'>And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.20'>O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.1'>I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of the land of our fathers' first inheritance, *and having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them-but when I saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.2'>Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness, for I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he being an austere and a blood-thirsty man commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.3'>And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.4'>Nevertheless, after many days' wandering in the wilderness we pitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain, which was near to the land of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.5'>And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men into the city, in unto the king, that I might know of the disposition of the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my people and possess the land in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.6'>And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I might possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.7'>And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the land, and I and my people went into the land that we might possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.8'>And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of the city, yea, even the walls of the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.9'>And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with neas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and we did begin to multiply and prosper in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.10'>Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to bring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we might possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.11'>Therefore it came to pass, that after we had dwelt in the land for the space of *twelve years that king Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any means my people should wax strong in the land, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.12'>Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they were desirous to bring us into bondage, that they might glut themselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might feast themselves upon the flocks of our fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.13'>Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began to stir up his people that they should contend with my people; therefore there began to be wars and contentions in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.14'>For, in the *thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of Shilom, when my people were watering and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.15'>Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not overtaken, even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for protection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.16'>And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and my people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.17'>Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle against the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to the Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.18'>And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them out of our land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.19'>And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their dead. And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two hundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.1'>AND it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace.

        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.2'>And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.3'>And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our fathers for many years, yea, *for the space of twenty and two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.4'>And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all manner of grain and all manner of fruit of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.5'>And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and cloth of every kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land-thus we did have continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.6'>And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son began to reign in his stead. And he began to stir his people up in rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to come up to battle against my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.7'>But I had sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon, that I might discover their preparations, that I might guard against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.8'>And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men armed with bows, and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle about their loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.9'>And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children of my people should be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place them in their ranks, every man according to his age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.10'>And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did go up in the strength of the Lord to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.11'>Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.12'>They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this-Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.13'>And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord-therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.14'>And his brethren were wroth with him because they understood not the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.15'>And again, they were wroth with him when they had arrived in the promised land, because they said that he had taken the ruling of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.16'>And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into the wilderness as the Lord had commanded him, and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he robbed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.17'>And thus they have taught their children that they should hate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.18'>For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy them; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.19'>And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.1'>AND now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.2'>For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.3'>And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a fifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of their ziff, and of their copper, and of their brass and their iron; and a fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth part of all their grain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.7'>Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were deceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and priests; for they did speak flattering things unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.8'>And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of wood, and of all manner of precious things, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.9'>And he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented with gold and silver and with precious things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.10'>And he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of fine work within the walls of the temple, of fine wood, and of copper, and of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.11'>And the seats which were set apart for the high priests, which were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that they might rest their bodies and their arms upon while they should speak lying and vain words to his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.12'>And it came to pass that he built a tower near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of Shemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.13'>And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built in the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on the hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for the children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.14'>And it came to pass that he placed his heart upon his riches, and he spent his time in riotous living with his wives and his concubines; and so did also his priests spend their time with harlots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.15'>And it came to pass that he planted vineyards round about in the land; and he built wine-presses, and made wine in abundance; and therefore he became a wine-bibber, and also his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.16'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites began to come in upon his people, upon small numbers, and to slay them in their fields, and while they were tending their flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.17'>And king Noah sent guards round about the land to keep them off; but he did not send a sufficient number, and the Lamanites came upon them and killed them, and drove many of their flocks out of the land; thus the Lamanites began to destroy them, and to exercise their hatred upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.18'>And it came to pass that king Noah sent his armies against them, and they were driven back, or they drove them back for a time; therefore, they returned rejoicing in their spoil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.20'>And it came to pass that there was a man among them whose name was Abinadi; *and he went forth among them, and began to prophesy, saying: Behold, thus saith the Lord, and thus hath he commanded me, saying, Go forth, and say unto this people, thus saith the Lord-Wo be unto this people, for I have seen their abominations, and their wickedness, and their whoredoms; and except they repent I will visit them in mine anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.21'>And except they repent and turn to the Lord their God, behold, I will deliver them into the hands of their enemies; yea, and they shall be brought into bondage; and they shall be afflicted by the hand of their enemies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.26'>Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his life; but the Lord delivered him out of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.27'>Now when king Noah had heard of the words which Abinadi had spoken unto the people, he was also wroth; and he said: Who is Abinadi, that I and my people should be judged of him, or who is the Lord, that shall bring upon my people such great affliction?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.28'>I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him, for he has said these things that he might stir up my people to anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people; therefore I will slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.29'>Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore they hardened their hearts against the words of Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him.

        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.8'>And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.9'>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.10'>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.11'>And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.12'>And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.13'>And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.14'>And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.15'>And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into the water, and baptized him according to the first, only he did not bury himself again in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.16'>And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.17'>And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.18'>And it came to pass that Alma, having authority from God, ordained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.19'>And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.20'>Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.21'>And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.22'>And thus he commanded them to preach. And thus they became the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.23'>And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.24'>And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had ordained should labor with their own hands for their support.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.25'>And there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together to teach the people, and to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to assemble themselves together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.26'>And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of God, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the knowledge of God, that they might teach with power and authority from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.27'>And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.28'>And thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.29'>And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.30'>And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.31'>And these things were done in the borders of the land, that they might not come to the knowledge of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.32'>But behold, it came to pass that the king, having discovered a movement among the people, sent his servants to watch them. Therefore on the day that they were assembling themselves together to hear the word of the Lord they were discovered unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.33'>And now the king said that Alma was stirring up the people to rebellion against him; therefore he sent his army to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.34'>And it came to pass that Alma and the people of the Lord were apprised of the coming of the king's army; therefore they took their tents and their families and departed into the wilderness.</verse>

Behold, my people have not broken the oath that I made unto you; therefore, why should ye break the oath which ye made unto my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.20.15'>And now the king said: I have broken the oath because thy people did carry away the daughters of my people; therefore, in my anger I did cause my people to come up to war against thy people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.31'>Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not whither they had fled. Now they would have gladly joined with them, for they themselves had entered into a covenant with God to serve him and keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.32'>And now since the coming of Ammon, king Limhi had also entered into a covenant with God, and also many of his people, to serve him and keep his commandments.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.34'>Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a church, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord. Now they were desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.35'>They were desirous to be baptized as a witness and a testimony that they were willing to serve God with all their hearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time; and an account of their baptism shall be given hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.36'>And now all the study of Ammon and his people, and king Limhi and his people, was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the Lamanites and from bondage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.22'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.1'>AND now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to consult with the people how they should deliver themselves out of bondage; and even they did cause that all the people should gather themselves together; and this they did that they might have the voice of the people concerning the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.2'>And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver themselves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and children, and their flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and depart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so numerous, it was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them, thinking to deliver themselves out of bondage by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.3'>Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and stood before the king, and said unto him: Now O king, thou hast hitherto hearkened unto my words many times when we have been contending with our brethren, the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.4'>And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be an unprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even so I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time, and I will be thy servant and deliver this people out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.5'>And the king granted unto him that he might speak. And Gideon said unto him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.6'>Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of the city. The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by night are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.7'>And I will go according to thy command and pay the last tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and we will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp when they are drunken and asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.8'>Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our flocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel around the land of Shilom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.9'>And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of Gideon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.10'>And king Limhi caused that his people should gather their flocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto them; and they did drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.11'>And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart by night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds, and they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.12'>And they had taken all their gold, and silver, and their precious things, which they could carry, and also their provisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.13'>And after being many days in the wilderness they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah's people, and became his subjects.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.14'>And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and he also received their records, and also the records which had been found by the people of Limhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.15'>And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the people of Limhi had departed out of the land by night, that they sent an army into the wilderness to pursue them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.16'>And after they had pursued them two days, they could no longer follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in the wilderness.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.23'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.1'>NOW Alma, having been warned of the Lord that the armies of king Noah would come upon them, and having made it known to his people, therefore they gathered together their flocks, and took of their grain, and departed into the wilderness before the armies of king Noah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.2'>And the Lord did strengthen them, that the people of king Noah could not overtake them to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.3'>And they fled eight days' journey into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.4'>And they came to a land, yea, even a very beautiful and pleasant land, a land of pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.5'>And they pitched their tents, and began to till the ground, and began to build buildings; yea, they were industrious, and did labor exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.6'>And the people were desirous that Alma should be their king, for he was beloved by his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.7'>But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye should have a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.8'>Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could always have just men to be your kings it would be well for you to have a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.9'>But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his priests; and I myself was caught in a snare, and did many things which were abominable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore repentance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.10'>Nevertheless, after much tribulation, the Lord did hear my cries, and did answer my prayers, and has made me an instrument in his hands in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.11'>Nevertheless, in this I do not glory, for I am unworthy to glory of myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.12'>And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.13'>And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.14'>And also trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.15'>Thus did Alma teach his people, that every man should love his neighbor as himself, that there should be no contention among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.16'>And now, Alma was their high priest, he being the founder of their church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.17'>And it came to pass that none received authority to preach or to teach except it were by him from God. Therefore he consecrated all their priests and all their teachers; and none were consecrated except they were just men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.18'>Therefore they did watch over their people, and did nourish them with things pertaining to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.19'>And it came to pass that they began to prosper exceedingly in the land; and they called the land Helam.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.24'>And it came to pass that he did deliver them, and he did show forth his mighty power unto them, and great were their rejoicings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.25'>For behold, it came to pass that while they were in the land of Helam, yea, in the city of Helam, while tilling the land round about, behold an army of the Lamanites was in the borders of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.26'>Now it came to pass that the brethren of Alma fled from their fields, and gathered themselves together in the city of Helam; and they were much frightened because of the appearance of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.27'>But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened, but that they should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.28'>Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they would spare them, and their wives, and their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.29'>And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites. And Alma and his brethren went forth and delivered themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession of the land of Helam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.30'>Now the armies of the Lamanites, which had followed after the people of king Limhi, had been lost in the wilderness for many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.31'>And behold, they had found those priests of king Noah, in a place which they called Amulon; and they had begun to possess the land of Amulon and had begun to till the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.32'>Now the name of the leader of those priests was Amulon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.33'>And it came to pass that Amulon did plead with the Lamanites; and he also sent forth their wives, who were the daughters of the Lamanites, to plead with their brethren, that they should not destroy their husbands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.34'>And the Lamanites had compassion on Amulon and his brethren, and did not destroy them, because of their wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.35'>And Amulon and his brethren did join the Lamanites, and they were traveling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi when they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.36'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and his brethren, that if they would show them the way which led to the land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and their liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.37'>But after Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of Nephi the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set guards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.38'>And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a part of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with them the wives and the children of the guards who had been left in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.39'>And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the land of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do anything contrary to the will of the king of the Lamanites.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.24'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.1'>AND it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed teachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the land of Amulon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.2'>For the Lamanites had taken possession of all these lands; therefore, the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over all these lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.3'>And now the name of the king of the Lamanites was Laman, being called after the name of his father; and therefore he was called king Laman. And he was king over a numerous people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.4'>And he appointed teachers of the brethren of Amulon in every land which was possessed by his people; and thus the language of Nephi began to be taught among all the people of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.5'>And they were a people friendly one with another; nevertheless they knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them anything concerning the Lord their God, neither the law of Moses; nor did they teach them the words of Abinadi;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.6'>But they taught them that they should keep their record, and that they might write one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.7'>And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began to trade one with another and wax great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were among their own brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.8'>And now it came to pass that Amulon began to exercise authority over Alma and his brethren, and began to persecute him, and cause that his children should persecute their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.9'>For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king's priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth with him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put task-masters over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.10'>And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.11'>And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he put guards over them to watch them, that whosoever should be found calling upon God should be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.12'>And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.13'>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.14'>And I will also ease the burdens which are put upon your shoulders, that even you cannot feel them upon your backs, even while you are in bondage; and this will I do that ye may stand as witnesses for me hereafter, and that ye may know of a surety that I, the Lord God, do visit my people in their afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.15'>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.16'>And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.17'>And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go before this people, and I will go with thee and deliver this people out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.18'>Now it came to pass that Alma and his people in the night-time gathered their flocks together, and also of their grain; yea, even all the night-time were they gathering their flocks together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.19'>And in the morning the Lord caused a deep sleep to come upon the Lamanites, yea, and all their task-masters were in a profound sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.20'>And Alma and his people departed into the wilderness; and when they had traveled all day they pitched their tents in a valley, and they called the valley Alma, because he led their way in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.21'>Yea, and in the valley of Alma they poured out their thanks to God because he had been merciful unto them, and eased their burdens, and had delivered them out of bondage; for they were in bondage, and none could deliver them except it were the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.22'>And they gave thanks to God, yea, all their men and all their women and all their children that could speak lifted their voices in the praises of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.23'>And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and get thou and this people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will stop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in pursuit of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.24'>And it came to pass that they departed out of the valley, and took their journey into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.25'>And after they had been in the wilderness twelve days *they arrived in the land of Zarahemla; and king Mosiah did also receive them with joy.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.25'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.1'>AND now king Mosiah caused that all the people should be gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.2'>Now there were not so many of the children of Nephi, or so many of those who were descendants of Nephi, as there were of the people of Zarahemla, who was a descendant of Mulek, and those who came with him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.3'>And there were not so many of the people of Nephi and of the people of Zarahemla as there were of the Lamanites; yea, they were not half so numerous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.4'>And now all the people of Nephi were assembled together, and also all the people of Zarahemla, and they were gathered together in two bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.5'>And it came to pass that Mosiah did read, and caused to be read, the records of Zeniff to his people; yea, he read the records of the people of Zeniff, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until they returned again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.6'>And he also read the account of Alma and his brethren, and all their afflictions, from the time they left the land of Zarahemla until the time they returned again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.7'>And now, when Mosiah had made an end of reading the records, his people who tarried in the land were struck with wonder and amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.8'>For they knew not what to think; for when they beheld those that had been delivered out of bondage they were filled with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.9'>And again, when they thought of their brethren who had been slain by the Lamanites they were filled with sorrow, and even shed many tears of sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.10'>And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites and of bondage, they did raise their voices and give thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.11'>And again, when they thought upon the Lamanites, who were their brethren, of their sinful and polluted state, they were filled with pain and anguish for the welfare of their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.12'>And it came to pass that those who were the children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the daughters of the Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those who were called Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.13'>And now all the people of Zarahemla were numbered with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but those who were descendants of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.14'>And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should also speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.15'>And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled together in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.16'>And he did exhort the people of Limhi and his brethren, all those that had been delivered out of bondage, that they should remember that it was the Lord that did deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.17'>And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people many things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king Limhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people were desirous that they might be baptized also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.18'>Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.19'>And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that he might establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.20'>Now this was done because there were so many people that they could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God in one assembly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.21'>Therefore they did assemble themselves together in different bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.22'>And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were all one church, yea, even the church of God; for there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.23'>And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.24'>And they were called the people of God. And the Lord did pour out his Spirit upon them, and they were blessed, and prospered in the land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.26'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.1'>NOW it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.2'>They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.3'>And now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.4'>And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the church. And they were a separate people as to their faith, and remained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state; for they would not call upon the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.5'>And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous as the people of God; but because of the dissensions among the brethren they became more numerous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.6'>For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their flattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.7'>And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests, and delivered up unto the priests by the teachers; and the priests brought them before Alma, who was the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.8'>Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.9'>And it came to pass that Alma did not know concerning them; but there were many witnesses against them; yea, the people stood and testified of their iniquity in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.10'>Now there had not any such thing happened before in the church; therefore Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.11'>And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have brought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and they have been taken in divers iniquities. And they do not repent of their iniquities; therefore we have brought them before thee, that thou mayest judge them according to their crimes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.12'>But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge them not; therefore I deliver them into thy hands to be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.13'>And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this matter, for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.14'>And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole soul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.15'>Blessed art thou, Alma, and blessed are they who were baptized in the waters of Mormon. Thou art blessed because of thy exceeding faith in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.16'>And blessed are they because of their exceeding faith in the words alone which thou hast spoken unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.17'>And blessed art thou because thou hast established a church among this people; and they shall be established, and they shall be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.18'>Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name; for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.22'>For behold, this is my church; whosoever is baptized shall be baptized unto repentance. And whomsoever ye receive shall believe in my name; and him will I freely forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.23'>For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is I that hath created them; and it is I that granteth unto him that believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.27'>And then I will confess unto them that I never knew them; and they shall depart into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.28'>Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I will not receive at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.29'>Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.30'>Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.31'>And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses; for verily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor's trespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.32'>Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered among my people; and this shall be observed from this time forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.33'>And it came to pass when Alma had heard these words he wrote them down that he might have them, and that he might judge the people of that church according to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.34'>And it came to pass that Alma went and judged those that had been taken in iniquity, according to the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.35'>And whosoever repented of their sins and did confess them, them he did number among the people of the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.36'>And those that would not confess their sins and repent of their iniquity, the same were not numbered among the people of the church, and their names were blotted out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.37'>And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of the church; and they began again to have peace and to prosper exceedingly in the affairs of the church, walking circumspectly before God, receiving many, and baptizing many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.38'>And now all these things did Alma and his fellow laborers do who were over the church, walking in all diligence, teaching the word of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being persecuted by all those who did not belong to the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.39'>And they did admonish their brethren; and they were also admonished, every one by the word of God, according to his sins, or to the sins which he had committed, being commanded of God to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.27'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.1'>AND now it came to pass that the persecutions which were inflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma. And Alma laid the case before their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah consulted with his priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.2'>And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the land round about that there should not any unbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.3'>And there was a strict command throughout all the churches that there should be no persecutions among them, that there should be an equality among all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.4'>That they should let no pride nor haughtiness disturb their peace; that every man should esteem his neighbor as himself, laboring with their own hands for their support.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.5'>Yea, and all their priests and teachers should labor with their own hands for their support, in all cases save it were in sickness, or in much want; and doing these things, they did abound in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.6'>And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the people began to be very numerous, and began to scatter abroad upon the face of the earth, yea, on the north and on the south, on the east and on the west, building large cities and villages in all quarters of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.7'>And the Lord did visit them and prosper them, and they became a large and wealthy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.8'>Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.9'>And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.10'>And now it came to pass that while he was going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.11'>And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.12'>And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.13'>Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.14'>And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.15'>And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God? For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth? And can ye not also behold me before you? And I am sent from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.16'>Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in bondage, and he has delivered them. And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.17'>And now it came to pass that these were the last words which the angel spake unto Alma, and he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.18'>And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the earth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.19'>And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.20'>And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.21'>And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together that they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for those that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.22'>And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might receive their strength-that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.23'>And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.24'>For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.25'>And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.26'>And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.27'>I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.28'>Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.29'>My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.30'>I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.31'>Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.32'>And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.33'>But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.34'>And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.35'>And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.36'>And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.37'>And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.28'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.1'>NOW it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, *they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.2'>That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.3'>Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.4'>And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.5'>And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.6'>And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.7'>And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.8'>And it came to pass that Mosiah granted that they might go and do according to their request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.9'>And they took their journey into the wilderness to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an account of their proceedings hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.10'>Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who would accept of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.11'>Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and all the things which he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of God, after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the plates of gold which had been found by the people of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.12'>And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people; for they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those people who had been destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.13'>And now he translated them by the means of those two stones which were fastened into the two rims of a bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.14'>Now these things were prepared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.15'>And they have been kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he should discover to every creature who should possess the land the iniquities and abominations of his people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.16'>And whosoever has these things is called seer, after the manner of old times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.17'>Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records, behold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.18'>Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.19'>And this account shall be written hereafter; for behold, it is expedient that all people should know the things which are written in this account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.20'>And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.29'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.1'>NOW when Mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the land, among all the people, desiring to know their will concerning who should be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.2'>And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: We are desirous that Aaron thy son should be our king and our ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.3'>Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the sons of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.4'>Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the people; yea, even a written word sent he among the people. And these were the words that were written, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.5'>Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren, for I esteem you as such, I desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are called to consider-for ye are desirous to have a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.6'>Now I declare unto you that he to whom the kingdom doth rightly belong has declined, and will not take upon him the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.7'>And now if there should be another appointed in his stead, behold I fear there would rise contentions among you. And who knoweth but what my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn to be angry and draw away a part of this people after him, which would cause wars and contentions among you, which would be the cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the Lord, yea, and destroy the souls of many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.8'>Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider these things, for we have no right to destroy my son, neither should we have any right to destroy another if he should be appointed in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.9'>And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to commit much sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.10'>And now let us be wise and look forward to these things, and do that which will make for the peace of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.11'>Therefore I will be your king the remainder of my days; nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this people according to our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of this people, for we will appoint wise men to be judges, that will judge this people according to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.12'>Now it is better that a man should be judged of God than of man, for the judgments of God are always just, but the judgments of man are not always just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.13'>Therefore, if it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings, who would establish the laws of God, and judge this people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did for this people-I say unto you, if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.14'>And even I myself have labored with all the power and faculties which I have possessed, to teach you the commandments of God, and to establish peace throughout the land, that there should be no wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering, nor murdering, nor any manner of iniquity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.15'>And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have I punished according to the crime which he has committed, according to the law which has been given to us by our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.16'>Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is not expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.17'>For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked king cause to be committed, yea, and what great destruction!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.18'>Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations, and also the wickedness and abominations of his people. Behold what great destruction did come upon them; and also because of their iniquities they were brought into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.19'>And were it not for the interposition of their all-wise Creator, and this because of their sincere repentance, they must unavoidably remain in bondage until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.20'>But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.21'>And behold, now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous king save it be through much contention, and the shedding of much blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.22'>For behold, he has his friends in iniquity, and he keepeth his guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned in righteousness before him; and he trampleth under his feet the commandments of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.23'>And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his people, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.24'>And now behold I say unto you, it is not expedient that such abominations should come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.25'>Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers, which are correct, and which were given them by the hand of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.26'>Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law-to do your business by the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.27'>And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.28'>And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.29'>If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.30'>And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord; and I command you to do these things, and that ye have no king; that if these people commit sins and iniquities they shall be answered upon their own heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.31'>For behold I say unto you, the sins of many people have been caused by the iniquities of their kings; therefore their iniquities are answered upon the heads of their kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.32'>And now I desire that this inequality should be no more in this land, especially among this my people; but I desire that this land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we may live and inherit the land, yea, even as long as any of our posterity remains upon the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.33'>And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them, unfolding unto them all the trials and troubles of a righteous king, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also all the murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained it all unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.34'>And he told them that these things ought not to be; but that the burden should come upon all the people, that every man might bear his part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.35'>And he also unfolded unto them all the disadvantages they labored under, by having an unrighteous king to rule over them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.36'>Yea, all his iniquities and abominations, and all the wars, and contentions, and bloodshed, and the stealing, and the plundering, and the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of iniquities which cannot be enumerated-telling them that these things ought not to be, that they were expressly repugnant to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.37'>And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had sent these things forth among the people they were convinced of the truth of his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.38'>Therefore they relinquished their desires for a king, and became exceedingly anxious that every man should have an equal chance throughout all the land; yea, and every man expressed a willingness to answer for his own sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.39'>Therefore, it came to pass that they assembled themselves together in bodies throughout the land, to cast in their voices concerning who should be their judges, to judge them according to the law which had been given them; and they were exceedingly rejoiced because of the liberty which had been granted unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.40'>And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon him as a tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre which doth corrupt the soul; for he had not exacted riches of them, neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but he had established peace in the land, and he had granted unto his people that they should be delivered from all manner of bondage; therefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.41'>And it came to pass that they did appoint judges to rule over them, or to judge them according to the law; and this they did throughout all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.42'>And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the first chief judge, he being also the high priest, his father having conferred the office upon him, and having given him the charge concerning all the affairs of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.43'>And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the ways of the Lord, and he did keep his commandments, and he did judge righteous judgments; and there was continual peace through the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.44'>And thus *commenced the reign of the judges throughout all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who were called the Nephites; and Alma was the first and chief judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.45'>And now it came to pass that his father died, being eighty and two years old, having lived to fulfil the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.46'>And it came to pass that Mosiah died also, in the thirty and third year of his reign, being sixty and three years old; making in the whole, five hundred and nine years from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.47'>And thus ended the reign of the kings over the people of Nephi; and thus ended the days of Alma, who was the founder of their church.</verse>
