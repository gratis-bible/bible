      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him nothing that exists came into being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In Him was Life, and that Life was the Light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>The Light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overpowered it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came as a witness, in order that he might give testimony concerning the Light–so that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the Light, but he existed that he might give testimony concerning the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true Light was that which illumines every man by its coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world came into existence through Him, and the world did not recognize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to the things that were His own, and His own people gave Him no welcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But all who have received Him, to them –that is, to those who trust in His name– He has given the privilege of becoming children of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were begotten as such not by human descent, nor through an impulse of their own nature, nor through the will of a human father, but from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word came in the flesh, and lived for a time in our midst, so that we saw His glory–the glory as of the Father's only Son, sent from His presence. He was full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John gave testimony concerning Him and cried aloud, saying, »This is He of whom I said, `He who is coming after me has been put before me,' for He was before me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>For He it is from whose fulness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No human eye has ever seen God: the only Son, who is in the Father's bosom–He has made Him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>This also is John's testimony, when the Jews sent to him a deputation of Priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him who he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He avowed–he did not conceal the truth, but avowed, »I am not the Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>»What then?« they inquired; »are you Elijah?«»I am not,« he said. »Are you the Prophet?«»No,« he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>So they pressed the question. »Who are you?« they said– »that we may take an answer to those who sent us. What account do you give of yourself?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>»I am the voice, he replied, of one crying aloud, `Make straight the Lord's way in the Desert,' fulfilling the words of the Prophet Isaiah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>They were Pharisees who had been sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>Again they questioned him. »Why then do you baptize,« they said, »if you are neither the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>»I baptize in water only,« John answered, »but in your midst stands One whom you do not know–</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He who is to come after me, and whose sandal-strap I am not worthy to unfasten.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This conversation took place at Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John saw Jesus coming towards him and exclaimed, »Look, that is the Lamb of God who is to take away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is He about whom I said, `After me is to come One who has been put before me, because He was before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I did not yet know Him; but that He may be openly shown to Israel is the reason why I have come baptizing in water.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John also gave testimony by stating: »I have seen the Spirit coming down like a dove out of Heaven; and it remained upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I did not yet know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water said to me, »`The One on whom you see the Spirit coming down, and remaining, He it is who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>»This I have seen, and I have become a witness that He is the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>when he saw Jesus passing by, and said, »Look! that is the Lamb of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples heard his exclamation, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned round, and seeing them following He asked them, »What is your wish?« »Rabbi,« they replied- `Rabbi' means `Teacher' »where are you staying?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>»Come and you shall see,« He said. So they went and saw where He was staying, and they remained and spent that day with Him. It was then about ten o'clock in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John's exclamation and followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, »We have found the Messiah!« –that is to say, the Anointed One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, »You are Simon, son of John: you shall be called Cephas« –that is to say, Peter (or `Rock').</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The next day, having decided to leave Bethany and go into Galilee, Jesus found Philip, and invited him to follow Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>(Now Philip came from Bethsaida, the same town as Andrew and Peter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Then Philip found Nathanael, and said to him, »We have found him about whom Moses in the Law wrote, as well as the Prophets–Jesus, the son of Joseph, a man of Nazareth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>»Can anything good come out of Nazareth?« replied Nathanael. »Come and see,« said Philip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael approaching, and said of him, »Look! here is a true Israelite, in whom there is no deceitfulness!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>»How do you know me?« Nathanael asked. »Before Philip called you,« said Jesus, »when you were under the fig-tree I saw you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>»Rabbi,« cried Nathanael, »you are the Son of God, you are Israel's King!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>»Because I said to you, `I saw you under the fig-tree,'« replied Jesus, »do you believe? You shall see greater things than that.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>»I tell you all in most solemn truth,« He added, »that you shall see Heaven opened wide, and God's angels going up, and coming down to the Son of Man.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>Two days later there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and Jesus also was invited and His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>Now the wine ran short; whereupon the mother of Jesus said to Him, »They have no wine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>»Leave the matter in my hands,« He replied; »the time for me to act has not yet come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the attendants, »Whatever he tells you to do, do it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six stone jars standing there (in accordance with the Jewish regulations for purification), each large enough to hold twenty gallons or more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to the attendants, »Fill the jars with water.« And they filled them to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>Then He said, »Now, take some out, and carry it to the President of the feast.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>So they carried some to him. And no sooner had the President tasted the water now turned into wine, than –not knowing where it came from, though the attendants who had drawn the water knew– he called to the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, »It is usual to put on the good wine first, and when people have drunk freely, then that which is inferior. But you have kept the good wine till now.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This, the first of His miracles, Jesus performed at Cana in Galilee, and thus displayed His glorious power; and His disciples believed in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>Afterwards He went down to Capernaum–He, and His mother, and His brothers, and His disciples; and they made a short stay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>But the Jewish Passover was approaching, and for this Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And He found in the Temple the dealers in cattle and sheep and in pigeons, and the money-changers sitting there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>So He plaited a whip of rushes, and drove all –both sheep and bullocks– out of the Temple. The small coin of the brokers He upset on the ground and overturned their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And to the pigeon-dealers He said, »Take these things away. Do not turn my Father's house into a market.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>This recalled to His disciples the words of Scripture, »My zeal for Thy House will consume me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>So the Jews asked Him, »What proof of your authority do you exhibit to us, seeing that you do these things?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>»Demolish this Sanctuary,« said Jesus, »and in three days I will rebuild it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>»It has taken forty-six years,« replied the Jews, »to build this Sanctuary, and will you rebuild it in three days?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But He was speaking of the Sanctuary of His body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When however He had risen from among the dead, His disciples recollected that He had said this; and they believed the Scripture and the teaching which Jesus had given them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when He was in Jerusalem, at the Festival of the Passover, many became believers in Him through watching the miracles He performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But for His part, Jesus did not trust Himself to them, because He knew them all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and did not need any one's testimony concerning a man, for He of Himself knew what was in the man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was one of the Pharisees whose name was Nicodemus–a ruler among the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>He came to Jesus by night and said, »Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher from God; for no one can do these miracles which you are doing, unless God is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« answered Jesus, »that unless a man is born anew he cannot see the Kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>»How is it possible,« Nicodemus asked, »for a man to be born when he is old? Can he a second time enter his mother's womb and be born?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the Kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>Whatever has been born of the flesh is flesh, and whatever has been born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not be astonished at my telling you, `You must all be born anew.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it chooses, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it is going. So is it with every one who has been born of the Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>»How is all this possible?« asked Nicodemus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>»Are you,« replied Jesus, »`the Teacher of Israel,' and yet do you not understand these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>In most solemn truth I tell you that we speak what we know, and give testimony of that of which we were eye-witnesses, and yet you all reject our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and none of you believe me, how will you believe me if I tell you of things in Heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>There is no one who has gone up to Heaven, but there is One who has come down from Heaven, namely the Son of Man whose home is in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And just as Moses lifted high the serpent in the Desert, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>in order that every one who trusts in Him may have the Life of the Ages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For so greatly did God love the world that He gave His only Son, that every one who trusts in Him may not perish but may have the Life of Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send His Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who trusts in Him does not come up for judgement. He who does not trust has already received sentence, because he has not his trust resting on the name of God's only Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the test by which men are judged–the Light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness more than they loved the Light, because their deeds were wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every wrongdoer hates the light, and does not come to the light, for fear his actions should be exposed and condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who does what is honest and right comes to the light, in order that his actions may be plainly shown to have been done in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this Jesus and His disciples went into Judaea; and there He made a stay in company with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John too was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there were many pools of water there; and people came and received baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>(For John was not yet in prison.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>As the result, a discussion having arisen on the part of John's disciples with a Jew about purification,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>they came to John and reported to him, »Rabbi, he who was with you on the other side of the Jordan and to whom you bore testimony is now baptizing, and great numbers of people are resorting to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>»A man cannot obtain anything,« replied John, »unless it has been granted to him from Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves can bear witness to my having said, `I am not the Christ,' but `I am His appointed forerunner.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; and the bridegroom's friend who stands by his side and listens to him, rejoices heartily on account of the bridegroom's happiness. Therefore this joy of mine is now complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must grow greater, but I must grow less.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all. He whose origin is from the earth is not only himself from the earth, his teaching also is from the earth. He who comes from Heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What He has seen and heard, to that He bears witness; but His testimony no one receives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>Any man who has received His testimony has solemnly declared that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For He whom God has sent speaks God's words; for God does not give the Spirit with limitations.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son and has entrusted everything to His hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes in the Son has the Life of the Ages; he who disobeys the Son will not enter into Life, but God's anger remains upon him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Now as soon as the Master was aware that the Pharisees had heard it said, »Jesus is gaining and baptizing more disciples than John«–</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>though Jesus Himself did not baptize them, but His disciples did–</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He left Judaea and returned to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>His road lay through Samaria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>and so He came to Sychar, a town in Samaria near the piece of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Jacob's Well was there: and accordingly Jesus, tired out with His journey, sat down by the well to rest. It was about six o'clock in the evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>Presently there came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus asked her to give Him some water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>for His disciples were gone to the town to buy provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>»How is it,« replied the woman, »that a Jew like you asks me, who am a woman and a Samaritan, for water?« (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>»If you had known God's free gift,« replied Jesus, »and who it is that said to you, `Give me some water,' you would have asked Him, and He would have given you living water.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>»Sir,« she said, »you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; so where can you get the living water from?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our forefather Jacob, who gave us the well, and himself drank from it, as did also his sons and his cattle?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>»Every one,« replied Jesus, »who drinks any of this water will be thirsty again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever drinks any of the water that I shall give him will never, never thirst. But the water that I shall give him will become a fountain within him of water springing up for the Life of the Ages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>»Sir,« said the woman, »give me that water, that I may never be thirsty, nor continually come all the way here to draw from the well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>»Go and call your husband,« said Jesus; »and come back.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>»I have no husband,« she replied. »You rightly say that you have no husband,« said Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>»for you have had five husbands, and the man you have at present is not your husband. You have spoken the truth in saying that.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>»Sir,« replied the woman, »I see that you are a Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our forefathers worshipped on this mountain, but you Jews say that the place where people must worship is in Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>»Believe me,« said Jesus, »the time is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship One of whom you know nothing. We worship One whom we know; for salvation comes from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But a time is coming –nay, has already come– when the true worshippers will worship the Father with true spiritual worship; for indeed the Father desires such worshippers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must bring Him true spiritual worship.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>»I know,« replied the woman, »that Messiah is coming–`the Christ,' as He is called. When He has come, He will tell us everything.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>»I am He,« said Jesus– »I who am now talking to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>Just then His disciples came, and were surprised to find Him talking with a woman. Yet not one of them asked Him, »What is your wish?« or »Why are you talking with her?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman however, leaving her pitcher, went away to the town, and called the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>»Come,« she said, »and see a man who has told me everything I have ever done. Can this be the Christ, do you think?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They left the town and set out to go to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Meanwhile the disciples were urging Jesus. »Rabbi,« they said, »eat something.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>»I have food to eat,« He replied, »of which you do not know.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>So the disciples began questioning one another. »Can it be,« they said, »that some one has brought Him something to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>»My food,« said Jesus, »is to be obedient to Him who sent me, and fully to accomplish His work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, `It wants four months yet to the harvest'? But look round, I tell you, and observe these plains– they are already ripe for the sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>The reaper gets pay and gathers in a crop in preparation for the Life of the Ages, that so the sower and the reapers may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For it is in this that you see the real meaning of the saying, `The sower is one person, and the reaper is another.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap a harvest which is not the result of your own labours. Others have laboured, and you are getting benefit from their labours.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Of the Samaritan population of that town a good many believed in Him because of the woman's statement when she declared, »He has told me all that I have ever done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>When however the Samaritans came to Him, they asked Him on all sides to stay with them; and He stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>Then a far larger number of people believed because of His own words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and they said to the woman, »We no longer believe in Him simply because of your statements; for we have now heard for ourselves, and we know that this man really is the Saviour of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After the two days He departed, and went into Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>though Jesus Himself declared that a Prophet has no honour in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>When however He reached Galilee, the Galilaeans welcomed Him eagerly, having been eye-witnesses of all that He had done in Jerusalem at the Festival; for they also had been to the Festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So He came once more to Cana in Galilee, where He had made the water into wine. Now there was a certain officer of the King's court whose son was ill at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>Having heard that Jesus had come from Judaea to Galilee, he came to Him and begged Him to go down and cure his son; for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>»Unless you and others see miracles and marvels,« said Jesus, »nothing will induce you to believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>»Sir,« pleaded the officer, »come down before my child dies.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>»You may return home,« replied Jesus; »your son has recovered.« He believed the words of Jesus, and started back home;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>and he was already on his way down when his servants met him and told him that his son was alive and well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he inquired of them at what hour he had shown improvement. »Yesterday, about seven o'clock,« they replied, »the fever left him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>Then the father recollected that that was the time at which Jesus had said to him, »Your son has recovered,« and he and his whole household became believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This is the second miracle that Jesus performed, after coming from Judaea into Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a Festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem near the Sheep Gate a pool, called in Hebrew `Bethesda.' It has five arcades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these there used to lie a great number of sick persons, and of people who were blind or lame or paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And there was one man there who had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus saw him lying there, and knowing that he had been a long time in that condition, He asked him, »Do you wish to have health and strength?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>»Sir,« replied the sufferer, »I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is moved; but while I am coming some one else steps down before me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>»Rise,« said Jesus, »take up your mat and walk.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>Instantly the man was restored to perfect health, and he took up his mat and began to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>That day was a Sabbath. So the Jews said to the man who had been cured, »It is the Sabbath: you must not carry your mat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>»He who cured me,« he replied, »said to me, `Take up your mat and walk.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>»Who is it,« they asked, »that said to you, `Take up your mat and walk'?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But the man who had been cured did not know who it was; for Jesus had passed out unnoticed, there being a crowd in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterwards Jesus found him in the Temple and said to him, »You are now restored to health. Do not sin any more, or a worse thing may befall you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had restored him to health;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>and on this account the Jews began to persecute Jesus–because He did these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>His reply to their accusation was, »My Father works unceasingly, and so do I.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>On this account then the Jews were all the more eager to put Him to death–because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also spoke of God as being in a special sense His Father, thus putting Himself on a level with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that the Son can do nothing of Himself–He can only do what He sees the Father doing; for whatever He does, that the Son does in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son and reveals to Him all that He Himself is doing. And greater deeds than these will He reveal to Him, in order that you may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For just as the Father awakens the dead and gives them life, so the Son also gives life to whom He wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>The Father indeed does not judge any one, but He has entrusted all judgement to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all may honour the Son even as they honour the Father. The man who withholds honour from the Son withholds honour from the Father who sent Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>»In most solemn truth I tell you that he who listens to my teaching and believes Him who sent me, has the Life of the Ages, and does not come under judgement, but has passed over out of death into Life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>»In most solemn truth I tell you that a time is coming –nay, has already come– when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has also given to the Son to have life in Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>And He has conferred on Him authority to act as Judge, because He is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Wonder not at this. For a time is coming when all who are in the graves will hear His voice and will come forth–</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>they who have done what is right to the resurrection of Life, and they whose actions have been evil to the resurrection of judgement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>»I can of my own self do nothing. As I am bidden, so I judge; and mine is a just judgement, because it is not my own will that guides me, but the will of Him who sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>»If I give testimony concerning myself, my testimony cannot be accepted.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is Another who gives testimony concerning me, and I know that the testimony is true which He offers concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>»You sent to John, and he both was and still is a witness to the truth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But the testimony on my behalf which I accept is not from man; though I say all this in order that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was the lamp that burned and shone, and for a time you were willing to be gladdened by his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>»But the testimony which I have is weightier than that of John; for the work the Father has assigned to me for me to bring it to completion –the very work which I am doing– affords testimony concerning me that the Father has sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who sent me, He has given testimony concerning me. None of you have ever either heard His voice or seen what He is like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>Nor have you His word dwelling within you, for you refuse to believe Him whom He has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>»You search the Scriptures, because you suppose that in them you will find the Life of the Ages; and it is those Scriptures that yield testimony concerning me;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>and yet you are unwilling to come to me that you may have Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>»I do not accept glory from man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>but I know you well, and I know that in your hearts you do not really love God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come as my Father's representative, and you do not receive me. If some one else comes representing only himself, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How is it possible for you to believe, while you receive glory from one another and have no desire for the glory that comes from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>»Do not suppose that I will accuse you to the Father. There is one who accuses you, namely Moses, on whom your hope rests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you believe Moses, you would believe me; for he wrote about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you disbelieve his writings, how are you to believe my words?«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After this Jesus went away across the Lake of Galilee (that is, the Lake of Tiberias).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>A vast multitude followed Him, because they witnessed the miracles on the sick which He was constantly performing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>Then Jesus went up the hill, and sat there with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>The Jewish Festival, the Passover, was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>And when He looked round and saw an immense crowd coming towards Him, He said to Philip, »Where shall we buy bread for all these people to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>He said this to put Philip to the test, for He Himself knew what He was going to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>»Seven pounds' worth of bread,« replied Philip, »is not enough for them all to get even a scanty meal.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>»There is a boy here with five barley loaves and a couple of fish: but what is that among so many?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>»Make the people sit down,« said Jesus. The ground was covered with thick grass; so they sat down, the adult men numbering about 5,000.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Then Jesus took the loaves, and after giving thanks He distributed them to those who were resting on the ground; and also the fish in like manner–as much as they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When all were fully satisfied, He said to His disciples, »Gather up the broken portions that remain over, so that nothing be lost.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>Accordingly they gathered them up; and with the fragments of the five barley loaves –the broken portions that remained over after they had done eating– they filled twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Thereupon the people, having seen the miracle He had performed, said, »This is indeed the Prophet who was to come into the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Perceiving, however, that they were about to come and carry Him off by force to make Him a king, Jesus withdrew again up the hill alone by Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>When evening came on, His disciples went down to the Lake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>There they got on board a boat, and pushed off to cross the Lake to Capernaum. By this time it had become dark, and Jesus had not yet joined them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>The Lake also was getting rough, because a strong wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>When, however, they had rowed three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the water and coming near the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>They were terrified; but He called to them. »It is I,« He said, »do not be afraid.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they were willing to take Him on board; and in a moment the boat reached the shore at the point to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>Next morning the crowd who were still standing about on the other side of the Lake found that there had been but one small boat there, and they had seen that Jesus did not go on board with His disciples, but that His disciples went away without Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>Yet a number of small boats came from Tiberias to the neighbourhood of the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>When however the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor His disciples were there, they themselves also took boats and came to Capernaum to look for Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>So when they had crossed the Lake and had found Him, they asked Him, »Rabbi, when did you come here?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that you are searching for me not because you have seen miracles, but because you ate the loaves and had a hearty meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Bestow your pains not on the food which perishes, but on the food that remains unto the Life of the Ages–that food which will be the Son of Man's gift to you; for on Him the Father, God, has set His seal.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>»What are we to do,« they asked, »in order to carry out the things that God requires?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>»This,« replied Jesus, »is above all the thing that God requires–that you should be believers in Him whom He has sent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>»What miracle then,« they asked, »do you perform for us to see and become believers in you? What do you do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, as it is written, `He gave them bread out of Heaven to eat'.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that Moses did not give you the bread out of Heaven, but my Father is giving you the bread –the true bread– out of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For God's bread is that which comes down out of Heaven and gives Life to the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>»Sir,« they said, »always give us that bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>»I am the bread of Life,« replied Jesus; »he who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never, never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But it is as I have said to you: you have seen me and yet you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>Every one whom the Father gives me will come to me, and him who comes to me I will never on any account drive away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I have left Heaven and have come down to earth not to seek my own pleasure, but to do the will of Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of Him who sent me, that of all that He has given me I should lose nothing, but should raise it to life on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>For this is my Father's will, that every one who fixes his gaze on the Son of God and believes in Him should have the Life of the Ages, and I will raise him to life on the last day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>Now the Jews began to find fault about Him because of His claiming to be the bread which came down out of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>They kept asking, »Is not this man Joseph's son? Is he not Jesus, whose father and mother we know? What does he mean by now saying, `I have come down out of Heaven'?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>»Do not thus find fault among yourselves,« replied Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>»no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; then I will raise him to life on the last day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It stands written in the Prophets, `And they shall all of them be taught by God'. Every one who listens to the Father and learns from Him comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>No one has ever seen the Father–except Him who is from God. He has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>»In most solemn truth I tell you that he who believes has the Life of the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your forefathers ate the manna in the Desert, and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>Here is the bread that comes down out of Heaven that a man may eat it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread come down out of Heaven. If a man eats this bread, he shall live for ever. Moreover the bread which I will give is my flesh given for the life of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>This led to an angry debate among the Jews. »How can this man,« they argued, »give us his flesh to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« said Jesus, »that unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no Life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has the Life of the Ages, and I will raise him up on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in union with me, and I remain in union with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the ever-living Father has sent me, and I live because of the Father, so also he who eats me will live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread which came down out of Heaven; it is unlike that which your forefathers ate–for they ate and yet died. He who eats this bread shall live for ever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>Jesus said all this in the synagogue while teaching at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many therefore of His disciples, when they heard it, said, »This is hard to accept. Who can listen to such teaching?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But, knowing in Himself that His disciples were dissatisfied about it, Jesus asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>»Does this seem incredible to you? What then if you were to see the Son of Man ascending again where He was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the spirit which gives Life. The flesh confers no benefit whatever. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and are Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe.« For Jesus knew from the beginning who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>So He added, »That is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>Thereupon many of His disciples left Him and went away, and no longer associated with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Jesus therefore appealed to the Twelve. »Will you go also?« He asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>»Master,« replied Simon Peter, »to whom shall we go? Your teachings tell us of the Life of the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we have come to believe and know that you are indeed the Holy One of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>»Did not I choose you–the Twelve?« said Jesus, »and even of you one is a devil.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He alluded to Judas, the son of Simon the Iscariot. For he it was who, though one of the Twelve, was afterwards to betray Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After this Jesus moved from place to place in Galilee. He would not go about in Judaea, because the Jews were seeking an opportunity to kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>But the Jewish Festival of the Tent-Pitching was approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>So His brothers said to Him, »Leave these parts and go into Judaea, that not only we but your disciples also may witness the miracles which you perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one acts in secret, desiring all the while to be himself known publicly. Since you are doing these things, show yourself openly to the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For even His brothers were not believers in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>»My time,« replied Jesus, »has not yet come, but for you any time is suitable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>It is impossible for the world to hate you; but me it does hate, because I give testimony concerning it that its conduct is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>As for you, go up to the Festival. I do not now go up to this Festival, because my time is not yet fully come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>Such was His answer, and He remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>When however His brothers had gone up to the Festival, then He also went up, not openly, but as it were privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>Meanwhile the Jews at the Festival were looking for Him and were inquiring, »Where is he?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>Among the mass of the people there was much muttered debate about Him. Some said, »He is a good man.« Others said, »Not so: he is imposing on the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke out boldly about Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>But when the Festival was already half over, Jesus went up to the Temple and commenced teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>The Jews were astonished. »How does this man know anything of books,« they said, »although he has never been at any of the schools?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus answered their question by saying, »My teaching does not belong to me, but comes from Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any one is willing to do His will, he shall know about the teaching, whether it is from God or originates with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>The man whose teaching originates with himself aims at his own glory. He who aims at the glory of Him who sent him teaches the truth, and there is no deception in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the Law? And yet not a man of you obeys the Law. Why do you want to kill me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>»You are possessed by a demon,« replied the crowd; »no one wants to kill you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>»One deed I have done,« replied Jesus, »and you are all full of wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Consider therefore. Moses gave you the rite of circumcision (not that it began with Moses, but with your earlier forefathers), and even on a Sabbath day you circumcise a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a child is circumcised even on a Sabbath day, are you bitter against me because I have restored a man to perfect health on a Sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not form superficial judgements, but form the judgements that are just.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Some however of the people of Jerusalem said, »Is not this the man they are wanting to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>But here he is, speaking openly and boldly, and they say nothing to him! Can the Rulers really have ascertained that this man is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>And yet we know this man, and we know where he is from; but as for the Christ, when He comes, no one can tell where He is from.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Jesus therefore, while teaching in the Temple, cried aloud, and said, »Yes, you know me, and you know where I am from. And yet I have not come of my own accord; but there is One who has sent me, an Authority indeed, of whom you have no knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know Him, because I came from Him, and He sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>On hearing this they wanted to arrest Him; yet not a hand was laid on Him, because His time had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>But from among the crowd a large number believed in Him. »When the Christ comes,« they said, »will He perform more miracles than this teacher has performed?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the people thus expressing their various doubts about Him, and the High Priests and the Pharisees sent some officers to apprehend Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>So Jesus said, »Still for a short time I am with you, and then I go my way to Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You will look for me and will not find me, and where I am you cannot come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews therefore said to one another, »Where is he about to betake himself, so that we shall not find him? Will he betake himself to the Dispersion among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What do those words of his mean, `You will look for me, but will not find me, and where I am you cannot come'?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>On the last day of the Festival –the great day– Jesus stood up and cried aloud. »Whoever is thirsty,« He said, »let him come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes in me, from within him –as the Scripture has said– rivers of living water shall flow.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>He referred to the Spirit which those who believed in Him were to receive; for the Spirit was not bestowed as yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>After listening to these discourses, some of the crowd began to say, »This is beyond doubt the Prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others said, »He is the Christ.« But others again, »Not so, for is the Christ to come from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Has not the Scripture declared that the Christ is to come of the family of David and from Bethlehem, David's village?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there was a violent dissension among the people on His account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>Some of them wanted at once to arrest Him, but no one laid hands upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>Meanwhile the officers returned to the High Priests and Pharisees, who asked them, »Why have you not brought him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>»No mere man has ever spoken as this man speaks,« said the officers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>»Are you deluded too?« replied the Pharisees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>»has any one of the Rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this rabble who understand nothing about the Law are accursed!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus interposed–he who had formerly gone to Jesus, being himself one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>»Does our Law,« he asked, »judge a man without first hearing what he has to say and ascertaining what his conduct is?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>»Do you also come from Galilee?« they asked in reply. »Search and see for yourself that no Prophet is of Galilaean origin.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>[So they went away to their several homes;</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>At break of day however He returned to the Temple, and there the people came to Him in crowds. He seated Himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>and was teaching them when the Scribes and the Pharisees brought to Him a woman who had been found committing adultery. They made her stand in the centre of the court, and they put the case to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>»Rabbi,« they said, »this woman has been found in the very act of committing adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now, in the Law, Moses has ordered us to stone such women to death. But what do you say?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>They asked this in order to put Him to the test, so that they might have some charge to bring against Him. But Jesus leant forward and began to write with His finger on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>When however they persisted with their question, He raised His head and said to them, »Let the sinless man among you be the first to throw a stone at her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>Then He leant forward again, and again began to write on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>They listened to Him, and then, beginning with the eldest, took their departure, one by one, till all were gone. And Jesus was left behind alone–and the woman in the centre of the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Then, raising His head, Jesus said to her, »Where are they? Has no one condemned you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>»No one, Sir,« she replied. »And I do not condemn you either,« said Jesus; »go, and from this time do not sin any more.«]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Once more Jesus addressed them. »I am the Light of the world,« He said; »the man who follows me shall certainly not walk in the dark, but shall have the light of Life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>»You are giving testimony about yourself,« said the Pharisees; »your testimony is not true.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>»Even if I am giving testimony about myself,« replied Jesus, »my testimony is true; for I know where I came from and where I am going, but you know neither of these two things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge according to appearances: I am judging no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>And even if I do judge, my judgement is just; for I am not alone, but the Father who sent me is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>In your own Law, too, it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I am one giving testimony about myself, and the Father who sent me gives testimony about me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>»Where is your Father?« they asked. »You know my Father as little as you know me.« He replied; »if you knew me, you would know my Father also.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>These sayings He uttered in the Treasury, while teaching in the Temple; yet no one arrested Him, because His time had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Again He said to them, »I am going away. Then you will try to find me, but you will die in your sins. Where I am going, it is impossible for you to come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>The Jews began to ask one another, »Is he going to kill himself, do you think, that he says, `Where I am going, it is impossible for you to come'?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>»You,« He continued, »are from below, I am from above: you are of this present world, I am not of this present world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>That is why I told you that you will die in your sins; for, unless you believe that I am He, that is what will happen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>»You–who are you?« they asked. »How is it that I am speaking to you at all?« replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>»Many things I have to speak and to judge concerning you. But He who sent me is true, and the things which I have heard from Him are those which I have come into the world to speak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not perceive that He was speaking to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>So Jesus added, »When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am He. Of myself I do nothing; but as the Father has taught me, so I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And He who sent me is with me. He has not left me alone: for I do always what is pleasing to Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>As He thus spoke, many became believers in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus therefore said to those of the Jews who had now believed in Him, »As for you, if you hold fast to my teaching, then you are truly my disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>and you shall know the Truth, and the Truth will make you free.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>»We are descendants of Abraham,« they answered, »and have never at any time been in slavery to any one. What do those words of yours mean, `You shall become free'?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>»In most solemn truth I tell you,« replied Jesus, »that every one who commits sin is the slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>Now a slave does not remain permanently in his master's house, but a son does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>If then the Son shall make you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>You are descendants of Abraham, I know; but you want to kill me, because my teaching gains no ground within you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>The words I speak are those I have learnt in the presence of the Father. Therefore you also should do what you have heard from your father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>»Our father is Abraham,« they said. »If you were Abraham's children,« replied Jesus, »it is Abraham's deeds that you would be doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But, in fact, you are longing to kill me, a man who has spoken to you the truth which I have heard from God. Abraham did not do that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You are doing the deeds of your father. »We,« they replied, »are not illegitimate children. We have one Father, namely God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>»If God were your Father,« said Jesus, »you would love me; for it is from God that I came and I am now here. I have not come of myself, but He sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>How is it you do not understand me when I speak? It is because you cannot bear to listen to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>The father whose sons you are is the Devil; and you desire to do what gives him pleasure. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand firm in the truth–for there is no truth in him. Whenever he utters his lie, he utters it out of his own store; for he is a liar, and the father of lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which of you convicts me of sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He who is a child of God listens to God's words. You do not listen to them: and why? It is because you are not God's children.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>»Are we not right,« answered the Jews, »in saying that you are a Samaritan and are possessed by a demon?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>»I am not possessed by a demon,« replied Jesus. »On the contrary I honour my Father, and you dishonour me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>I, however, am not aiming at glory for myself: there is One who aims at glory for me–and who judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>In most solemn truth I tell you that if any one shall have obeyed my teaching he shall in no case ever see death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>»Now,« exclaimed the Jews, »we know that you are possessed by a demon. Abraham died, and so did the Prophets, and yet you say, `If any one shall have obeyed my teaching, he shall in no case ever taste death.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you really greater than our forefather Abraham? For he died. And the prophets died. Who do you make yourself out to be?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>»Were I to glorify myself,« answered Jesus, »I should have no real glory. There is One who glorifies me–namely my Father, who you say is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>You do not know Him, but I know Him perfectly; and were I to deny my knowledge of Him, I should resemble you, and be a liar. On the contrary I do know Him, and I obey His commands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Abraham your forefather exulted in the hope of seeing my day: and he saw it, and was glad.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>»You are not yet fifty years old,« cried the Jews, »and have you seen Abraham?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>»In most solemn truth,« answered Jesus, »I tell you that before Abraham came into existence, I am.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Thereupon they took up stones with which to stone Him, but He hid Himself and went away out of the Temple.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>As He passed by, He saw a man who had been blind from his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>So His disciples asked Him, »Rabbi, who sinned –this man or his parents– that he was born blind?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>»Neither he nor his parents sinned,« answered Jesus, »but he was born blind in order that God's mercy might be openly shown in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>We must do the works of Him who sent me while there is daylight. Night is coming on, when no one can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>When I am in the world, I am the Light of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>After thus speaking, He spat on the ground, and then, kneading the dust and spittle into clay, He smeared the clay over the man's eyes and said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>»Go and wash in the pool of Siloam« –the name means `Sent.' So he went and washed his eyes, and returned able to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>His neighbours, therefore, and the other people to whom he had been a familiar object because he was a beggar, began asking, »Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>»Yes it is,« replied some of them. »No it is not,« said others, »but he is like him.« His own statement was, »I am the man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>»How then were your eyes opened?« they asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>»He whose name is Jesus,« he answered, »made clay and smeared my eyes with it, and then told me to go to Siloam and wash. So I went and washed and obtained sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>»Where is he?« they inquired, but the man did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought him to the Pharisees–the man who had been blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>Now the day on which Jesus made the clay and opened the man's eyes was the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>So the Pharisees renewed their questioning as to how he had obtained his sight. »He put clay on my eyes,« he replied, »and I washed, and now I can see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>This led some of the Pharisees to say, »That man has not come from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.«»How is it possible for a bad man to do such miracles?« argued others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>And there was a division among them. So again they asked the once blind man, »What is your account of him? –for he opened your eyes.«»He is a Prophet,« he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>The Jews, however, did not believe the statement concerning him –that he had been blind and had obtained his sight– until they called his parents and asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>»Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How is it then that he can now see?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>»We know,« replied the parents, »that this is our son and that he was born blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>but how it is that he can now see or who has opened his eyes we do not know. Ask him himself; he is of full age; he himself will give his own account of it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>Such was their answer, because they were afraid of the Jews; for the Jews had already settled among themselves that if any one should acknowledge Jesus as the Christ, he should be excluded from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>That was why his parents said, »He is of full age: ask him himself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>A second time therefore they called the man who had been blind, and said, »Give God the praise: we know that that man is a sinner.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>»Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know,« he replied; »one thing I know–that I was once blind and that now I can see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>»What did he do to you?« they asked; »how did he open your eyes?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>»I have told you already,« he replied, »and you did not listen to me. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you also mean to be disciples of his?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>Then they railed at him, and said, »You are that man's disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God spoke to Moses; but as for this fellow we do not know where he comes from.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>»Why, this is marvellous!« the man replied; »you do not know where he comes from, and yet he has opened my eyes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>We know that God does not listen to bad people, but that if any one is a God-fearing man and obeys Him, to him He listens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>From the beginning of the world such a thing was never heard of as that any one should open the eyes of a man blind from his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>Had that man not come from God, he could have done nothing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>»You,« they replied, »were wholly begotten and born in sin, and do you teach us?« And they put him out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that they had done this. So having found him, He asked him, »Do you believe in the Son of God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>»Who is He, Sir?« replied the man. »Tell me, so that I may believe in Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>»You have seen Him,« said Jesus; »and not only so: He is now speaking to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>»I believe, Sir,« he said. And he threw himself at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>»I came into this world,« said Jesus, »to judge men, that those who do not see may see, and that those who do see may become blind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>These words were heard by those of the Pharisees who were present, and they asked Him, »Are we also blind?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>»If you were blind,« answered Jesus, »you would have no sin; but as a matter of fact you boast that you see. So your sin remains!«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.10'>
        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>»In most solemn truth I tell you that the man who does not enter the sheepfold by the door, but climbs over some other way, is a thief and a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.2'>But he who enters by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'>To him the porter opens the door, and the sheep hear his voice; and he calls his own sheep by their names and leads them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.4'>When he has brought out his own sheep –all of them– he walks at the head of them; and the sheep follow him, because they know his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.5'>But a stranger they will by no means follow, but will run away from him, because they do not know the voice of strangers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.6'>Jesus spoke to them in this figurative language, but they did not understand what He meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>Again therefore Jesus said to them, »In most solemn truth I tell you that I am the Door of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.8'>All who have come before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep would not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.9'>I am the Door. If any one enters by me, he will find safety, and will go in and out and find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.10'>The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy: I have come that they may have Life, and may have it in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.11'>»I am the Good Shepherd. A good shepherd lays down his very life for the sheep.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.12'>The hired servant –one who is not a shepherd and does not own the sheep– no sooner sees the wolf coming than he leaves the sheep and runs away; and the wolf worries and scatters them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>For he is only a hired servant and cares nothing for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.14'>»I am the Good Shepherd. And I know my sheep and my sheep know me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.15'>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I am laying down my life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.16'>I have also other sheep–which do not belong to this fold. Those also I must bring, and they will listen to my voice; and they shall become one flock under one Shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.17'>For this reason my Father loves me, because I am laying down my life in order to receive it back again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.18'>No one is taking it away from me, but I myself am laying it down. I am authorized to lay it down, and I am authorized to receive it back again. This is the command I received from my Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>Again there arose a division among the Jews because of these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>Many of them said, »He is possessed by a demon and is mad. Why do you listen to him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>Others argued, »That is not the language of a demoniac: and can a demon open blind men's eyes?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.22'>The Dedication Festival came on in Jerusalem. It was winter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>and Jesus was walking in the Temple in Solomon's Portico,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>when the Jews gathered round Him and kept asking Him, »How long do you mean to keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us so plainly.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>»I have told you,« answered Jesus, »and you do not believe. The deeds that I do in my Father's name–they give testimony about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>But you do not believe, because you are not my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep listen to my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>I give them the Life of the Ages, and they shall never, never perish, nor shall any one wrest them from my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>What my Father has given me is more precious than all besides; and no one is able to wrest anything from my Father's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>I and the Father are one.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Again the Jews brought stones with which to stone Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus remonstrated with them. »Many good deeds,« He said, »have I shown you as coming from the Father; for which of them are you going to stone me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>»For no good deed,« the Jews replied, »are we going to stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, who are only a man, are making yourself out to be God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>»Does it not stand written in your Law,« replied Jesus, »`I said, you are gods'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If those to whom God's word was addressed are called gods (and the Scripture cannot be annulled),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>how is it that you say to one whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, `You are blaspheming,' because I said, `I am God's Son'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If the deeds I do are not my Father's deeds, do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>But if they are, then even if you do not believe me, at least believe the deeds, that you may know and see clearly that the Father is in me, and that I am in the Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>This made them once more try to arrest Him, but He withdrew out of their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>Then He went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John had been baptizing at first; and there He stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>Large numbers of people also came to Him. Their report was, »John did not work any miracle, but all that John said about this Teacher was true.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.42'>And many became believers in Him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man, named Lazarus, of Bethany, was lying ill– Bethany being the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>(It was the Mary who poured the perfume over the Lord and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ill.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent to Him to say, »Master, he whom you hold dear is ill.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>Jesus received the message and said, »This illness is not to end in death, but is to promote the glory of God, in order that the Son of God may be glorified by it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When, however, He heard that Lazarus was ill, He still remained two days in that same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then, after that, He said to the disciples, »Let us return to Judaea.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>»Rabbi,« exclaimed the disciples, »the Jews have just been trying to stone you, and do you think of going back there again?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>»Are there not twelve hours in the day?« replied Jesus. »If any one walks in the daytime, he does not stumble–because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if a man walks by night, he does stumble, because the light is not in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>He said this, and afterwards He added, »Our friend Lazarus is sleeping, but I will go and wake him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>»Master,« said the disciples, »if he is asleep he will recover.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought He referred to the rest taken in ordinary sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>So then He told them plainly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>»Lazarus is dead; and for your sakes I am glad I was not there, in order that you may believe. But let us go to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>»Let us go also,« Thomas, the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, »that we may die with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>On His arrival Jesus found that Lazarus had already been three days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Bethany was near Jerusalem, the distance being a little less than two miles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and a considerable number of the Jews were with Martha and Mary, having come to express sympathy with them on the death of their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha, however, as soon as she heard the tidings, »Jesus is coming,« went to meet Him; but Mary remained sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>So Martha came and spoke to Jesus. »Master, if you had been here,« she said, »my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>And even now I know that whatever you ask God for, God will give you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>»Your brother shall rise again,« replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>»I know,« said Martha, »that he will rise again at the resurrection, on the last day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>»I am the Resurrection and the Life,« said Jesus; »he who believes in me, even if he has died, he shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and every one who is living and is a believer in me shall never, never die. Do you believe this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>»Yes, Master,« she replied; »I thoroughly believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who was to come into the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>After saying this, she went and called her sister Mary privately, telling her, »The Rabbi is here and is asking for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>So she, on hearing that, rose up quickly to go to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still at the place where Martha had met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>So the Jews who were with Mary in the house sympathizing with her, when they saw that she had risen hastily and had gone out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep aloud there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary then, when she came to Jesus and saw Him, fell at His feet and exclaimed, »Master, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Seeing her weeping aloud, and the Jews in like manner weeping who had come with her, Jesus, curbing the strong emotion of His spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>though deeply troubled, asked them, »Where have you laid him?«»Master, come and see,« was their reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>»See how dear he held him,« said the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But others of them asked, »Was this man who opened the blind man's eyes unable to prevent this man from dying?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus, however, again restraining His strong feeling, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone had been laid against the mouth of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>»Take away the stone,« said Jesus. Martha, the sister of the dead man, exclaimed, »Master, by this time there is a foul smell; for it is three days since he died.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>»Did I not promise you,« replied Jesus, »that if you believe, you shall see the glory of God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they removed the stone. Then Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, »Father, I thank Thee that Thou hast heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>I know that Thou always hearest me; but for the sake of the crowd standing round I have said this–that they may believe that Thou didst send me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>After speaking thus, He called out in a loud voice, »Lazarus, come out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>The dead man came out, his hands and feet wrapped in cloths, and his face wrapped round with a towel. »Untie him,« said Jesus, »and let him go free.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Thereupon a considerable number of the Jews– namely those who had come to Mary and had witnessed His deeds– became believers in Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>though some of them went off to the Pharisees and told them what He had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Therefore the High Priests and the Pharisees held a meeting of the Sanhedrin. »What steps are we taking?« they asked one another; »for this man is performing a great number of miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we leave him alone in this way, everybody will believe in him, and the Romans will come and blot out both our city and our nation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But one of them, named Caiaphas, being High Priest that year, said, »You know nothing about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>You do not reflect that it is to your interest that one man should die for the people rather than the whole nation perish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>It was not as a mere man that he thus spoke. But being High Priest that year he was inspired to declare that Jesus was to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but in order to unite into one body all the far-scattered children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day forward they planned and schemed in order to put Him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Therefore Jesus no longer went about openly among the Jews, but He left that neighbourhood and went into the district near the Desert, to a town called Ephraim, and remained there with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>The Jewish Passover was coming near, and many from that district went up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They therefore looked out for Jesus, and asked one another as they stood in the Temple, »What do you think? –will he come to the Festival at all?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the High Priests and the Pharisees had issued orders that if any one knew where He was, he should give information, so that they might arrest Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus, however, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was whom He had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>So they gave a dinner there in honour of Jesus, at which Martha waited at table, but Lazarus was one of the guests who were with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Availing herself of the opportunity, Mary took a pound weight of pure spikenard, very costly, and poured it over His feet, and wiped His feet with her hair, so that the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then said Judas (the Iscariot, one of the Twelve–the one who afterwards betrayed Jesus),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>»Why was not that perfume sold for 300 shillings and the money given to the poor?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>The reason he said this was not that he cared for the poor, but that he was a thief, and that being in charge of the money-box, he used to steal what was put into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>But Jesus interposed. »Do not blame her,« He said, »allow her to have kept it for the time of my preparation for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor you always have with you, but you have not me always.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now it became widely known among the Jews that Jesus was there; but they came not only on His account, but also in order to see Lazarus whom He had brought back to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>The High Priests, however, consulted together to put Lazarus also to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>for because of him many of the Jews left them and became believers in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day a great crowd of those who had come to the Festival, hearing that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, shouting as they went, »God save him! Blessings on him who comes in the name of the Lord–even on the King of Israel!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, having procured a young ass, sat upon it, just as the Scripture says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>»Fear not, Daughter of Zion! See, thy King is coming riding on an ass's colt.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>The meaning of this His disciples did not understand at the time; but after Jesus was glorified they recollected that this was written about Him, and that they had done this to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The large number of people, however, who had been present when He called Lazarus out of the tomb and brought him back to life, related what they had witnessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>This was also why the crowd came to meet Him, because they had heard of His having performed that miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The result was that the Pharisees said among themselves, »Observe how idle all your efforts are! The world is gone after him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now some of those who used to come up to worship at the Festival were Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>They came to Philip, of Bethsaida in Galilee, with the request, »Sir, we wish to see Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came and told Andrew: Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>His answer was, »The time has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>In most solemn truth I tell you that unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains what it was–a single grain; but that if it dies, it yields a rich harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who holds his life dear, is destroying it; and he who makes his life of no account in this world shall keep it to the Life of the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If a man wishes to be my servant, let him follow me; and where I am, there too shall my servant be. If a man wishes to be my servant, the Father will honour him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul full of trouble; and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour. But for this purpose I have come to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify Thy name.« Thereupon there came a voice from the sky, »I have glorified it and will also glorify it again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The crowd that stood by and heard it, said that there had been thunder. Others said, »An angel spoke to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>»It is not for my sake,« said Jesus, »that that voice came, but for your sakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is a judgement of this world: now will the Prince of this world be driven out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I – if I am lifted up from the earth– will draw all men to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>He said this to indicate the kind of death He would die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The crowd answered Him, »We have heard out of the Law that the Christ remains for ever. In what sense do you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is that Son of Man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>»Yet a little while,« He replied, »the light is among you. Be faithful to the light that you have, for fear darkness should overtake you; for a man who walks in the dark does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>In the degree that you have light, believe in the Light, so that you may become sons of Light.« Jesus said this, and went away and hid Himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But though He had performed such great miracles in their presence, they did not believe in Him–</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>in order that the words of Isaiah the Prophet might be fulfilled, »Lord, who has believed our preaching? And the arm of the Lord–to whom has it been unveiled?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this reason they were unable to believe–because Isaiah said again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>»He has blinded their eyes and made their minds callous, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their minds, and should turn, and I should heal them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah uttered these words because he saw His glory; and he spoke of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless even from among the Rulers many believed in Him. But because of the Pharisees they did not avow their belief, for fear they should be shut out from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>For they loved the glory that comes from men rather than the glory that comes from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jesus cried aloud, »He who believes in me, believes not so much in me, as in Him who sent me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>and he who sees me sees Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come like light into the world, in order that no one who believes in me may remain in the dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any one hears my teachings and regards them not, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who sets me at naught and does not receive my teachings is not left without a judge: the Message which I have spoken will judge him on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>Because I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me, Himself gave me a command what to say and in what words to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that His command is the Life of the Ages. What therefore I speak, I speak just as the Father has bidden me.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now just before the Feast of the Passover this incident took place. Jesus knew that the time had come for Him to leave this world and go to the Father; and having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>While supper was proceeding, the Devil having by this time suggested to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, the thought of betraying Him, Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>although He knew that the Father had put everything into His hands, and that He had come forth from God and was now going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>rose from the table, threw off His upper garments, and took a towel and tied it round Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then He poured water into a basin, and proceeded to wash the feet of the disciples and to wipe them with the towel which He had put round Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>When He came to Simon Peter, Peter objected. »Master,« he said, »are you going to wash my feet?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>»What I am doing,« answered Jesus, »for the present you do not know, but afterwards you shall know.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>»Never, while the world lasts,« said Peter, »shall you wash my feet.«»If I do not wash you,« replied Jesus, »you have no share with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>»Master,« said Peter, »wash not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>»Any one who has lately bathed,« said Jesus, »does not need to wash more than his feet, but is clean all over. And you my disciples are clean, and yet this is not true of all of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For He knew who was betraying Him, and that was why He said, »You are not all of you clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So after He had washed their feet, put on His garments again, and returned to the table, He said to them, »Do you understand what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>You call me `The Rabbi' and `The Master,' and rightly so, for such I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.14'>If I then, your Master and Rabbi, have washed your feet, it is also your duty to wash one another's feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.15'>For I have set you an example in order that you may do what I have done to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.16'>In most solemn truth I tell you that a servant is not superior to his master, nor is a messenger superior to him who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.17'>If you know all this, blessed are you if you act accordingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I am not speaking of all of you. I know whom I have chosen, but things are as they are in order that the Scripture may be fulfilled, which says, `He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.19'>From this time forward I tell you things before they happen, in order that when they do happen you may believe that I am He.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.20'>In most solemn truth I tell you that he who receives whoever I send receives me, and that he who receives me receives Him who sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>After speaking thus Jesus was troubled in spirit and said with deep earnestness, »In most solemn truth I tell you that one of you will betray me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>The disciples began looking at one another, at a loss to know to which of them He was referring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>There was at table one of His disciples –the one Jesus loved– reclining with his head on Jesus's bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Making a sign therefore to him, Simon Peter said, »Tell us to whom he is referring.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>So he, having his head on Jesus's bosom, leaned back and asked, »Master, who is it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>»It is the one,« answered Jesus, »for whom I shall dip this piece of bread and to whom I shall give it.« Accordingly He dipped the piece of bread, and took it and gave it to Judas, the son of the Iscariot Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>Then, after Judas had received the piece of bread, Satan entered into him. »Lose no time about it,« said Jesus to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>But why He said this no one else at the table understood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>Some, however, supposed that because Judas had the money-box Jesus meant, »Buy what we require for the Festival,« or that he should give something to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.30'>So Judas took the piece of bread and immediately went out. And it was night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.31'>So when he was gone out, Jesus said, »Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.32'>Moreover God will glorify Him in Himself, and will glorify Him without delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.33'>Dear children, I am still with you a little longer. You will seek me, but, as I said to the Jews, `Where I am going you cannot come,' so for the present I say to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.34'>A new commandment I give you, to love one another; that as I have loved you, you also may love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.35'>It is by this that every one will know that you are my disciples–if you love one another.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.36'>»Master,« inquired Simon Peter, »where are you going?«»Where I am going,« replied Jesus, »you cannot be my follower now, but you shall be later.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.37'>»Master,« asked Peter again, »why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life on your behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.38'>»You say you will lay down your life on my behalf!« said Jesus; »in most solemn truth I tell you that the cock will not crow before you have three times disowned me.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>Now Judas also, who at that very time was betraying Him, knew the place, for Jesus had often resorted there with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>So Judas, followed by the battalion and by a detachment of the Temple police sent by the High Priests and Pharisees, came there with torches and lamps and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Jesus therefore, knowing all that was about to befall Him, went out to meet them. »Who are you looking for?« He asked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>»For Jesus the Nazarene,« was the answer. »I am he,« He replied. (Now Judas who was betraying Him was also standing with them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>As soon then as He said to them, »I am he,« they went backwards and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Again therefore He asked them, »Who are you looking for?«»For Jesus the Nazarene,« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>»I have told you,« replied Jesus, »that I am he. If therefore you are looking for me, let these my disciples go their way.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>He made this request in order that the words He had spoken might be fulfilled, »As for those whom Thou hast given me, I have not lost one.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>So the battalion and their tribune and the Jewish police closed in, and took Jesus and bound Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>They then brought Him to Annas first; for Annas was the father-in-law of Caiaphas who was High Priest that year.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>Meanwhile Simon Peter was following Jesus, and so also was another disciple. The latter was known to the High Priest, and went in with Jesus into the court of the High Priest's palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter remained standing outside the door, till the disciple who was acquainted with the High Priest came out and induced the portress to let Peter in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>This led the girl, the portress, to ask Peter, »Are you also one of this man's disciples?«»No, I am not,« he replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>Now because it was cold the servants and the police had lighted a charcoal fire, and were standing and warming themselves; and Peter too remained with them, standing and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>So the High Priest questioned Jesus about His disciples and His teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>»As for me,« replied Jesus, »I have spoken openly to the world. I have continually taught in some synagogue or in the Temple where all the Jews are wont to assemble, and I have said nothing in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why do you question me? Question those who heard what it was I said to them: these witnesses here know what I said.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>Upon His saying this, one of the officers standing by struck Him with his open hand, asking Him as he did so, »Is that the way you answer the High Priest?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>»If I have spoken wrongly,« replied Jesus, »bear witness to it as wrong; but if rightly, why that blow?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>So Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the High Priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>But Simon Peter remained standing and warming himself, and this led to their asking him, »Are you also one of his disciples?« He denied it, and said, »No, I am not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the High Priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, »Did I not see you in the garden with him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Once more Peter denied it, and immediately a cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>So they brought Jesus from Caiaphas's house to the Praetorium. It was the early morning, and they would not enter the Praetorium themselves for fear of defilement, and in order that they might be able to eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Accordingly Pilate came out to them and inquired, »What accusation have you to bring against this man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>»If the man were not a criminal,« they replied, »we would not have handed him over to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>»Take him yourselves,« said Pilate, »and judge him by your Law.«»We have no power,« replied the Jews, »to put any man to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>They said this that the words might be fulfilled in which Jesus predicted the kind of death He was to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Re-entering the Praetorium, therefore, Pilate called Jesus and asked Him, »Are you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>»Do you say this of yourself, or have others told it you about me?« replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>»Am I a Jew?« exclaimed Pilate; »it is your own nation and the High Priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>»My kingdom,« replied Jesus, »does not belong to this world. If my kingdom did belong to this world, my subjects would have resolutely fought to save me from being delivered up to the Jews. But, as a matter of fact, my kingdom has not this origin.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>»So then you are a king!« rejoined Pilate. »Yes,« said Jesus, »you say truly that I am a king. For this purpose I was born, and for this purpose I have come into the world–to give testimony for the truth. Every one who is a friend of the truth listens to my voice.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>»What is truth?« said Pilate. But no sooner had he spoken the words than he went out again to the Jews and told them, »I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you have a custom that I should release one prisoner to you at the Passover. So shall I release to you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>With a roar of voices they again cried out, saying, »Not this man, but Barabbas!« Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate took Jesus and scourged Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers, twisting twigs of thorn into a wreath, put it on His head, and threw round Him a crimson cloak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>Then they began to march up to Him, saying in a mocking voice, »Hail King of the Jews!« And they struck Him with the palms of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Once more Pilate came out and said to the Jews, »See, I am bringing him out to you to let you clearly understand that I find no crime in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>So Jesus came out, wearing the wreath of thorns and the crimson cloak. And Pilate said to them, »See, there is the man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>As soon then as the High Priests and the officers saw Him, they shouted »To the cross! To the cross!« »Take him yourselves and crucify him,« said Pilate; »for I, at any rate, find no crime in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>»We,« replied the Jews, »have a Law, and in accordance with that Law he ought to die, for having claimed to be the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>More alarmed than ever, Pilate no sooner heard these words than he re-entered the Praetorium and began to question Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>»What is your origin?« he asked. But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>»Do you refuse to speak even to me?« asked Pilate; »do you not know that I have it in my power either to release you or to crucify you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>»You would have had no power whatever over me,« replied Jesus, »had it not been granted you from above. On that account he who has delivered me up to you is more guilty than you are.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>Upon receiving this answer, Pilate was for releasing Him. But the Jews kept shouting, »If you release this man, you are no friend of Caesar's. Every one who sets himself up as king declares himself a rebel against Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>On hearing this, Pilate brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judge's seat in a place called the Pavement–or in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>It was the day of Preparation for the Passover, about six o'clock in the morning. Then he said to the Jews, »There is your king!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>This caused a storm of outcries, »Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!«»Am I to crucify your king?« Pilate asked. »We have no king, except Caesar,« answered the High Priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then Pilate gave Him up to them to be crucified. Accordingly they took Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>and He went out carrying His own cross, to the place called Skull-place –or, in Hebrew, Golgotha–</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they nailed Him to a cross, and two others at the same time, one on each side and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a notice and had it fastened to the top of the cross. It ran thus: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews read this notice, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the notice was in three languages–Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>This led the Jewish High Priests to remonstrate with Pilate. »You should not write `The King of the Jews,'« they said, »but that he claimed to be King of the Jews.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>»What I have written I have written,« was Pilate's answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>So the soldiers, as soon as they had crucified Jesus, took His garments, including His tunic, and divided them into four parts–one part for each soldier. The tunic was without seam, woven from the top in one piece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>So they said to one another, »Do not let us tear it. Let us draw lots for it.« This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, »They shared my garments among them, and drew lots for my clothing.« That was just what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now standing close to the cross of Jesus were His mother and His mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary of Magdala.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>So Jesus, seeing His mother, and seeing the disciple whom He loved standing near, said to His mother, »Behold, your son!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then He said to the disciple, »Behold, your mother!« And from that time the disciple received her into his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, knowing that everything was now brought to an end, said–that the Scripture might be fulfilled, »I am thirsty.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>There was a jar of wine standing there. With this wine they filled a sponge, put it on the end of a stalk of hyssop, and lifted it to His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>As soon as Jesus had taken the wine, He said, »It is finished.« And then, bowing His head, He yielded up His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Meanwhile the Jews, because it was the day of Preparation for the Passover, and in order that the bodies might not remain on the crosses during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was one of special solemnity), requested Pilate to have the legs of the dying men broken, and the bodies removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Accordingly the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and also of the other who had been crucified with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>Then they came to Jesus Himself: but when they saw that He was already dead, they refrained from breaking His legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>One of the soldiers, however, made a thrust at His side with a lance, and immediately blood and water flowed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>This statement is the testimony of an eye-witness, and it is true. He knows that he is telling the truth–in order that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For all this took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled which declares, »Not one of His bones shall be broken.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another Scripture says, »They shall look on Him whom they have pierced.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After this, Joseph of Arimathaea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but for fear of the Jews a secret disciple, asked Pilate's permission to carry away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and removed the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus too –he who at first had visited Jesus by night– came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, in weight about seventy or eighty pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>Taking down the body they wrapped it in linen cloths along with the spices, in accordance with the Jewish mode of preparing for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>There was a garden at the place where Jesus had been crucified, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one had yet been buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation for the Jewish Passover, and the tomb was close at hand, they put Jesus there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>On the first day of the week, very early, while it was still dark, Mary of Magdala came to the tomb and saw that the stone had been removed from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she ran, as fast as she could, to find Simon Peter and the other disciple –the one who was dear to Jesus– and to tell them, »They have taken the Master out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have put Him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter and the other disciple started at once to go to the tomb, both of them running,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and reached it before he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>Stooping and looking in, he saw the linen cloths lying there on the ground, but he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Simon Peter, however, also came, following him, and entered the tomb. There on the ground he saw the cloths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the towel, which had been placed over the face of Jesus, not lying with the cloths, but folded up and put by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who had been the first to come to the tomb, also went in and saw and was convinced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For until now they had not understood the inspired teaching, that He must rise again from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then they went away and returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>Meanwhile Mary remained standing near the tomb, weeping aloud. She did not enter the tomb, but as she wept she stooped and looked in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and saw two angels clothed in white raiment, sitting one at the head and one at the feet where the body of Jesus had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They spoke to her. »Why are you weeping?« they asked. »Because,« she replied, »they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have put him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>While she was speaking, she turned round and saw Jesus standing there, but did not recognize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>»Why are you weeping?« He asked; »who are you looking for?« She, supposing that He was the gardener, replied, »Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him and I will remove him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>»Mary!« said Jesus. She turned to Him. »Rabboni!« she cried in Hebrew: the word means `Teacher!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>»Do not cling to me,« said Jesus, »for I have not yet ascended to the Father. But take this message to my brethren: `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary of Magdala came and brought word to the disciples. »I have seen the Master,« she said. And she told them that He had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>On that same first day of the week, when it was evening and, for fear of the Jews, the doors of the house where the disciples were, were locked, Jesus came and stood in their midst, and said to them, »Peace be to you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>Having said this He showed them His hands and also His side; and the disciples were filled with joy at seeing the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>A second time, therefore, He said to them, »Peace be to you! As the Father sent me, I also now send you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>Having said this He breathed upon them and said, »Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you remit the sins of any persons, they remain remitted to them. If you bind fast the sins of any, they remain bound.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Thomas, one of the twelve –surnamed `the Twin'– was not among them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>So the rest of the disciples told him, »We have seen the Master!« His reply was, »Unless I see in his hands the wound made by the nails and put my finger into the wound, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>A week later the disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them, when Jesus came –though the doors were locked– and stood in their midst, and said, »Peace be to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then He said to Thomas, »Bring your finger here and feel my hands; bring you hand and put it into my side; and do not be ready to disbelieve but to believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>»My Lord and my God!« replied Thomas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>»Because you have seen me,« replied Jesus, »you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>There were also a great number of other signs which Jesus performed in the presence of the disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these have been recorded in order that you may believe that He is the Christ, the Son of God, and that, through believing, you may have Life through His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After this, Jesus again showed Himself to the disciples. It was at the Lake of Tiberias. The circumstances were as follows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter was with Thomas, called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zabdi, and two others of the Master's disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, »I am going fishing.«»We will go too,« said they. So they set out and went on board their boat; but they caught nothing that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>When, however, day was now dawning, Jesus stood on the beach, though the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>He called to them. »Children,« He said, »have you any food there?«»No,« they answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>»Throw the net in on the right hand side,« He said, »and you will find fish.« So they threw the net in, and now they could scarcely drag it along for the quantity of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>This made the disciple whom Jesus loved say to Peter, »It is the Master.« Simon Peter therefore, when he heard the words, »It is the Master,« drew on his fisherman's shirt –for he had not been wearing it– put on his girdle, and sprang into the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the rest of the disciples came in the small boat (for they were not far from land–only about a hundred yards off), dragging the net full of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>As soon as they landed, they saw a charcoal fire burning there, with fish broiling on it, and bread close by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus told them to fetch some of the fish which they had just caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>So Simon Peter went on board the boat and drew the net ashore full of large fish, 153 in number; and yet, although there were so many, the net had not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>»Come this way and have breakfast,« said Jesus. But not one of the disciples ventured to question Him as to who He was, for they felt sure that it was the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Then Jesus came and took the bread and gave them some, and the fish in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was now the third occasion on which Jesus showed Himself to the disciples after He had risen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, »Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these others do?«»Yes, Master,« was his answer; »you know that you are dear to me.« »Then feed my lambs,« replied Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>Again a second time He asked him, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?«»Yes, Master,« he said, »you know that you are dear to me.«»Then be a shepherd to my sheep,« He said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>A third time Jesus put the question:»Simon, son of John, am I dear to you?« It grieved Peter that Jesus asked him the third time, »Am I dear to you?«»Master,« he replied, »you know everything, you can see that you are dear to me.«»Then feed my much-loved sheep,« said Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>»In most solemn truth I tell you that whereas, when you were young, you used to put on your girdle and walk whichever way you chose, when you have grown old you will stretch out your arms and some one else will put a girdle round you and carry you where you have no wish to go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This He said to indicate the kind of death by which that disciple would bring glory to God; and after speaking thus He said to him, »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned round and noticed the disciple whom Jesus loved following–the one who at the supper had leaned back on His breast and had asked, »Master, who is it that is betraying you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>On seeing him, Peter asked Jesus, »And, Master, what about him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>»If I desire him to remain till I come,« replied Jesus, »what concern is that of yours? You, yourself, must follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Hence the report spread among the brethren that that disciple would never die. Yet Jesus did not say, »He is not to die,« but, »If I desire him to remain till I come, what concern is that of yours?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>That is the disciple who gives his testimony as to these matters, and has written this history; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>But there are also many other things which Jesus did–so vast a number indeed that if they were all described in detail, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would have to be written.</verse>
