      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The revelation given by Jesus Christ, which God granted Him, that He might make known to His servants certain events which must shortly come to pass: and He sent His angel and communicated it to His servant John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>This is the John who taught the truth concerning the Word of God and the truth told us by Jesus Christ– a faithful account of what he had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who reads and blessed are those who listen to the words of this prophecy and lay to heart what is written in it; for the time for its fulfillment is now close at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John sends greetings to the seven Churches in the province of Asia. May grace be granted to you, and peace, from Him who is and was and evermore will be; and from the seven Spirits which are before His throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the truthful witness, the first of the dead to be born to Life, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and has freed us from our sins with His own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and has formed us into a Kingdom, to be priests to God, His Father–to Him be ascribed the glory and the power until the Ages of the Ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>He is coming in the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and so will those who pierced Him; and all the nations of the earth will gaze on Him and mourn. Even so. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>»I am the Alpha and the Omega,« says the Lord God, »He who is and was and evermore will be–the Ruler of all.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, your brother, and a sharer with you in the sorrows and Kingship and patient endurance of Jesus, found myself in the island of Patmos, on account of the Word of God and the truth told us by Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>In the Spirit I found myself present on the day of the Lord, and I heard behind me a loud voice which resembled the blast of a trumpet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>It said, »Write forthwith in a roll an account of what you see, and send it to the seven Churches–to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyateira, Sardis, Philadelphia and Laodicea.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>I turned to see who it was that was speaking to me; and then I saw seven golden lampstands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the center of the lampstands some One resembling the Son of Man, clothed in a robe which reached to His feet, and with a girdle of gold across His breast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and His hair were white, like white wool–as white as snow; and His eyes resembled a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>His feet were like silver-bronze, when it is white-hot in a furnace; and His voice resembled the sound of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>In His right hand He held seven stars, and a sharp, two-edged sword was seen coming from His mouth; and His glance resembled the sun when it is shining with its full strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>When I saw Him, I fell at His feet as if I were dead. But He laid His right hand upon me and said, »Do not be afraid: I am the First and the Last, and the ever-living One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I died; but I am now alive until the Ages of the Ages, and I have the keys of the gates of Death and of Hades!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write down therefore the things you have just seen, and those which are now taking place, and those which are soon to follow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>the secret meaning of the seven stars which you have seen in My right hand, and of the seven lampstands of gold. The seven stars are the ministers of the seven Churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven Churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>»To the minister of the Church in Ephesus write as follows:« `This is what He who holds the seven stars in the grasp of His right hand says–He who walks to and fro among the seven lampstands of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know your doings and your toil and patient suffering. And I know that you cannot tolerate wicked men, but have put to the test those who say that they themselves are Apostles but are not, and you have found them to be liars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And you endure patiently and have borne burdens for My sake and have never grown weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>Yet I have this against you–that you no longer love Me as you did at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Be mindful, therefore, of the height from which you have fallen. Repent at once, and act as you did at first, or else I will surely come and remove your lampstand out of its place–unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>Yet this you have in your favor: you hate the doings of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>»`Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. To him who overcomes I will give the privilege of eating the fruit of the Tree of Life, which is in the Paradise of God.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>»To the minister of the Church at Smyrna write as follows:« `This is what the First and the Last says–He who died and has returned to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>Your sufferings I know, and your poverty –but you are rich– and the evil name given you by those who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but are Satan's synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Dismiss your fears concerning all that you are about to suffer. I tell you that the Devil is about to throw some of you into prison that you may be put to the test, and for ten days you will have to endure persecution. Be faithful to the End, even if you have to die, and then I will give you the victor's Wreath of Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>»`Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. He who overcomes shall be in no way hurt by the Second Death.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>»To the minister of the Church at Pergamum write as follows:« `This is what He who has the sharp, two-edged sword says. I know where you dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>Satan's throne is there; and yet you are true to Me, and did not deny your faith in Me, even in the days of Antipas My witness and faithful friend, who was put to death among you, in the place where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>Yet I have a few things against you, because you have with you some that cling to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling-block in the way of the descendants of Israel–to eat what had been sacrificed to idols, and commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So even you have some that cling in the same way to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent, at once; or else I will come to you quickly, and will make war upon them with the sword which is in My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>»`Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches. He who overcomes –to him I will give some of the hidden Manna, and a white stone; and– written upon the stone and known only to him who receives it– a new name.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>»To the minister of the Church at Thyateira write as follows:« `This is what the Son of God says–He who has eyes like a flame of fire, and feet resembling silver-bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your doings, your love, your faith, your service, and your patient endurance; and that of late you have toiled harder than you did at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>Yet I have this against you, that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and by her teaching leads astray My servants, so that they commit fornication and eat what has been sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>I have given her time to repent, but she is determined not to repent of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>I tell you that I am about to cast her upon a bed of sickness, and I will severely afflict those who commit adultery with her, unless they repent of conduct such as hers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>Her children too shall surely die; and all the Churches shall come to know that I am He who searches into men's inmost thoughts; and to each of you I will give a requital which shall be in accordance with what your conduct has been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you, the rest of you in Thyateira, all who do not hold this teaching and are not the people who have learnt the »deep things,« as they call them (the deep things of Satan!) –to you I say that I lay no other burden on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>Only that which you already possess, cling to until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>»`And to him who overcomes and obeys My commands to the very end, I will give authority over the nations of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>And he shall be their shepherd, ruling them with a rod of iron, just as earthenware jars are broken to pieces; and his power over them shall be like that which I Myself have received from My Father;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>and I will give him the Morning Star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>»To the minister of the Church at Sardis write as follows:« `This is what He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars says. I know your doings–you are supposed to be alive, but in reality you are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Rouse yourself and keep awake, and strengthen those things which remain but have well-nigh perished; for I have found no doings of yours free from imperfection in the sight of My God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Be mindful, therefore, of the lessons you have received and heard. Continually lay them to heart, and repent. If, however, you fail to rouse yourself and keep awake, I shall come upon you suddenly like a thief, and you will certainly not know the hour at which I shall come to judge you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>Yet you have in Sardis a few who have not soiled their garments; and they shall walk with Me in white; for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>»`In this way he who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments; and I will certainly not blot out his name from the Book of Life, but will acknowledge him in the presence of My Father and His angels.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>»To the minister of the Church at Philadelphia write as follows:« `This is what the holy One and the true says –He who has the key of David– He who opens and no one shall shut, and shuts and no one shall open.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know your doings. I have put an opened door in front of you, which no one can shut; because you have but a little power, and yet you have guarded My word and have not disowned Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>I will cause some belonging to Satan's synagogue who say that they themselves are Jews, and are not, but are liars–I will make them come and fall at your feet and know for certain that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because in spite of suffering you have guarded My word, I in turn will guard you from that hour of trial which is soon coming upon the whole world, to put to the test the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I am coming quickly: cling to that which you already possess, so that your wreath of victory be not taken away from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>»`He who overcomes–I will make him a pillar in the sanctuary of My God, and he shall never go out from it again. And I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which is to come down out of Heaven from My God, and My own new name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>»And to the minister of the Church at Laodicea write as follows:« `This is what the Amen says–the true and faithful witness, the Beginning and Lord of God's Creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know your doings–you are neither cold nor hot; I would that you were cold or hot!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>Accordingly, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, before long I will vomit you out of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>You say, I am rich, and have wealth stored up, and I stand in need of nothing; and you do not know that if there is a wretched creature it is you – pitiable, poor, blind, naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>Therefore I counsel you to buy of Me gold refined in the fire that you may become rich, and white robes to put on, so as to hide your shameful nakedness, and eye-salve to anoint your eyes with, so that you may be able to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>All whom I hold dear, I reprove and chastise; therefore be in earnest and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>I am now standing at the door and am knocking. If any one listens to My voice and opens the door, I will go in to be with him and will feast with him, and he shall feast with Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>»`To him who overcomes I will give the privilege of sitting down with Me on My throne, as I also have overcome and have sat down with My Father on His throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>Let all who have ears give heed to what the Spirit is saying to the Churches.'«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After all this I looked and saw a door in Heaven standing open, and the voice that I had previously heard, which resembled the blast of a trumpet, again spoke to me and said, »Come up here, and I will show you things which are to happen in the future.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I found myself in the Spirit, and saw a throne in Heaven, and some One sitting on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>The appearance of Him who sat there was like jasper or sard; and encircling the throne was a rainbow, in appearance like an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Surrounding the throne there were also twenty-four other thrones, on which sat twenty-four Elders clothed in white robes, with victors' wreaths of gold upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>Out from the throne there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals of thunder, while in front of the throne seven blazing lamps were burning, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And in front of the throne there seemed to be a sea of glass, resembling crystal. And midway between the throne and the Elders, and surrounding the throne, were four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first living creature resembled a lion, the second an ox, the third had a face like that of a man, and the fourth resembled an eagle flying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And each of the four living creatures had six wings, and in every direction, and within, are full of eyes; and day after day, and night after night, they never cease saying, »Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Ruler of all, who wast and art and evermore shalt be.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who is seated on the throne, and lives until the Ages of the Ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four Elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship Him who lives until the Ages of the Ages, and they cast their wreaths down in front of the throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>saying, »It is fitting, O our Lord and God, That we should ascribe unto Thee the glory and the honor and the power; For Thou didst create all things, And because it was Thy will they came into existence, and were created.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw lying in the right hand of Him who sat on the throne a book written on both sides and closely sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a mighty angel who was exclaiming in a loud voice, »Who is worthy to open the book and break its seals?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>But no one in Heaven, or on earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book or look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And while I was weeping bitterly, because no one was found worthy to open the book or look into it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>one of the Elders said to me, »Do not weep. The Lion which belongs to the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has triumphed, and will open the book and break its seven seals.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>Then, midway between the throne and the four living creatures, I saw a Lamb standing among the Elders. He looked as if He had been offered in sacrifice, and He had seven horns and seven eyes. The last-named are the seven Spirits of God, and have been sent far and wide into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>So He comes, and now He has taken the book out of the right hand of Him who is seated on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when He had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four Elders fell down before the Lamb, having each of them a harp and bringing golden bowls full of incense, which represent the prayers of God's people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And now they sing a new song. »It is fitting,« they say, »that Thou shouldst be the One to take the book And break its seals; Because Thou hast been offered in sacrifice, And hast purchased for God with Thine own blood Some out of every tribe and language and people and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And hast formed them into a Kingdom to be priests to our God, And they reign over the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I looked, and heard what seemed to be the voices of countless angels on every side of the throne, and of the living creatures and the Elders. Their number was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>and in loud voices they were singing, »It is fitting that the Lamb which has been offered in sacrifice should receive all power and riches and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And as for every created thing in Heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea, and everything that was in any of these, I heard them say, »To Him who is seated on the throne, And to the Lamb, Be ascribed all blessing and honor And glory and might, Until the Ages of the Ages!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>Then the four living creatures said »Amen,« and the Elders fell down and worshipped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And when the Lamb broke one of the seven seals I saw it, and I heard one of the four living creatures say, as if in a voice of thunder, »Come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I looked and a white horse appeared, and its rider carried a bow; and a victor's wreath was given to him; and he went out conquering and in order to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, »Come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse came out–a fiery-red one; and power was given to its rider to take peace from the earth, and to cause men to kill one another; and a great sword was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, »Come.« I looked, and a black horse appeared, its rider carrying a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard what seemed to be a voice speaking in the midst of the four living creatures, and saying, »A quart of wheat for a shilling, and three quarts of barley for a shilling; but do not injure either the oil or the wine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>When the Lamb broke the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, »Come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>I looked and a pale-colored horse appeared. Its rider's name was Death, and Hades came close behind him; and authority was given to them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with the sword or with famine or pestilence or by means of the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw at the foot of the altar the souls of those whose lives had been sacrificed because of the word of God and of the testimony which they had given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And now in loud voices they cried out, saying, »How long, O Sovereign Lord, the holy One and the true, dost Thou delay judgment and the taking of vengeance upon the inhabitants of the earth for our blood?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there was given to each of them a long white robe, and they were bidden to wait patiently for a short time longer, until the full number of their fellow bondservants should also complete–namely of their brethren who were soon to be killed just as they had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>When the Lamb broke the sixth seal I looked, and there was a great earthquake, and the sun became as dark as sackcloth, and the whole disc of the moon became like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>The stars in the sky also fell to the earth, as when a fig-tree, upon being shaken by a gale of wind, casts its unripe figs to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>The sky too passed away, as if a scroll were being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>The kings of the earth and the great men, the military chiefs, the wealthy and the powerful –all, whether slaves or free men– hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>while they called to the mountains and the rocks, saying, »Fall on us and hide us from the presence of Him who sits on the throne and from the anger of the Lamb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>for the day of His anger –that great day– has come, and who is able to stand?«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, and holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind should blow over the earth or the sea or upon any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel coming from the east and carrying a seal belonging to the ever-living God. He called in a loud voice to the four angels whose work it was to injure the earth and the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>»Injure neither land nor sea nor trees,« he said, »until we have sealed the bondservants of our God upon their foreheads.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>When the sealing was finished, I heard how many were sealed out of the tribes of the descendants of Israel. They were 144,000.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah, 12,000 were sealed; Of the tribe of Reuben, 12,000; Of the tribe of Gad, 12,000;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>Of the tribe of Asher, 12,000; Of the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000; Of the tribe of Manasseh, 12,000;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.7'>Of the tribe of Symeon, 12,000; Of the tribe of Levi, 12,000; Of the tribe of Issachar, 12,000;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>Of the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000; Of the tribe of Joseph, 12,000; Of the tribe of Benjamin, 12,000.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After this I looked, and a vast host appeared which it was impossible for anyone to count, gathered out of every nation and from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in long white robes, and carrying palm-branches in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>In loud voices they were exclaiming, »It is to our God who is seated on the throne, and to the Lamb, that we owe our salvation!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>All the angels were standing in a circle round the throne and round the Elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshipped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.12'>»Even so!« they cried:»The blessing and the glory and the wisdom and the thanks and the honor and the power and the might are to be ascribed to our God, until the Ages of the Ages! Even so!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>Then, addressing me, one of the Elders said, »Who are these people clothed in the long white robes? And where have they come from?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>»My lord, you know,« I replied. »They are those,« he said, »who have just passed through the great distress, and have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>For this reason they stand before the very throne of God, and render Him service, day after day and night after night, in His sanctuary, and He who is sitting upon the throne will shelter them in His tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.16'>They will never again be hungry or thirsty, and never again will the sun or any scorching heat trouble them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.17'>For the Lamb who is in front of the throne will be their Shepherd, and will guide them to watersprings of Life, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>When the Lamb broke the seventh seal, there was silence in Heaven for about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>Then I saw the seven angels who are in the presence of God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>And another angel came and stood close to the altar, carrying a censer of gold; and abundance of incense was given to him that he might place it with the prayers of all God's people upon the golden altar which was in front of the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>And the smoke of the incense rose into the presence of God from the angel's hand, and mingled with the prayers of His people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>So the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and flung it to the earth; and there followed peals of thunder, and voices, and flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets made preparations for blowing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>The first blew his trumpet; and there came hail and fire, mixed with blood, falling upon the earth; and a third part of the earth was burnt up, and a third part of the trees and all the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>The second angel blew his trumpet; and what seemed to be a great mountain, all ablaze with fire, was hurled into the sea; and a third part of the sea was turned into blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>And a third part of the creatures that were in the sea –those that had life– died; and a third part of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>The third angel blew his trumpet; and there fell from Heaven a great star, which was on fire like a torch. It fell upon a third part of the rivers and upon the springs of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>The name of the star is `Wormwood;' and a third part of the waters were turned into wormwood, and vast numbers of the people died from drinking the water, because it had become bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet; and a curse fell upon a third part of the sun, a third part of the moon, and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them were darkened and for a third of the day, and also of the night, there was no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>Then I looked, and I heard a solitary eagle crying in a loud voice, as it flew across the sky, »Alas, alas, alas, for the inhabitants of the earth, because of the significance of the remaining trumpets which the three angels are about to blow!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>The fifth angel blew his trumpet; and I saw a Star which had fallen from Heaven to the earth; and to him was given the key of the depths of the bottomless pit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>and he opened the depths of the bottomless pit. And smoke came up out of the pit resembling the smoke of a vast furnace, so that the sun was darkened, and the air also, by reason of the smoke of the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>And from the midst of the smoke there came locusts on to the earth, and power was given to them resembling the power which earthly scorpions possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>And they were forbidden to injure the herbage of the earth, or any green thing, or any tree. They were only to injure human beings–those who have not the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>Their mission was not to kill, but to cause awful agony for five months; and this agony was like that which a scorpion inflicts when it stings a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>And at that time people will seek death, but will by no possibility find it, and will long to die, but death evades them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for war. On their heads they had wreaths which looked like gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>Their faces seemed human and they had hair like women's hair, but their teeth resembled those of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>They had breast-plates which seemed to be made of steel; and the noise caused by their wings was like that of a vast number of horses and chariots hurrying into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>They had tails like those of scorpions, and also stings; and in their tails lay their power of injuring mankind for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>The locusts had a king over them–the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in Hebrew is `Abaddon,' while in the Greek he is called `Apollyon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>The first woe is past; two other woes have still to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>The sixth angel blew his trumpet; and I heard a single voice speaking from among the horns of the golden incense altar which is in the presence of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>It said to the sixth angel–the angel who had the trumpet, »Set at liberty the four angels who are prisoners near the great river Euphrates.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>And the four angels who had been kept in readiness for that hour, day, month, and year, were set at liberty, so that they might kill a third part of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>The number of the cavalry was two hundred millions; I heard their number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>And this was the appearance of the horses which I saw in my vision–and of their riders. The body-armour of the riders was red, blue and yellow; and the horses' heads were shaped like the heads of lions, while from their mouths there came fire and smoke and sulphur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three plagues a third part of mankind were destroyed–by the fire and the smoke, and by the sulphur which came from their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails; their tails being like serpents, and having heads, and it is with them that they inflict injury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>But the rest of mankind who were not killed by these plagues, did not even then repent and leave the things they had made, so as to cease worshipping the demons, and the idols of gold and silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which can neither see nor hear, nor move.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>Nor did they repent of their murders, their practice of magic, their fornication, or their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>Then I saw another strong angel coming down from Heaven. He was robed in a cloud, and over his head was the rainbow. His face was like the sun, and his feet resembled pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>In his hand he held a small scroll unrolled; and, planting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>he cried out in a loud voice which resembled the roar of a lion. And when he had cried out, each of the seven peals of thunder uttered its own message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>And when the seven peals of thunder had spoken, I was about to write down what they had said; but I heard a voice from Heaven which told me to keep secret all that the seven peals of thunder had said, and not write it down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>Then the angel that I saw standing on the sea and on the land, lifted his right hand toward Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>And in the name of Him who lives until the Ages of the Ages, the Creator of Heaven and all that is in it, of the earth and all that is in it, and of the sea and all that is in it, he solemnly declared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>»There shall be no further delay; but in the days when the seventh angel blows his trumpet –when he begins to do so– then the secret purposes of God are realized, in accordance with the good news which He gave to His servants the Prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>Then the voice which I had heard speaking from Heaven once more addressed me. It said, »Go and take the little book which lies open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the little book. »Take it,« he said, »and eat the whole of it. You will find it bitter when you have eaten it, although in your mouth it will taste as sweet as honey.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>So I took the roll out of the angel's hand and ate the whole of it; and in my mouth it was as sweet as honey, but when I had eaten it I found it very bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>And a voice said to me, »You must prophesy yet further concerning peoples, nations, languages, and many kings.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>Then a reed was given me to serve as a measuring rod; and a voice said, »Rise, and measure God's sanctuary –and the altar– and count the worshipers who are in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>But as for the court which is outside the sanctuary, pass it over. Do not measure it; for it has been given to the Gentiles, and for forty-two months they will trample the holy city under foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>And I will authorize My two witnesses to prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>»These witnesses are the two olive-trees, and they are the two lamps which stand in the presence of the Lord of the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>And if any one seeks to injure them–fire comes from their mouths and devours their enemies; and if any one seeks to injure them, he will in this way certainly be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>They have power given to them to seal up the sky, so that no rain may fall so long as they continue to prophesy; and power over the waters to turn them into blood, and to smite the earth with various plagues whenever they choose to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>»And when they have fully delivered their testimony, the Wild Beast which is to rise out of the bottomless pit will make war upon them and overcome them and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>And their dead bodies are to lie in the broad street of the great city which spiritually is designated `Sodom' and `Egypt,' where indeed their Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>And men belonging to all peoples, tribes, languages and nations gaze at their dead bodies for three days and a half, but they refuse to let them be laid in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>The inhabitants of the earth rejoice over them and are glad and will send gifts to one another; for these two Prophets had greatly troubled the inhabitants of the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>But at the end of the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them, and they rose to their feet; and all who saw them were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>Then they heard a loud voice calling to them out of Heaven, and bidding them come up; and they went up to Heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>And just as that time there was a great earthquake, and a tenth part of the city was overthrown. 7,000 people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second Woe is past; the third Woe will soon be here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>The seventh angel blew his trumpet; and there followed loud voices in Heaven which said, »The sovereignty of the world now belongs to our Lord and His Christ; and He will be King until the Ages of the Ages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>Then the twenty-four Elders, who sit on thrones in the presence of God, fell on their faces and worshipped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>saying, »We give thee thanks, O Lord God, the Ruler of all, Who art and wast, because Thou hast exerted Thy power, Thy great power, and hast become King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.18'>The nations grew angry, and Thine anger has come, and the time for the dead to be judged, and the time for Thee to give their reward to Thy servants the Prophets and to Thy people, and to those who fear Thee, the small and the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>Then the doors of God's sanctuary in Heaven were opened, and the Ark, in which His Covenant was, was seen in His sanctuary; and there came flashes of lightning, and voices, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake, and heavy hail.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>And a great marvel was seen in Heaven– a woman who was robed with the sun and had the moon under her feet, and had also a wreath of stars round her head, was with child,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>and she was crying out in the pains and agony of childbirth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>And another marvel was seen in Heaven–a great fiery-red Dragon, with seven heads and ten horns; and on his heads were seven kingly crowns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>His tail was drawing after it a third part of the stars of Heaven, and it dashed them to the ground. And in front of the woman who was about to become a mother, the Dragon was standing in order to devour the child as soon as it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>She gave birth to a son–a male child, destined before long to rule all nations with an iron scepter. But her child was caught up to God and His throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.6'>and the woman fled into the Desert, there to be cared for, for 1,260 days, in a place which God had prepared for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>And war broke out in Heaven, Michael and his angels engaging in battle with the Dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>The Dragon fought and so did his angels; but they were defeated, and there was no longer any room found for them in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>The great Dragon, the ancient serpent, he who is called `the Devil' and `the Adversary' and leads the whole earth astray, was hurled down: he was hurled down to the earth, and his angels were hurled down with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>Then I heard a loud voice speaking in Heaven. It said, »The salvation and the power and the Kingdom of our God have now come, and the sovereignty of His Christ; for the accuser of our brethren has been hurled down–he who, day after day and night after night, was wont to accuse them in the presence of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>But they have gained the victory over him because of the blood of the Lamb and of the testimony which they have borne, and because they held their lives cheap and did not shrink even from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.12'>For this reason be glad, O Heaven, and you who live in Heaven! Alas for the earth and the sea! For the Devil has come down to you; full of fierce anger, because he knows that his appointed time is short.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.13'>And when the Dragon saw that he was hurled down to the earth, he went in pursuit of the woman who had given birth to the male child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>Then, the two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman to enable her to fly away into the Desert to the place assigned her, there to be cared for, for a period of time, two periods of time, and half a period of time, beyond the reach of the serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>And the serpent poured water from his mouth –a very river it seemed– after the woman, in the hope that she would be carried away by its flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.16'>But the earth came to the woman's help: it opened its mouth and drank up the river which the Dragon had poured from his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.17'>This made the Dragon furiously angry with the woman, and he went elsewhere to make war upon her other children–those who keep God's commandments and hold fast to the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>And he took up a position upon the sands of the sea-shore. Then I saw a Wild Beast coming up out of the sea, and he had ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten kingly crowns, and inscribed on his heads were names full of blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>The Wild Beast which I saw resembled a leopard, and had feet like the feet of a bear, and his mouth was like the mouth of a lion; and it was to the Dragon that he owed his power and his throne and his wide dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>I saw that one of his heads seemed to have been mortally wounded; but his mortal wound was healed, and the whole world was amazed and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>And they offered worship to the Dragon, because it was to him that the Wild Beast owed his dominion; and they also offered worship to the Wild Beast, and said, »Who is there like him? And who is able to engage in battle with him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>And there was given him a mouth full of boastful and blasphemous words; and liberty of action was granted him for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.6'>And he opened his mouth to utter blasphemies against God, to speak evil of His name and of His dwelling-place–that is to say, of those who dwell in Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.7'>And permission was given him to make war upon God's people and conquer them; and power was given him over every tribe, people, language and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.8'>And all the inhabitants of the earth will be found to be worshipping him: every one whose name is not recorded in the Book of Life–the Book of the Lamb who has been offered in sacrifice ever since the creation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.9'>Let all who have ears give heed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.10'>If any one is eager to lead others into captivity, he must himself go into captivity. If any one is bent on killing with the sword, he must himself be killed by the sword. Here is an opportunity for endurance, and for the exercise of faith, on the part of God's people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.11'>Then I saw another Wild Beast, coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like those of a lamb, but he spoke like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.12'>And the authority of the first Wild Beast –the whole of that authority– he exercises in his presence, and he causes the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first Wild Beast, whose mortal wound had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.13'>He also works great miracles, so as even to make fire come down from Heaven to earth in the presence of human beings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.14'>And his power of leading astray the inhabitants of the earth is due to the marvels which he has been permitted to work in the presence of the Wild Beast. And he told the inhabitants of the earth to erect a statue to the Wild Beast who had received the sword-stroke and yet had recovered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.15'>And power was granted him to give breath to the statue of the Wild Beast, so that the statue of the Wild Beast could even speak and cause all who refuse to worship it to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.16'>And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free men and slaves, to have stamped upon them a mark on their right hands or on their foreheads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.17'>in order that no one should be allowed to buy or sell unless he had the mark–either the name of the Wild Beast or the number which his name represents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.18'>Here is scope for ingenuity. Let people of shrewd intelligence calculate the number of the Wild Beast; for it indicates a certain man, and his number is 666.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.1'>Then I looked, and I saw the Lamb standing upon Mount Zion, and with Him 144,000 people, having His name and His Father's name written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.2'>And I heard music from Heaven which resembled the sound of many waters and the roar of loud thunder; and the music which I heard was like that of harpists playing upon their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.3'>And they were singing what seemed to be a new song, in front of the throne and in the presence of the four living creatures and the Elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the 144,000 people who had been redeemed out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.4'>These are those who had not defiled themselves with women: they are as pure as virgins. They follow the Lamb wherever He goes. They have been redeemed from among men, as firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.14.9'>And another, a third angel, followed them, exclaiming in a loud voice, »If any one worships the Wild Beast and his statue, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.10'>he shall drink the wine of God's anger which stands ready, undiluted, in the cup of His fury, and he shall be tormented with fire and sulphur in the presence of the holy angels and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.11'>And the smoke of their torment goes up until the Ages of the Ages; and the worshipers of the Wild Beast and his statue have no rest day or night, nor has any one who receives the mark of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.12'>Here is an opportunity for endurance on the part of God's people, who carefully keep His commandments and the faith of Jesus!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.13'>And I heard a voice speaking from Heaven. It said, »Write as follows: »`Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from this time onward. Yes, says the Spirit, let them rest from their sorrowful labours; for what they have done goes with them.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.14'>Then I looked, and a white cloud appeared, and sitting on the cloud was some One resembling the Son of Man, having a wreath of gold upon His head and in His hand a sharp sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.15'>And another, an angel, came out of the sanctuary, calling in a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, and saying, »Use your sickle and reap the harvest, for the hour for reaping it has come: the harvest of the earth is over-ripe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.16'>Then He who sat on the cloud flung His sickle on the earth, and the earth had its harvest reaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.17'>And another angel came out from the sanctuary in Heaven, and he too carried a sharp sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.18'>And another angel came out from the altar –he who had power over fire– and he spoke in a loud voice to him who had the sharp sickle, saying, »Use your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches from the vine of the earth, for its grapes are now quite ripe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.19'>And the angel flung his sickle down to the earth, and reaped the vine of the earth and threw the grapes into the great winepress of God's anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.20'>And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and out of it came blood reaching the horses' bridles for a distance of 200 miles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.1'>Then I saw another marvel in Heaven, great and wonderful–there were seven angels bringing seven plagues. These are the last plagues, because in them God's anger has found full expression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.2'>And I saw what seemed to be a sea of glass mingled with fire, and those who had gained the victory over the Wild Beast and over his statue and the number of his name, standing by the sea of glass and having harps which belonged to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.3'>And they were singing the song of Moses, God's servant, and the song of the Lamb. Their words were, »Great and wonderful are Thy works, O Lord God, the Ruler of all. Righteous and true are Thy ways, O King of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.4'>Who shall not be afraid, O Lord, and glorify Thy name? For Thou alone art holy. All nations shall come and shall worship Thee, because the righteousness of all that Thou hast done has been made manifest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.5'>After this, when the doors of the sanctuary of the tent of witness in Heaven were opened, I looked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.6'>and there came out of the sanctuary the seven angels who were bringing the seven plagues. The angels were clad in pure, bright linen, and had girdles of gold across their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.7'>And one of the four living creatures gave the seven angels seven bowls of gold, full of the anger of God who lives until the Ages of the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.8'>And the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from His power; and no one could enter the sanctuary till the seven plagues brought by the seven angels were at an end.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.16'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>Then I heard a loud voice from the sanctuary say to the seven angels, »Go and pour on to the earth the seven bowls of the anger of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>So the first angel went away and poured his bowl on to the earth; and it brought a bad and painful sore upon the men who had on them the mark of the Wild Beast and worshipped his statue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>The second angel poured his bowl into the sea, and it became blood, like a dead man's blood, and every living creature in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and they became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>And I heard the angel of the waters say, »Righteous art Thou, who art and wast, the holy One, because Thou hast thus taken vengeance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>For they poured out the blood of Thy people and of the Prophets, and in return Thou hast given them blood to drink. And this they deserved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>And I heard a voice from the altar say, »Even so, O Lord God, the Ruler of all, true and righteous are Thy judgments.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>Then the fourth angel poured his bowl on to the sun, and power was given to it to scorch men with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>And the men were severely burned; and yet they spoke evil of God who had power over the plagues, and they did not repent so as to give Him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>The fifth angel poured his bowl on to the throne of the Wild Beast; and his kingdom became darkened. People gnawed their tongues because of the pain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>and they spoke evil of the God in Heaven because of their pains and their sores, and did not repent of their misconduct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>The sixth angel poured his bowl into that great river, the Euphrates; and its stream was dried up in order to clear the way for the kings who are to come from the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>Then I saw three foul spirits, resembling frogs, issue from the mouth of the Dragon, from the mouth of the Wild Beast, and from the mouth of the false Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>For they are the spirits of demons working marvels–spirits that go out to control the kings of the whole earth, to assemble them for the battle which is to take place on the great day of God, the Ruler of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.15'>(»I am coming like a thief. Blessed is the man who keeps awake and guards his raiment for fear he walk about ill-clad, and his uncomeliness become manifest.«)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.16'>And assemble them they did at the place called in Hebrew `Har-Magedon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>Then the seventh angel poured his bowl into the air; and a loud voice came out of the sanctuary from the throne, saying, »Everything is now ready.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>Flashes of lightning followed, and voices, and peals of thunder, and an earthquake more dreadful than there had ever been since there was a man upon the earth–so terrible was it, and so great!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>The great city was split into three parts; the cities of the nations fell; and great Babylon came into remembrance before God, for Him to make her drink from the wine-cup of His fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>Every island fled away, and there was not a mountain anywhere to be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>And heavy hail, that seemed to be a talent in weight, fell from the sky upon the people; and they spoke evil of God on account of the plague of the hail–because the plague of it was exceedingly severe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>Then one of the seven angels who were carrying the seven bowls came and spoke to me. »Come with me,« he said, »and I will show you the doom of the great Harlot who sits upon many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>The kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>So he carried me away in the Spirit into a desert, and there I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored Wild Beast which was covered with names of blasphemy and had seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>The woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, and was brilliantly attired with gold and jewels and pearls. She held in her hand a cup of gold, full of abominations, and she gave filthy indications of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>And on her forehead was a name written:»I am a symbol of great Babylon, the mother of the harlots and of the abominations of the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>And I saw the woman drinking herself drunk with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And when I saw her I was filled with utter astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>Then the angel said to me, »Why are you so astonished? I will explain to you the secret meaning of the woman and of the seven-headed, ten-horned Wild Beast which carries her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>»The Wild Beast which you have seen was, and is not, and yet is destined to re-ascend, before long, out of the bottomless pit and go his way into perdition. And the inhabitants of the earth will be filled with amazement –all whose names are not in the Book of Life, having been recorded there ever since the creation of the world– when they see the Wild Beast: because he was, and is not, and yet is to come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>Here is scope for the exercise of a mind that has wisdom! The seven heads are the seven hills on which the woman sits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>And they are seven kings: five of them have fallen, and the one is still reigning. The seventh has not yet come, but when he comes he must continue for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>And the Wild Beast which once existed but does not now exist–he is an eighth king and yet is one of the seven and he goes his way into perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>»And the ten horns which you have seen are ten kings who have not yet come to the throne, but for a single hour they are to receive authority as kings along with the Wild Beast.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>They have one common policy, and they are to give their power and authority to the Wild Beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>They will make war upon the Lamb, and the Lamb will triumph over them; for He is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those who accompany Him –called, as they are, and chosen, and faithful– shall share in the victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>He also said to me, »The waters which you have seen, on which the Harlot sits, are peoples and multitudes, nations and languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>And the ten horns that you have seen –and the Wild Beast– these will hate the Harlot, and they will cause her to be laid waste and will strip her bare. They will eat her flesh, and burn her up with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>For God has put it into their hearts to carry out His purpose, and to carry out a common purpose and to give their kingdom to the Wild Beast until God's words have come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>And the woman whom you have seen is the great city which has kingly power over the kings of the earth.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>After these things I saw another angel coming down from Heaven, armed with great power. The earth shone with his splendor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.2'>and with a mighty voice he cried out, saying, »Great Babylon has fallen, has fallen, and has become a home for demons and a stronghold for every kind of foul spirit and for every kind of foul and hateful bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.3'>For all the nations have drunk the wine of the anger provoked by her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich through her excessive luxury.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>Then I heard another voice from Heaven, which said, »Come out of her, My people, that you may not become partakers in her sins, nor receive a share of her plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>For her sins are piled up to the sky, and God has called to mind her unrighteous deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.6'>Give back to her as she has given; repay her in accordance with her doings, twice as much; in the bowl that she has mixed, mix twice as much for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>She has freely glorified herself and revelled in luxury; equally freely administer torment to her, and woe. For in her heart she boasts, saying, `I sit enthroned as Queen: no widow am I: I shall never know sorrow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>»For this reason calamities shall come thick upon her on a single day –death and sorrow and famine– and she shall be burned to the ground. For strong is the Lord God who has judged her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>The kings of the earth who have committed fornication with her, and have revelled in luxury, shall weep aloud and lament over her when they see the smoke of her burning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.10'>while they stand afar off because of their terror at her heavy punishment, and say, `Alas, alas, thou great city, O Babylon, the mighty city! For in one short hour thy doom has come!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>And the merchants of the earth weep aloud and lament over her, because now there is no sale for their cargoes–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>cargoes of gold and silver, of jewels and pearls, of fine linen, purple and silk, and of scarlet stuff; all kinds of rare woods, and all kinds of goods in ivory and in very costly wood, in bronze, steel and marble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>Also cinnamon and amomum; odors to burn as incense or for perfume; frankincense, wine, oil; fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep; horses and carriages and slaves; and the lives of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>The dainties that thy soul longed for are gone from thee, and all thine elegance and splendor have perished, and never again shall they be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>Those who traded in these things, who grew wealthy through her, will stand afar off, struck with terror at her punishment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.16'>weeping aloud and sorrowing, and saying, `Alas, alas, for this great city, which was brilliantly arrayed in fine linen, and purple and scarlet stuff, and beautified with gold, jewels and pearls;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>because in one short hour all this great wealth has been laid waste!' And every shipmaster and every passenger by sea and the crews and all who ply their trade on the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>stood afar off, and cried aloud when they saw the smoke of her burning. And they said, `What city is like this great city?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>And they threw dust upon their heads, and cried out, weeping aloud and sorrowing. `Alas, alas,' they said, `for this great city, in which, through her vast wealth, the owners of all the ships on the sea have grown rich; because in one short hour she has been laid waste!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>Rejoice over her, O Heaven, and you saints and Apostles and Prophets; for God has taken vengeance upon her because of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>Then a single angel of great strength took a stone which resembled a huge millstone, and hurled it into the sea, saying, »So shall Babylon, that great city, be violently hurled down and never again be found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>No harp or song, no flute or trumpet, shall ever again be heard in thee; no craftsman of any kind shall ever again be found in thee; nor shall the grinding of the mill ever again be heard in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>Never again shall the light of a lamp shine in thee, and never again shall the voice of a bridegroom or of a bride be heard in thee. For thy merchants were the great men of the earth, and with the magic which thou didst practise all nations were led astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>And in her was found the blood of Prophets and of God's people and of all who had been put to death on the earth.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.19'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>After this I seemed to hear the far-echoing voices of a great multitude in Heaven, who said, »Hallelujah! The salvation and the glory and the power belong to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>True and just are His judgments, because He has judged the great Harlot who was corrupting the whole earth with her fornication, and He has taken vengeance for the blood of His bondservants which her hands have shed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>And a second time they said, »Hallelujah! For her smoke ascends until the Ages of the Ages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>And the twenty-four Elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshipped God who sits upon the throne. »Even so,« they said; »Hallelujah!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.5'>And from the throne there came a voice which said, »Praise our God, all you His bondservants–you who fear Him, both the small and the great.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.6'>And I seemed to hear the voices of a great multitude and the sound of many waters and of loud peals of thunder, which said, »Hallelujah! Because the Lord our God, the Ruler of all, has become King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.7'>Let us rejoice and triumph and give Him the glory; for the time for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and His Bride has made herself ready.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>And she was permitted to array herself in fine linen, shining and spotless; the fine linen being the righteous actions of God's people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>And he said to me, »Write as follows: `Blessed are those who receive an invitation to the Marriage Supper of the Lamb.'« And he added, still addressing me, »These are truly the words of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>Then I fell at his feet to worship him. But he exclaimed, »Oh, do not do that. I am a fellow bondservant of yours and a fellow bondservant of your brethren who have borne testimony to Jesus. Worship God.« Testimony to Jesus is the spirit which underlies Prophecy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>Then I saw a door open in Heaven, and a white horse appeared. Its rider was named »Faithful and True« –being One who in righteousness acts as Judge, and makes war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>His eyes were like a flame of fire, and on His head were many kingly crowns; and He has a name written upon Him which no one but He Himself knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>The outer garment in which He is clad has been dipped in blood and His name is THE WORD OF GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.14'>The armies in Heaven followed Him–mounted on white horses and clothed in fine linen, white and spotless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>From His mouth there comes a sharp sword with which He will smite the nations; and He will Himself be their Shepherd, ruling them with a scepter of iron; and it is His work to tread the winepress of the fierce anger of God, the Ruler of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.16'>And on His outer garment and on His thigh He has a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>And I saw a single angel standing in the full light of the sun, who cried in a loud voice to all the birds that flew across the sky, »Come and be present at God's great supper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.18'>that you may feast on the flesh of kings and the flesh of generals and the flesh of mighty men, on the flesh of horses and their riders, and on the flesh of all mankind, whether they are free men or slaves, great men or small.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>And I saw the Wild Beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies, all assembled to make war, once for all, against the Rider upon the horse and against His army. And the Wild Beast was captured, and with him the false Prophet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>who had done the miracles in his presence with which he had led astray those who had received the mark of the Wild Beast, and those who worshipped his statue. Both of them were thrown alive into the Lake of fire that was all ablaze with sulphur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.21'>But the rest were killed with the sword that came from the mouth of the Rider on the horse. And the birds all fed ravenously upon their flesh.</verse>

And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded on account of the testimony that they had borne to Jesus and on account of God's Message, and also the souls of those who had not worshipped the Wild Beast or his statue, nor received his mark on their foreheads or on their hands; and they came to Life and were kings with Christ for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.5'>No one else who was dead rose to Life until the thousand years were at an end. This is the First Resurrection.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.20.13'>Then the sea yielded up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades yielded up the dead who were in them, and each man was judged in accordance with what his conduct had been.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.12'>It has a wall, massive and high, with twelve large gates, and in charge of the gates were twelve angels. And overhead, above the gates, names were inscribed which are those of the twelve tribes of the descendants of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.13'>There were three gates on the east, three on the north, three on the south, and three on the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.14'>The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and engraved upon them were twelve names–the names of the twelve Apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.15'>Now he who was speaking to me had a measuring-rod of gold, with which to measure the city and its gates and its wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.16'>The plan of the city is a square, the length being the same as the breadth; and he measured the city furlong by furlong, with his measuring rod–it is twelve hundred miles long, and the length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.17'>And he measured the wall of it–a wall of a hundred and forty-four cubits, according to human measure, which was also that of the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.18'>The solid fabric of the wall was jasper; and the city itself was made of gold, resembling transparent glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.19'>As for the foundation-stones of the city wall, which were beautified with various kinds of precious stones, the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald, the fifth sardonyx, the sixth sardius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.20'>the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>And the twelve gates were twelve pearls; each of them consisting of a single pearl. And the main street of the city was made of pure gold, resembling transparent glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>I saw no sanctuary in the city, for the Lord God, the Ruler of all, is its Sanctuary, and so is the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>Nor has the city any need of the sun or of the moon, to give it light; for the glory of God has shone upon it and its lamp is the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'>The nations will live their lives by its light; and the kings of the earth are to bring their glory into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.25'>And in the daytime (for there will be no night there) the gates will never be closed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.26'>and the glory and honor of the nations shall be brought into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.27'>And no unclean thing shall ever enter it, nor any one who is guilty of base conduct or tells lies, but only they whose names stand recorded in the Lamb's Book of Life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>Then he showed me the river of the Water of Life, bright as crystal, issuing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>On either side of the river, midway between it and the main street of the city, was the Tree of Life. It produced twelve kinds of fruit, yielding a fresh crop month by month, and the leaves of the tree served as medicine for the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>»In future there will be no curse,« he said, »but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in that city. And His servants will render Him holy service and will see His face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>and His name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And there will be no night there; and they have no need of lamplight or sunlight, for the Lord God will shine upon them, and they will be kings until the Ages of the Ages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>And he said to me, »These words are trustworthy and true; and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the Prophets, sent His angel to make known to His servants the things which must soon happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>`I am coming quickly.' Blessed is he who is mindful of the predictions contained in this book.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>I John heard and saw these things; and when I had heard and seen them, I fell at the feet of the angel who was showing me them–to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>But he said to me, »Oh, do not do that. I am a fellow bondservant of yours, and a fellow bondservant of your brethren the Prophets and of those who are mindful of the teachings of this book. Worship God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>»Make no secret,« he added, »of the meaning of the predictions contained in this book; for the time for their fulfillment is now close at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>Let the dishonest man act dishonestly still; let the filthy make himself filthy still; let the righteous practise righteousness still; and let the holy be made holy still.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>»I am coming quickly; and My reward is with Me, that I may requite every man in accordance with what his conduct has been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>Blessed are those who wash their robes clean, that they may have a right to the Tree of Life, and may go through the gates into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>The unclean are shut out, and so are all who practise magic, all fornicators, all murderers, and those who worship idols, and every one who loves falsehood and tells lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>»I Jesus have sent My angel for him solemnly to declare these things to you among the Churches. I am the Root and the offspring of David, the bright Morning Star.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>The Spirit and the Bride say, `Come;' and whoever hears, let him say, `Come;' and let those who are thirsty come. Whoever will, let him take the Water of Life, without payment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>»I solemnly declare to every one who hears the words of the prophecy contained in this book, that if any one adds to those words, God will add to him the plagues spoken of in this book;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>and that if any one takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take from him his share in the Tree of Life and in the holy city–the things described in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>»He who solemnly declares all this says,« `Yes, I am coming quickly.' Amen. Come, Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's people.</verse>
