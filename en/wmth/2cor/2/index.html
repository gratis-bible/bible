For we are not ignorant of his devices.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Now when I came into the Troad to spread there the Good News about the Christ, even though in the Lord's providence a door stood open before me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>yet, obtaining no relief for my spirit because I did not find our brother Titus, I bade them farewell and went on into Macedonia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But to God be the thanks who in Christ ever heads our triumphal procession, and by our hands waves in every place that sweet incense, the knowledge of Him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For we are a fragrance of Christ grateful to God in those whom He is saving and in those who are perishing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>to the last-named an odor of death predictive of death, and to the others an odor of life predictive of life. And for such service as this who is competent?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>We are; for, unlike most teachers, we are not fraudulent hucksters of God's Message; but with transparent motives, as commissioned by God, in God's presence and in communion with Christ, so we speak.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
