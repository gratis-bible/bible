You desire –do you not?– to have no reason to fear your ruler. Well, do the thing that is right, and then he will commend you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>For he is God's servant for your benefit. But if you do what is wrong, be afraid. He does not wear the sword to no purpose: he is God's servant–an administrator to inflict punishment upon evil-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>We must obey therefore, not only in order to escape punishment, but also for conscience' sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Why, this is really the reason you pay taxes; for tax-gatherers are ministers of God, devoting their energies to this very work.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Pay promptly to all men what is due to them: taxes to those to whom taxes are due, toll to those to whom toll is due, respect to those to whom respect is due, honour to those to whom honour is due.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Owe nothing to any one except mutual love; for he who loves his fellow man has satisfied the demands of Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>For the precepts, »Thou shalt not commit adultery,« »Thou shalt do no murder,«»Thou shalt not steal,«»Thou shalt not covet,« and all other precepts, are summed up in this one command, »Thou shalt love thy fellow man as much as thou lovest thyself.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Love avoids doing any wrong to one's fellow man, and is therefore complete obedience to Law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Carry out these injunctions because you know the critical period at which we are living, and that it is now high time, to rouse yourselves from sleep; for salvation is now nearer to us than when we first became believers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The night is far advanced, and day is about to dawn. We must therefore lay aside the deeds of darkness, and clothe ourselves with the armour of Light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Living as we do in broad daylight, let us conduct ourselves becomingly, not indulging in revelry and drunkenness, nor in lust and debauchery, nor in quarrelling and jealousy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>On the contrary, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for gratifying your earthly cravings.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
