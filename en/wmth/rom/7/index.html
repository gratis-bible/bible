Is the Law itself a sinful thing? No, indeed; on the contrary, unless I had been taught by the Law, I should have known nothing of sin as sin. For instance, I should not have known what covetousness is, if the Law had not repeatedly said, »Thou shalt not covet.«</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Sin took advantage of this, and by means of the Commandment stirred up within me every kind of coveting; for apart from Law sin would be dead.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Once, apart from Law, I was alive, but when the Commandment came, sin sprang into life, and I died;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and, as it turned out, the very Commandment which was to bring me life, brought me death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>For sin seized the advantage, and by means of the Commandment it completely deceived me, and also put me to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>So that the Law itself is holy, and the Commandment is holy, just and good.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Did then a thing which is good become death to me? No, indeed, but sin did; so that through its bringing about death by means of what was good, it might be seen in its true light as sin, in order that by means of the Commandment the unspeakable sinfulness of sin might be plainly shown.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>For we know that the Law is a spiritual thing; but I am unspiritual–the slave, bought and sold, of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For what I do, I do not recognize as my own action. What I desire to do is not what I do, but what I am averse to is what I do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But if I do that which I do not desire to do, I admit the excellence of the Law,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>and now it is no longer I that do these things, but the sin which has its home within me does them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For I know that in me, that is, in my lower self, nothing good has its home; for while the will to do right is present with me, the power to carry it out is not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For what I do is not the good thing that I desire to do; but the evil thing that I desire not to do, is what I constantly do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But if I do that which I desire not to do, it can no longer be said that it is I who do it, but the sin which has its home within me does it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I find therefore the law of my nature to be that when I desire to do what is right, evil is lying in ambush for me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For in my inmost self all my sympathy is with the Law of God;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>but I discover within me a different Law at war with the Law of my understanding, and leading me captive to the Law which is everywhere at work in my body–the Law of sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>(Unhappy man that I am! who will rescue me from this death-burdened body?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord!) To sum up then, with my understanding, I –my true self– am in servitude to the Law of God, but with my lower nature I am in servitude to the Law of sin.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
