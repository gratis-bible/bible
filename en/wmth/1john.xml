      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>That which was from the beginning, which we have listened to, which we have seen with our own eyes, and our own hands have handled concerning the Word of Life–</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>the Life was manifested, and we have seen and bear witness, and we declare unto you the Life of the Ages which was with the Father and was manifested to us–</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>that which we have seen and listened to we now announce to you also, in order that you also may have fellowship in it with us, and this fellowship with us is fellowship with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And we write these things in order that our joy may be made complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>This is the Message which we have heard from the Lord Jesus and now deliver to you–God is Light, and in Him there is no darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If, while we are living in darkness, we profess to have fellowship with Him, we speak falsely and are not adhering to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>But if we live in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son, cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we claim to be already free from sin, we lead ourselves astray and the truth has no place in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, He is so faithful and just that He forgives us our sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we deny that we have sinned, we make Him a liar, and His Message has no place in our hearts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>Dear children, I write thus to you in order that you may not sin. If any one sins, we have an Advocate with the Father–Jesus Christ the righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>and He is an atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>And by this we may know that we know Him–if we obey His commands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He who professes to know Him, and yet does not obey His commands, is a liar, and the truth has no place in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But whoever obeys His Message, in him love for God has in very deed reached perfection. By this we can know that we are in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>The man who professes to be continuing in Him is himself also bound to live as He lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>My dearly-loved friends, it is no new command that I am now giving you, but an old command which you have had from the very beginning. By the old command I mean the teaching which you have already received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>And yet I am giving you a new command, for such it really is, so far as both He and you are concerned: because the darkness is now passing away and the light, the true light, is already beginning to shine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>Any one who professes to be in the light and yet hates his brother man is still in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loves his brother man continues in the light, and his life puts no stumbling-block in the way of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he who hates his brother man is in darkness and is walking in darkness; and he does not know where he is going–because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I am writing to you, dear children, because for His sake your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I am writing to you, fathers, because you know Him who has existed from the very beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the Evil one. I have written to you, children, because you know the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I have written to you, fathers, because you know Him who has existed from the very beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong and God's Message still has a place in your hearts, and you have overcome the Evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. If any one loves the world, there is no love in his heart for the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>For the things in the world –the cravings of the earthly nature, the cravings of the eyes, the show and pride of life– they all come, not from the Father, but from the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world, with its cravings, is passing away, but he who does God's will continues for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Dear children, the last hour has come; and as you once heard that there was to be an anti-Christ, so even now many anti-Christs have appeared. By this we may know that the last hour has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They have gone forth from our midst, but they did not really belong to us; for had they belonged to us, they would have remained with us. But they left us that it might be manifest that professed believers do not all belong to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>As for you, you have an anointing from the holy One and have perfect knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I have written to you, not because you are ignorant of the truth, but because you know it, and you know that nothing false comes from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is a liar compared with him who denies that Jesus is the Christ? He who disowns the Father and the Son is the anti-Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>No one who disowns the Son has the Father. He who acknowledges the Son has also the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>As for you, let the teaching which you have received from the very beginning continue in your hearts. If that teaching does continue in your hearts, you also will continue to be in union with the Son and with the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise which He Himself has given us–the Life of the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>I have thus written to you concerning those who are leading you astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>And as for you, the anointing which you received from Him remains within you, and there is no need for any one to teach you. But since His anointing gives you instruction in all things –and is true and is no falsehood– you are continuing in union with Him even as it has taught you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, dear children, continue in union with Him; so that, if He re-appears, we may have perfect confidence, and may not shrink away in shame from His presence at His Coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>Since you know that He is righteous, be assured also that the man who habitually acts righteously is a child of His.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>See what marvellous love the Father has bestowed upon us –that we should be called God's children: and that is what we are. For this reason the world does not recognize us– because it has not known Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Dear friends, we are now God's children, but what we are to be in the future has not yet been fully revealed. We know that if Christ reappears we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And every man who has this hope fixed on Him, purifies himself so as to be as pure as He is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Every one who is guilty of sin is also guilty of violating Law; for sin is the violation of Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And you know that He appeared in order to take away sins; and in Him there is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>No one who continues in union with Him lives in sin: no one who lives in sin has seen Him or knows Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Dear children, let no one lead you astray. The man who acts righteously is righteous, just as He is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He who is habitually guilty of sin is a child of the Devil, because the Devil has been a sinner from the very beginning. The Son of God appeared for the purpose of undoing the work of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>No one who is a child of God is habitually guilty of sin. A God-given germ of life remains in him, and he cannot habitually sin–because he is a child of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>By this we can distinguish God's children and the Devil's children: no one who fails to act righteously is a child of God, nor he who does not love his brother man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>For this is the Message you have heard from the beginning–that we are to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>We are not to resemble Cain, who was a child of the Evil one and killed his own brother. And why did he kill him? Because his own actions were wicked and his brother's actions righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not be surprised, brethren, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>As for us, we know that we have already passed out of death into Life–because we love our brother men. He who is destitute of love continues dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Every one who hates his brother man is a murderer; and you know that no murderer has the Life of the Ages continuing in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>We know what love is–through Christ's having laid down His life on our behalf; and in the same way we ought to lay down our lives for our brother men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But if any one has this world's wealth and sees that his brother man is in need, and yet hardens his heart against him–how can such a one continue to love God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>Dear children, let us not love in words only nor with the lips, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And in this way we shall come to know that we are loyal to the truth, and shall satisfy our consciences in His presence</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>in whatever matters our hearts condemn us–because God is greater than our hearts and knows everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have perfect confidence towards God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>and whatever we ask for we obtain from Him, because we obey His commands and do the things which are pleasing in His sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is His command–that we are to believe in His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as He has commanded us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>The man who obeys His commands continues in union with God, and God continues in union with him; and through His Spirit whom He has given us we can know that He continues in union with us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Dear friends, do not believe every spirit, but put the spirits to the test to see whether they are from God; for many false teachers have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>The test by which you may recognize the Spirit of God is that every spirit which acknowledges that Jesus Christ has come as man is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>and that no spirit is from God which does not acknowledge this about Jesus. Such is the spirit of the anti-Christ; of whose coming you have heard, and it is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>As for you, dear children, you are God's children, and have successfully resisted them; for greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They are the world's children, and so their language is that of the world, and the world listens to them. We are God's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>The man who is beginning to know God listens to us, but he who is not a child of God does not listen to us. By this test we can distinguish the Spirit of truth from the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Dear friends, let us love one another; for love has its origin in God, and every one who loves has become a child of God and is beginning to know God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>He who is destitute of love has never had any knowledge of God; because God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>God's love for us has been manifested in that He has sent His only Son into the world so that we may have Life through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>This is love indeed–we did not love God, but He loved us and sent His Son to be an atoning sacrifice for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Dear friends, if God has so loved us, we also ought to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No one has ever yet seen God. If we love one another, God continues in union with us, and His love in all its perfection is in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>We can know that we are continuing in union with Him and that He is continuing in union with us, by the fact that He has given us a portion of His Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and bear witness that the Father has sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whoever acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God–God continues in union with him, and he continues in union with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>And, as for us, we know the love which God has for us, and we confide in it. God is love, and he who continues to love continues in union with God, and God continues in union with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>Our love will be manifested in all its perfection by our having complete confidence on the day of the Judgement; because just what He is, we also are in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>Love has in it no element of fear; but perfect love drives away fear, because fear involves pain, and if a man gives way to fear, there is something imperfect in his love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love because God first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If any one says that he loves God, while he hates his brother man, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother man whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>And the command which we have from Him is that he who loves God must love his brother man also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Every one who believes that Jesus is the Christ is a child of God; and every one who loves the Father loves also Him who is the Father's Child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>The fact that we love God Himself, and obey His commands, is a proof that we love God's children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>Love for God means obedience to His commands; and His commands are not irksome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>For every child of God overcomes the world; and the victorious principle which has overcome the world is our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who but the man that believes that Jesus is the Son of God overcomes the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>Jesus Christ is He who came with water and blood; not with the water only, but with the water and with the blood. And it is the Spirit who gives testimony– because the Spirit is the Truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>For there are three that give testimony– the Spirit, the water, and the blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>and there is complete agreement between these three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we accept the testimony of men, God's testimony is greater: for God's testimony consists of the things which He has testified about His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in his own heart: he who does not believe God has made Him a liar, in that he has refused to accept the testimony which God has given about His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>And that testimony is to the effect that God has given us the Life of the Ages, and that this Life is in His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He who has the Son has the Life: he who has not the Son of God has not the Life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>I write all this to you in order that you who believe in the Son of God may know for certain that you already have the Life of the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And we have an assured confidence that whenever we ask anything in accordance with His will, He listens to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And since we know that He listens to us, then whatever we ask, we know that we have the things which we have asked from Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If any one sees a brother man committing a sin which is not unto death, he shall ask and God shall give him life–for those who do not sin unto death. There is such a thing as sin unto death; for that I do not bid him make request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>Any kind of wrongdoing is sin; but there is sin which is not unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that no one who is a child of God lives in sin, but He who is God's Child keeps him, and the Evil one cannot touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we are children of God, and that the whole world lies in the power of the Evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>And we know that the Son of God has come, and has given us understanding so that we know the true One, and are in union with the true One–that is, we are in union with His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and the Life of the Ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Dear children, guard yourselves from idols.</verse>
