  <div osisID='Acts' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>My former narrative, Theophilus, dealt with all that Jesus did and taught as a beginning, down to the day on which,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>after giving instruction through the Holy Spirit to the Apostles whom He had chosen, He was taken up to Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>He had also, after He suffered, shown Himself alive to them with many sure proofs, appearing to them at intervals during forty days, and speaking of the Kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And while in their company He charged them not to leave Jerusalem, but to wait for the Father's promised gift. »This you have heard of,« He said, »from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John indeed baptized with water, but before many days have passed you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>Once when they were with Him, they asked Him, »Master, is this the time at which you are about to restore the kingdom of Israel?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>»It is not for you,« He replied, »to know times or epochs which the Father has reserved within His own authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>and yet you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judaea and Samaria and to the remotest parts of the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>When He had said this, and while they were looking at Him, He was carried up, and a cloud closing beneath Him hid Him from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>But, while they stood intently gazing into the sky as He went, suddenly there were two men in white garments standing by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who said, »Galilaeans, why stand looking into the sky? This same Jesus who has been taken up from you into Heaven will come in just the same way as you have seen Him going into Heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called the Oliveyard, which is near Jerusalem, about a mile off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>They entered the city, and they went up to the upper room which was now their fixed place for meeting. Their names were Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>All of these with one mind continued earnest in prayer, together with some women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and His brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>It was on one of these days that Peter stood up in the midst of the brethren –the entire number of persons present being about 120– and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>»Brethren, it was necessary that the Scripture should be fulfilled–the prediction, I mean, which the Holy Spirit uttered by the lips of David, about Judas, who acted as guide to those who arrested Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For Judas was reckoned as one of our number, and a share in this ministry was allotted to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>(Now having bought a piece of ground with the money paid for his wickedness he fell there with his face downwards, and, his body bursting open, he became disembowelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>This fact became widely known to the people of Jerusalem, so that the place received the name, in their language, of Achel-damach, which means `The Field of Blood.')</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>»For it is written in the Book of Psalms,« `Let his encampment be desolate: let there be no one to dwell there'; and `His work let another take up.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>»It is necessary, therefore, that of the men who have been with us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning from His baptism by John down to the day on which He was taken up again from us into Heaven–one should be appointed to become a witness with us as to His resurrection.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>So two names were proposed, Joseph called Bar-sabbas –and surnamed Justus– and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And the brethren prayed, saying, »Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, show clearly which of these two Thou hast chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to occupy the place in this ministry and Apostleship from which Judas through transgression fell, in order to go to his own place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>Then they drew lots between them. The lot fell on Matthias, and a place among the eleven Apostles was voted to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>At length, on the day of the Harvest Festival, they had all met in one place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>when suddenly there came from the sky a sound as of a strong rushing blast of wind. This filled the whole house where they were sitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>and they saw tongues of what looked like fire distributing themselves over the assembly, and on the head of each person a tongue alighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>They were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in foreign languages according as the Spirit gave them words to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now there were Jews residing in Jerusalem, devout men from every part of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>So when this noise was heard, they came crowding together, and were amazed because everyone heard his own language spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>They were beside themselves with wonder, and exclaimed, »Are not all these speakers Galilaeans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>How then does each of us hear his own native language spoken by them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Some of us are Parthians, Medes, Elamites. Some are inhabitants of Mesopotamia, of Judaea or Cappadocia, of Pontus or the Asian Province, of Phrygia or Pamphylia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>of Egypt or of the parts of Africa towards Cyrene. Others are visitors from Rome –being either Jews or converts from heathenism– and others are Cretans or Arabians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Yet we all alike hear these Galilaeans speaking in our own language about the wonderful things which God has done.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>They were all astounded and bewildered, and asked one another, »What can this mean?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others, scornfully jeering, said, »They are brim-full of sweet wine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Peter however, together with the Eleven, stood up and addressed them in a loud voice. »Men of Judaea, and all you inhabitants of Jerusalem,« he said, »be in no uncertainty about this matter but pay attention to what I say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>For this is not intoxication, as you suppose, it being only the third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But that which was predicted through the Prophet Joel has happened:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it shall come to pass in the last days, God says, that I will pour out My Spirit upon all mankind; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall have dreams;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>and even upon My bondservants, both men and women, at that time, I will pour out My Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>I will display marvels in the sky above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire, and pillars of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun shall be turned into darkness and the moon into blood, to usher in the day of the Lord– that great and illustrious day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>and every one who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.'–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>»Listen, Israelites, to what I say. Jesus, the Nazarene, a man accredited to you from God by miracles and marvels and signs which God did among you through Him, as you yourselves know, Him–«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>delivered up through God's settled purpose and foreknowledge–you by the hands of Gentiles have nailed to a cross and have put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>But God has raised Him to life, having terminated the throes of death, for in fact it was not possible for Him to be held fast by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David says in reference to Him, »`I constantly fixed my eyes upon the Lord, because He is at my right hand in order that I may continue unshaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>For this reason my heart is glad and my tongue exults. My body also shall rest in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>For Thou wilt not leave me in the Unseen World forsaken, nor give up Thy holy One to undergo decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou hast made known to me the ways of Life: Thou wilt fill me with gladness in Thy presence.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>»As to the patriarch David, I need hardly remind you, brethren, that he died and was buried, and that we still have his tomb among us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Being a Prophet, however, and knowing that God had solemnly sworn to him to seat a descendant of his upon his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>with prophetic foresight he spoke of the resurrection of the Christ, to the effect that He was not left forsaken in the Unseen World, nor did His body undergo decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus, God has raised to life– a fact to which all of us testify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>»Being therefore lifted high by the mighty hand of God, He has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and has poured out this which you see and hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David did not ascend into Heaven, but he says himself, »`The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>until I make thy foes a footstool under thy feet.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>»Therefore let the whole House of Israel know beyond all doubt that God has made Him both LORD and CHRIST–this Jesus whom you crucified.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Stung to the heart by these words, they said to Peter and the rest of the Apostles, »Brethren, what are we to do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>»Repent,« replied Peter, »and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, with a view to the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For to you belongs the promise, and to your children, and to all who are far off, whoever the Lord our God may call.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many more appeals he solemnly warned and entreated them, saying, »Escape from this crooked generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Those, therefore, who joyfully welcomed his Message were baptized; and on that one day about three thousand persons were added to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>and they were constant in listening to the teaching of the Apostles and in their attendance at the Communion, that is, the Breaking of the Bread, and at prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>Fear came upon every one, and many marvels and signs were done by the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all the believers kept together, and had everything in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They sold their lands and other property, and distributed the proceeds among all, according to every one's necessities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And, day by day, attending constantly in the Temple with one accord, and breaking bread in private houses, they took their meals with great happiness and single-heartedness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God and being regarded with favour by all the people. Also, day by day, the Lord added to their number those whom He was saving.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>One day Peter and John were going up to the Temple for the hour of prayer –the ninth hour– and, just then,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>some men were carrying there one who had been lame from birth, whom they were wont to place every day close to the Beautiful Gate (as it was called) of the Temple, for him to beg from the people as they went in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>Seeing Peter and John about to go into the Temple, he asked them for alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Peter fixing his eyes on him, as John did also, said, »Look at us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>So he looked and waited, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>»I have no silver or gold,« Peter said, »but what I have, I give you. In the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene– walk!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>Then taking his hand Peter lifted him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>Leaping up, he stood upright and began to walk, and went into the Temple with them, walking, leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>All the people saw him walking and praising God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>and recognizing him as the man who used to sit at the Beautiful Gate of the Temple asking for alms, they were filled with awe and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>While he still clung to Peter and John, the people, awe-struck, ran up crowding round them in what was known as Solomon's Portico.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>Peter, seeing this, spoke to the people. »Israelites,« he said, »why do you wonder at this man? Or why gaze at us, as though by any power or piety of our own we had enabled him to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our forefathers, has conferred this honour on His Servant Jesus, whom you delivered up and disowned in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to let Him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>Yes, you disowned the holy and righteous One, and asked as a favour the release of a murderer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>The Prince of Life you put to death; but God has raised Him from the dead, and we are witnesses as to that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>It is His name – faith in that name being the condition– which has strengthened this man whom you behold and know; and the faith which He has given has made this man sound and strong again, as you can all see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>»And now, brethren, I know that it was in ignorance that you did it, as was the case with your rulers also.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But in this way God has fulfilled the declarations He made through all the Prophets, that His Christ would suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent, therefore, and reform your lives, so that the record of your sins may be cancelled, and that there may come seasons of revival from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and that He may send the Christ appointed beforehand for you–even Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>Heaven must receive Him until those times of which God has spoken from the earliest ages through the lips of His holy Prophets–the times of the reconstitution of all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>Moses declared, »`The Lord your God will raise up a Prophet for you from among your brethren as He has raised me. In all that He says to you, you must listen to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And every one, without exception, who refuses to listen to that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the People.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>Yes, and all the Prophets, from Samuel onwards –all who have spoken– have also announced the coming of this present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>»You are the heirs of the Prophets, and of the Covenant which God made with your forefathers when He said to Abraham, `And through your posterity all the families of the world shall be blessed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>It is to you first that God, after raising His Servant from the grave, has sent Him to bless you, by causing every one of you to turn from your wickedness.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>While they were saying this to the people, the Priests, the Commander of the Temple Guard, and the Sadducees came upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>highly incensed at their teaching the people and proclaiming in the case of Jesus the Resurrection from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>They arrested the two Apostles and lodged them in custody till the next day; for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who had listened to their preaching believed; and the number of the adult men had now grown to be about 5,000.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>The next day a meeting was held in Jerusalem of their Rulers, Elders, and Scribes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>with Annas the High Priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the other members of the high-priestly family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>So they made the Apostles stand in the centre, and demanded of them, »By what power or in what name have you done this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he replied, »Rulers and Elders of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if we to-day are under examination concerning the benefit conferred on a man helplessly lame, as to how this man has been cured;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that through the name of Jesus the Anointed, the Nazarene, whom you crucified, but whom God has raised from among the dead– through that name this man stands here before you in perfect health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This Jesus is the Stone treated with contempt by you the builders, but it has been made the Cornerstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And in no other is the great salvation to be found; for, in fact, there is no second name under Heaven that has been given among men through which we are to be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>As they looked on Peter and John so fearlessly outspoken –and also discovered that they were illiterate persons, untrained in the schools– they were surprised; and now they recognized them as having been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And seeing the man standing with them –the man who had been cured– they had no reply to make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>So they ordered them to withdraw from the Sanhedrin while they conferred among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>»What are we to do with these men?« they asked one another; for the fact that a remarkable miracle has been performed by them is well known to every one in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But to prevent the matter spreading any further among the people, let us stop them by threats from speaking in the future in this name to any one whatever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>So they recalled the Apostles, and ordered them altogether to give up speaking or teaching in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John replied, »Judge whether it is right in God's sight to listen to you instead of listening to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>As for us, what we have seen and heard we cannot help speaking about.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>The Court added further threats and then let them go, being quite unable to find any way of punishing them on account of the people, because all gave God the glory for the thing that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man was over forty years of age on whom this miracle of restoration to health had been performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>After their release the two Apostles went to their friends, and told them all that the High Priests and Elders had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And they, upon hearing the story, all lifted up their voices to God and said, »O Sovereign Lord, it is Thou who didst make Heaven and earth and sea, and all that is in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>and didst say through the Holy Spirit by the lips of our forefather David Thy servant, »`Why have the nations stamped and raged, and the peoples formed futile plans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth came near, and the rulers assembled together against the Lord and against His Anointed.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>»They did indeed assemble in this city in hostility to Thy holy Servant Jesus whom Thou hadst anointed –Herod and Pontius Pilate with the Gentiles and also the tribes of Israel–«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do all that Thy power and Thy will had predetermined should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now, Lord, listen to their threats, and enable Thy servants to proclaim Thy Message with fearless courage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>whilst Thou stretchest out Thine arm to cure men, and to give signs and marvels through the name of Thy holy Servant Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>When they had prayed, the place in which they were assembled shook, and they were, one and all, filled with the Holy Spirit, and proceeded to tell God's Message with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>Among all those who had embraced the faith there was but one heart and soul, so that none of them claimed any of his possessions as his own, but everything they had was common property;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>while the Apostles with great force of conviction delivered their testimony as to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>And, in fact, there was not a needy man among them, for all who were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the money which they realised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and gave it to the Apostles, and distribution was made to every one according to his wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>In this way Joseph, whom the Apostles gave the name of Bar-nabas –signifying `Son of Encouragement'– a Levite, a native of Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>sold a farm which he had, and brought the money and gave it to the Apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>There was a man of the name of Ananias who, with his wife Sapphira, sold some property but,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>with her full knowledge and consent, dishonestly kept back part of the price which he received for it, though he brought the rest and gave it to the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>»Ananias,« said Peter, »why has Satan taken possession of your heart, that you should try to deceive the Holy Spirit and dishonestly keep back part of the price paid you for this land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>While it remained unsold, was not the land your own? And when sold, was it not at your own disposal? How is it that you have cherished this design in your heart? It is not to men you have told this lie, but to God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>Upon hearing these words Ananias fell down dead, and all who heard the words were awe-struck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>The younger men, however, rose, and wrapping the body up, carried it out and buried it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>About three hours had passed, when his wife came in, knowing nothing of what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>Peter at once questioned her. »Tell me,« he said, »whether you sold the land for so much.«»Yes,« she replied, »for so much.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>»How was it,« replied Peter, »that you two agreed to try an experiment upon the Spirit of the Lord? The men who have buried your husband are already at the door, and they will carry you out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>Instantly she fell down dead at his feet, and the young men came in and found her dead. So they carried her out and buried her by her husband's side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>This incident struck terror into the whole Church, and into the hearts of all who heard of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>Many signs and marvels continued to be done among the people by the Apostles; and by common consent they all met in Solomon's Portico.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>But none of the others dared to attach themselves to them. Yet the people held them in high honour–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>and more and more believers in the Lord joined them, including great numbers both of men and women–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>so that they would even bring out their sick friends into the streets and lay them on light couches or mats, in order that when Peter came by, at least his shadow might fall on one or other of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>The inhabitants, too, of the towns in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem came in crowds, bringing sick persons and some who were harassed by foul spirits, and they were cured, one and all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>This roused the High Priest. He and all his party –the sect of the Sadducees– were filled with angry jealousy</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>and laid hands upon the Apostles, and put them into the public jail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>»Go and stand in the Temple, and go on proclaiming to the people all this Message of Life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>Having received that command they went into the Temple, just before daybreak, and began to teach: So when the High Priest and his party came, and had called together the Sanhedrin as well as all the Elders of the descendants of Israel, they sent to the jail to fetch the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But the officers went and could not find them in the prison. So they came back and brought word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying, »The jail we found quite safely locked, and the warders were on guard at the doors, but upon going in we found no one there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>When the Commander of the Temple Guards and the High Priests heard this statement, they were utterly at a loss with regard to it, wondering what would happen next.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>And some one came and brought them word, saying, »The men you put in prison are actually in the Temple, standing there, teaching the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Upon this the Commander went with the officers, and brought the Apostles; but without using violence; for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>So they brought them and made them stand in front of the Sanhedrin. And then the High Priest questioned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>»We strictly forbad you to teach in that name–did we not?« he said. »And see, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and are trying to make us responsible for that man's death!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>Peter and the other Apostles replied, »We must obey God rather than man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our forefathers has raised Jesus to life, whom you crucified and put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>God has exalted Him to His right hand as Chief Leader and as Saviour, to give Israel repentance and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>And we –and the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him– are witnesses as to these things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>Infuriated at getting this answer, they were disposed to kill the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>But a Pharisee of the name of Gamaliel, a teacher of the Law, held in honour by all the people, rose from his seat and requested that they should be sent outside the court for a few minutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>»Israelites,« he said, »be careful what you are about to do in dealing with these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>Years ago Theudas appeared, professing to be a person of importance, and a body of men, some four hundred in number, joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and annihilated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After him, at the time of the Census, came Judas, the Galilaean, and was the leader in a revolt. He too perished, and all his followers were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now I tell you to hold aloof from these men and leave them alone–for if this scheme or work is of human origin, it will come to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>But if it is really from God, you will be powerless to put them down–lest perhaps you find yourselves to be actually fighting against God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>His advice carried conviction. So they called the Apostles in, and –after flogging them– ordered them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and then let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>They, therefore, left the Sanhedrin and went their way, rejoicing that they had been deemed worthy to suffer disgrace on behalf of the NAME.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>But they did not desist from teaching every day, in the Temple or in private houses, and telling the Good News about Jesus, the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.6'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>About this time, as the number of disciples was increasing, complaints were made by the Greek-speaking Jews against the Hebrews because their widows were habitually overlooked in the daily ministration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>So the Twelve called together the general body of the disciples and said, »It does not seem fitting that we Apostles should neglect the delivery of God's Message and minister at tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>Therefore, brethren, pick out from among yourselves seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, and we will appoint them to undertake this duty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.4'>But, as for us, we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the delivery of the Message.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>The suggestion met with general approval, and they selected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>These men they brought to the Apostles, and, after prayer, they laid their hands upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>Meanwhile God's Message continued to spread, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem very greatly increased, and very many priests obeyed the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>And Stephen, full of grace and power, performed great marvels and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>But some members of the so-called `Synagogue of the Freed-men,' together with some Cyrenaeans, Alexandrians, Cilicians and men from Roman Asia, were roused to encounter Stephen in debate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>They were quite unable, however, to resist the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>Then they privately put forward men who declared, »We have heard him speak blasphemous things against Moses and against God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>In this way they excited the people, the Elders, and the Scribes. At length they came upon him, seized him with violence, and took him before the Sanhedrin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>Here they brought forward false witnesses who declared, »This fellow is incessantly speaking against the Holy Place and the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.14'>For we have heard him say that Jesus, the Nazarene, will pull this place down to the ground and will change the customs which Moses handed down to us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.15'>At once the eyes of all who were sitting in the Sanhedrin were fastened on him, and they saw his face looking just like the face of an angel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.7'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>Then the High Priest asked him, »Are these statements true?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>The reply of Stephen was, »Sirs –brethren and fathers– listen to me. God Most Glorious appeared to our forefather Abraham when he was living in Mesopotamia, before he settled in Haran,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.3'>and said to him, »`Leave your country and your relatives, and go into whatever land I point out to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>»Thereupon he left Chaldaea and settled in Haran till after the death of his father, when God caused him to remove into this country where you now live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>But he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not a single square yard of ground. And yet He promised to bestow the land as a permanent possession on him and his posterity after him–and promised this at a time when Abraham was childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>And God declared that Abraham's posterity should for four hundred years make their home in a country not their own, and be reduced to slavery and be oppressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>»`And the nation, whichever it is, that enslaves them, I will judge,' said God; `and afterwards they shall come out, and they shall worship Me in this place.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>»Then He gave him the Covenant of circumcision, and under this Covenant he became the father of Isaac–whom he circumcised on the eighth day. Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of the twelve Patriarchs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>»The Patriarchs were jealous of Joseph and sold him into slavery in Egypt. But God was with him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>and delivered him from all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him governor over Egypt and all the royal household.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.11'>But there came a famine throughout the whole of Egypt and Canaan –and great distress– so that our forefathers could find no food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.12'>When, however, Jacob heard that there was wheat to be had, he sent our forefathers into Egypt; that was the first time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.13'>On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Pharaoh was informed of Joseph's parentage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.14'>Then Joseph sent and invited his father Jacob and all his family, numbering seventy-five persons, to come to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.15'>and Jacob went down into Egypt. There he died, and so did our forefathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.16'>and they were taken to Shechem and were laid in the tomb which Abraham had bought from the sons of Hamor at Shechem for a sum of money paid in silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.17'>»But as the time drew near for the fulfilment of the promise which God had made to Abraham, the people became many times more numerous in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.18'>until there arose a foreign king over Egypt who knew nothing of Joseph.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.19'>He adopted a crafty policy towards our race, and oppressed our forefathers, making them cast out their infants so that they might not be permitted to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.20'>At this time Moses was born–a wonderfully beautiful child; and for three months he was cared for in his father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.21'>At length he was cast out, but Pharaoh's daughter adopted him, and brought him up as her own son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.22'>So Moses was educated in all the learning of the Egyptians, and possessed great influence through his eloquence and his achievements.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.23'>»And when he was just forty years old, it occurred to him to visit his brethren the descendants of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.24'>Seeing one of them wrongfully treated he took his part, and secured justice for the ill-treated man by striking down the Egyptian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.25'>He supposed his brethren to be aware that by him God was sending them deliverance; this, however, they did not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.26'>The next day, also, he came and found two of them fighting, and he endeavoured to make peace between them. »`Sirs,' he said, `you are brothers. Why are you wronging one another?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.27'>»But the man who was doing the wrong resented his interference, and asked,« `Who appointed you magistrate and judge over us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.28'>Do you mean to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.29'>»Alarmed at this question, Moses fled from the country and went to live in the land of Midian. There he became the father of two sons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.30'>»But at the end of forty years there appeared to him in the Desert of Mount Sinai an angel in the middle of a flame of fire in a bush.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.31'>When Moses saw this he wondered at the sight; but on his going up to look further, the voice of the Lord was heard, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.32'>»`I am the God of your forefathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob.'« Quaking with fear Moses did not dare gaze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.33'>»`Take off your shoes,' said the Lord, `for the spot on which you are standing is holy ground.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.34'>I have seen, yes, I have seen the oppression of My people who are in Egypt and have heard their groans, and I have come down to deliver them. And now I will send you to Egypt.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.35'>»The Moses whom they rejected, asking him, `Who appointed you magistrate and judge?' –that same Moses we find God sending as a magistrate and a deliverer by the help of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.36'>This was he who brought them out, after performing marvels and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea, and in the Desert for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.37'>This is the Moses who said to the descendants of Israel, »`God will raise up a Prophet for you, from among your brethren, just as He raised me up.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.38'>`This is he who was among the Congregation in the Desert, together with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our forefathers, who received ever-living utterances to hand on to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.39'>»Our forefathers, however, would not submit to him, but spurned his authority and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.40'>They said to Aaron, »`Make gods for us, to march in front of us; for as for this Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.41'>»Moreover they made a calf at that time, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and kept rejoicing in the gods which their own hands had made.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.42'>So God turned from them and gave them up to the worship of the Host of Heaven, as it is written in the Book of the Prophets, »'Were they victims and sacrifices which you offered Me, forty years in the Desert, O House of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.43'>Yes, you lifted up Moloch's tent and the Star of the God Rephan–the images which you made in order to worship them; and I will remove you beyond Babylon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.44'>»Our forefathers had the Tent of the Testimony in the Desert, built as He who spoke to Moses had instructed him to make it in imitation of the model which he had seen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.45'>That Tent was bequeathed to the next generation of our forefathers. Under Joshua they brought it with them when they were taking possession of the land of the Gentile nations, whom God drove out before them. So it continued till David's time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.46'>David obtained favour with God, and asked leave to provide a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.47'>But it was Solomon who built a house for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.48'>Yet the Most High does not dwell in buildings erected by men's hands. But, as the Prophet declares,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.49'>»`The sky is My throne, and earth is the footstool for My feet. What kind of house will you build for Me, says the Lord, or what resting place shall I have?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.50'>Did not My hand form this universe.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.51'>»O stiff-necked men, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you also are continually at strife with the Holy Spirit–just as your forefathers were.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.52'>Which of the Prophets did not your forefathers persecute? Yes, they killed those who announced beforehand the advent of the righteous One, whose betrayers and murderers you have now become–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.53'>you who received the Law given through angels, and yet have not obeyed it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.54'>As they listened to these words, they became infuriated and gnashed their teeth at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.55'>But, full of the Holy Spirit and looking up to Heaven, Stephen saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at God's right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.56'>»I can see Heaven wide open,« he said, »and the Son of Man standing at God's right hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.57'>Upon this, with a loud outcry they stopped their ears, rushed upon Stephen in a body,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.58'>dragged him out of the city, and stoned him, the witnesses throwing off their outer garments and giving them into the care of a young man called Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.59'>So they stoned Stephen, while he prayed, »Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.60'>Then, rising on his knees, he cried aloud, »Lord, do not reckon this sin against them.« And with these words he fell asleep.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.8'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.1'>And Saul fully approved of his murder. At this time a great persecution broke out against the Church in Jerusalem, and all except the Apostles were scattered throughout Judaea and Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.2'>A party of devout men, however, buried Stephen, and made loud lamentation over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.3'>But Saul cruelly harassed the Church. He went into house after house, and, dragging off both men and women, threw them into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.4'>Those, however, who were scattered abroad went from place to place spreading the Good News of God's Message;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.5'>while Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed Christ there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.6'>Crowds of people, with one accord, gave attention to what they heard from him, listening, and witnessing the signs which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.7'>For, with a loud cry, foul spirits came out of many possessed by them, and many paralytics and lame persons were restored to health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.8'>And there was great joy in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.9'>Now for some time past there had been a man named Simon living there, who had been practising magic and astonishing the Samaritans, pretending that he was more than human.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.10'>To him people of all classes paid attention, declaring, »This man is the Power of God, known as the great Power.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.11'>His influence over them arose from their having been, for a long time, bewildered by his sorceries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.12'>But when Philip began to tell the Good News about the Kingdom of God and about the Name of Jesus Christ, and they embraced the faith, they were baptized, men and women alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.13'>Simon himself also believed, and after being baptized remained in close attendance on Philip, and was full of amazement at seeing such signs and such great miracles performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.14'>When the Apostles in Jerusalem heard that the Samaritans had accepted God's Message, they sent Peter and John to visit them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.15'>They, when they came down, prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.16'>for He had not as yet fallen upon any of them. They had only been baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.17'>Then the Apostles placed their hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.18'>When, however, Simon saw that it was through the laying on of the Apostles' hands that the Spirit was bestowed, he offered them money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.19'>»Give me too,« he said, »that power, so that every one on whom I place my hands will receive the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.20'>»Perish your money and yourself,« replied Peter, »because you have imagined that you can obtain God's free gift with money!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.21'>No part or lot have you in this matter, for your heart is not right in God's sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.22'>Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord, in the hope that the purpose which is in your heart may perhaps be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.23'>For I perceive that you have fallen into the bitterest bondage of unrighteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.24'>»Pray, both of you, to the Lord for me,« answered Simon, »that nothing of what you have said may come upon me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.25'>So the Apostles, after giving a solemn charge and delivering the Lord's Message, travelled back to Jerusalem, making known the Good News also in many of the Samaritan villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.26'>And an angel of the Lord said to Philip, »Rise and proceed south to the road that runs down from Jerusalem to Gaza, crossing the Desert.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.27'>Upon this he rose and went. Now, as it happened, an Ethiopian eunuch who was in a position of high authority with Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, as her treasurer, had visited Jerusalem to worship there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.28'>and was now on his way home; and as he sat in his chariot he was reading the Prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.29'>Then the Spirit said to Philip, »Go and enter that chariot.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.30'>So Philip ran up and heard the eunuch reading the Prophet Isaiah. »Do you understand what you are reading?« he asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.31'>»Why, how can I,« replied the eunuch, »unless some one explains it to me?« And he earnestly invited Philip to come up and sit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.32'>The passage of Scripture which he was reading was this: »Like a sheep He was led to slaughter, and just as a lamb before its shearer is dumb so He opened not His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.33'>In His humiliation justice was denied Him. Who will make known His posterity? For He is destroyed from among men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.34'>»Pray, of whom is the Prophet speaking?« inquired the eunuch; »of himself or of some one else?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>Then Philip began to speak, and, commencing with that same portion of Scripture, told him the Good News about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>So they proceeded on their way till they came to some water; and the eunuch exclaimed, »See, here is water; what is there to prevent my being baptized?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.37'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>So he stopped the chariot; and both of them –Philip and the eunuch– went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>But no sooner had they come up out of the water than the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away, and the eunuch did not see him again. With a glad heart he resumed his journey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>but Philip found himself at Ashdod. Then visiting town after town he everywhere made known the Good News until he reached Caesarea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.9'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>Now Saul, whose every breath was a threat of destruction for the disciples of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>went to the High Priest and begged from him letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus, in order that if he found any believers there, either men or women, he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>But on the journey, as he was getting near Damascus, suddenly there flashed round him a light from Heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>and falling to the ground he heard a voice which said to him, »Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>»Who art thou, Lord?« he asked. »I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting,« was the reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>»But rise and go to the city, and you will be told what you are to do.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>Meanwhile the men who travelled with Saul were standing dumb with amazement, hearing a sound, but seeing no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>Then he rose from the ground, but when he had opened his eyes, he could not see, and they led him by the arm and brought him to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>And for two days he remained without sight, and did not eat or drink anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>Now in Damascus there was a disciple of the name of Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, saying, »Ananias!«»I am here, Lord,« he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>»Rise,« said the Lord, »and go to Straight Street, and inquire at the house of Judas for a man called Saul, from Tarsus, for he is actually praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>He has seen a man called Ananias come and lay his hands upon him so that he may recover his sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>»Lord,« answered Ananias, »I have heard about that man from many, and I have heard of the great mischief he has done to Thy people in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>and here he is authorized by the High Priests to arrest all who call upon Thy name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>»Go,« replied the Lord; »he is a chosen instrument of Mine to carry My name to the Gentiles and to kings and to the descendants of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I will let him know the great sufferings which he must pass through for My sake.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>So Ananias went and entered the house; and, laying his two hands upon Saul, said, »Saul, brother, the Lord –even Jesus who appeared to you on your journey– has sent me, that you may recover your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>Instantly there dropped from his eyes what seemed to be scales, and he could see once more. Upon this he rose and received baptism;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>after which he took food and regained his strength. Then he remained some little time with the disciples in Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And in the synagogues he began at once to proclaim Jesus as the Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>and his hearers were all amazed, and began to ask one another, »Is not this the man who in Jerusalem tried to exterminate those who called upon that Name, and came here on purpose to carry them off in chains to the High Priests?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>Saul, however, gained more and more influence, and as for the Jews living in Damascus, he bewildered them with his proofs that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>At length the Jews plotted to kill Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>but information of their intention was given to him. They even watched the gates, day and night, in order to murder him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>but his disciples took him by night and let him down through the wall, lowering him in a hamper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>So he came to Jerusalem and made several attempts to associate with the disciples, but they were all afraid of him, being in doubt as to whether he himself was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>Barnabas, however, came to his assistance. He brought Saul to the Apostles, and related to them how, on his journey, he had seen the Lord, and that the Lord had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had fearlessly taught in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>Henceforth Saul was one of them, going in and out of the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>and speaking fearlessly in the name of the Lord. And he often talked with the Hellenists and had discussions with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>But they kept trying to take his life. On learning this, the brethren brought him down to Caesarea, and then sent him by sea to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>The Church, however, throughout the whole of Judaea, Galilee and Samaria, had peace and was spiritually built up; and grew in numbers, living in the fear of the Lord and receiving encouragement from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>Now Peter, as he went to town after town, came down also to God's people at Lud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>There he found a man of the name of Aeneas, who for eight years had kept his bed, through being paralysed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>Peter said to him, »Aeneas, Jesus Christ cures you. Rise and make your own bed.« He at once rose to his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>And all the people of Lud and Sharon saw him; and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>Among the disciples at Jaffa was a woman called Tabitha, or, as the name may be translated, `Dorcas.' Her life was wholly devoted to the good and charitable actions which she was constantly doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>But, as it happened, just at that time she was taken ill and died. After washing her body they laid it out in a room upstairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>Lud, however, being near Jaffa, the disciples, who had heard that Peter was at Lud, sent two men to him with an urgent request that he would come across to them without delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>So Peter rose and went with them. On his arrival they took him upstairs, and the widow women all came and stood by his side, weeping and showing him the underclothing and cloaks and garments of all kinds which Dorcas used to make while she was still with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>Peter, however, putting every one out of the room, knelt down and prayed, and then turning to the body, he said, »Tabitha, rise.« Dorcas at once opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>Then, giving her his hand, he raised her to her feet and, calling to him God's people and the widows, he gave her back to them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>This incident became known throughout Jaffa, and many believed in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>and Peter remained for a considerable time at Jaffa, staying at the house of a man called Simon, a tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>Now a Captain of the Italian Regiment, named Cornelius, was quartered at Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>He was religious and God-fearing–and so was every member of his household. He was also liberal in his charities to the people, and continually offered prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About three o'clock one afternoon he had a vision, and distinctly saw an angel of God enter his house, who called him by name, saying, »Cornelius!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>Looking steadily at him, and being much alarmed, he said, »What do you want, Sir?«»Your prayers and charities,« he replied, »have gone up and have been recorded before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send to Jaffa and fetch Simon, surnamed Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He is staying as a guest with Simon, a tanner, who has a house close to the sea.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>So when the angel who had been speaking to him was gone, Cornelius called two of his servants and a God-fearing soldier who was in constant attendance on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and, after telling them everything, he sent them to Jaffa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>The next day, while they were still on their journey and were getting near the town, about noon Peter went up on the house-top to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>He had become unusually hungry and wished for food; but, while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>The sky had opened to his view, and what seemed to be an enormous sail was descending, being let down to the earth by ropes at the four corners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>In it were all kinds of quadrupeds, reptiles and birds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>and a voice came to him which said, »Rise, Peter, kill and eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>»On no account, Lord,« he replied; »for I have never yet eaten anything unholy and impure.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>Again a second time a voice was heard which said, »What God has purified, you must not regard as unholy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This was said three times, and immediately the sail was drawn up out of sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>While Peter was greatly perplexed as to the meaning of the vision which he had seen, just then the men sent by Cornelius, having by inquiry found out Simon's house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>had come to the door and had called the servant, and were asking, »Is Simon, surnamed Peter, staying here?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>And Peter was still earnestly thinking over the vision, when the Spirit said to him, »Three men are now inquiring for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Rise, go down, and go with them without any misgivings; for it is I who have sent them to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>So Peter went down and said to the men, »I am the Simon you are inquiring for. What is the reason of your coming?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>Their reply was, »Cornelius, a Captain, an upright and God-fearing man, of whom the whole Jewish nation speaks well, has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and listen to what you have to say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Upon hearing this, Peter invited them in, and gave them a lodging. The next day he set out with them, some of the brethren from Jaffa going with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>and the day after that they reached Caesarea. There Cornelius was awaiting their arrival, and had invited all his relatives and intimate friends to be present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>When Peter entered the house, Cornelius met him, and threw himself at his feet to do him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter lifted him up. »Stand up,« he said; »I myself also am but a man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>So Peter went in and conversed with him, and found a large company assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>He said to them, »You know better than most that a Jew is strictly forbidden to associate with a Gentile or visit him; but God has taught me to call no one unholy or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>So for this reason, when sent for, I came without raising any objection. I therefore ask why you sent for me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>»Just at this hour, three days ago,« replied Cornelius, »I was offering afternoon prayer in my house, when suddenly a man in shining raiment stood in front of me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>who said, »`Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your charities have been put on record before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send therefore to Jaffa, and invite Simon, surnamed Peter, to come here. He is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, close to the sea.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>»Immediately, therefore, I sent to you, and I thank you heartily for having come. That is why all of us are now assembled here in God's presence, to listen to what the Lord has commanded you to say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter began to speak. »I clearly see,« he said, »that God makes no distinctions between one man and another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but that in every nation those who fear Him and live good lives are acceptable to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>The Message which He sent to the descendants of Israel, when He announced the Good News of peace through Jesus Christ –He is Lord of all– that Message you cannot but know;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>the story, I mean, which has spread through the length and breadth of Judaea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>It tells how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, so that He went about everywhere doing acts of kindness, and curing all who were being continually oppressed by the Devil–for God was with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>»And we are witnesses as to all that He did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. But they even put Him to death, by crucifixion.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>That same Jesus God raised to life on the third day, and permitted Him to appear unmistakably,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to witnesses –men previously chosen by God– namely, to us, who ate and drank with Him after He rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And He has commanded us to preach to the people and solemnly declare that this is He who has been appointed by God to be the Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To Him all the Prophets bear witness, and testify that through His name all who believe in Him receive the forgiveness of their sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all who were listening to the Message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And all the Jewish believers who had come with Peter were astonished that on the Gentiles also the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking in tongues and extolling the majesty of God. Then Peter said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>»Can any one forbid the use of water, and object to these persons being baptized–men who have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he directed that they should be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they begged him to remain with them for a time.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the Apostles, and the brethren in various parts of Judaea, heard that the Gentiles also had received God's Message;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>and, when Peter returned to Jerusalem, the champions of circumcision found fault with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>»You went into the houses of men who are not Jews,« they said, »and you ate with them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>Peter, however, explained the whole matter to them from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>»While I was in the town of Jaffa, offering prayer,« he said, »in a trance I saw a vision. There descended what seemed to be an enormous sail, being let down from the sky by ropes at the four corners, and it came close to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>Fixing my eyes on it, I examined it closely, and saw various kinds of quadrupeds, wild beasts, reptiles and birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>I also heard a voice saying to me, »`Rise, Peter, kill and eat.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>»`On no account, Lord,' I replied, `for nothing unholy or impure has ever gone into my mouth.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>»But a voice answered, speaking a second time from the sky,« `What God has purified, you must not regard as unholy.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>»This was said three times, and then everything was drawn up again out of sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>»Now at that very moment three men came to the house where we were, having been sent from Caesarea to find me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit told me to accompany them without any misgivings. There also went with me these six brethren who are now present, and we reached the Centurion's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>Then he described to us how he had seen the angel come and enter his house and say, »`Send to Jaffa and fetch Simon, surnamed Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>He will teach you truths by which you and all your family will be saved.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>»And,« said Peter, »no sooner had I begun to speak than the Holy Spirit fell upon them, just as He fell upon us at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>Then I remembered the Lord's words, how He used to say, »`John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>»If therefore God gave them the same gift as He gave us when we first believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, why, who was I to be able to thwart God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>This statement of Peter's silenced his opponents. They extolled the goodness of God, and said, »So, then, to the Gentiles also God has given the repentance which leads to Life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Those, however, who had been driven in various directions by the persecution which broke out on account of Stephen made their way to Phoenicia, Cyprus and Antioch, delivering the Message to none but Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>But some of them were Cyprians and Cyrenaeans, who, on coming to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks also and told them the Good News concerning the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>The power of the Lord was with them, and there were a vast number who believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>When tidings of this reached the ears of the Church in Jerusalem, they sent Barnabas as far as Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>On getting there he was delighted to see the grace which God had bestowed; and he encouraged them all to remain, with fixed resolve, faithful to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man, and was full of the Holy Spirit and of faith; and the number of believers in the Lord greatly increased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then Barnabas paid a visit to Tarsus to try to find Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>He succeeded, and brought him to Antioch; and for a whole year they attended the meetings of the Church, and taught a large number of people. And it was in Antioch that the disciples first received the name of `Christians.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>At that time certain Prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>one of whom, named Agabus, being instructed by the Spirit, publicly predicted the speedy coming of a great famine throughout the world. (It came in the reign of Claudius.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>So the disciples decided to send relief, every one in proportion to his means, to the brethren living in Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>This they did, forwarding their contributions to the Elders by Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>Now, about that time, King Herod arrested certain members of the Church, in order to ill-treat them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>and James, John's brother, he beheaded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>Finding that this gratified the Jews, he proceeded to seize Peter also; these being the days of Unleavened Bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>He had him arrested and lodged in jail, handing him over to the care of sixteen soldiers; and intended after the Passover to bring him out again to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>So Peter was kept in prison; but long and fervent prayer was offered to God by the Church on his behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>Now when Herod was on the point of taking him out of prison, that very night Peter was asleep between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and guards were on duty outside the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>Suddenly an angel of the Lord stood by him, and a light shone in the cell; and, striking Peter on the side, he woke him and said, »Rise quickly.« Instantly the chains dropped off his wrists.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>»Fasten your girdle,« said the angel, »and tie on your sandals.« He did so. Then the angel said, »Throw your cloak round you, and follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>So Peter went out, following him, yet could not believe that what the angel was doing was real, but supposed that he saw a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And passing through the first ward and the second, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. This opened to them of itself; and, going out, they passed on through one of the streets, and then suddenly the angel left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>Peter coming to himself said, »Now I know for certain that the Lord has sent His angel and has rescued me from the power of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were anticipating.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>So, after thinking things over, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John surnamed Mark, where a large number of people were assembled, praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>When he knocked at the wicket in the door, a maidservant named Rhoda came to answer the knock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>and recognizing Peter's voice, for very joy she did not open the door, but ran in and told them that Peter was standing there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>»You are mad,« they said. But she strenuously maintained that it was true. »It is his guardian angel,« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>Meanwhile Peter went on knocking, until at last they opened the door and saw that it was really he, and were filled with amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>But he motioned with his hand for silence, and then described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. »Tell all this to James and the brethren,« he added. Then he left them, and went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers, as to what could possibly have become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And when Herod had had him searched for and could not find him, after sharply questioning the guards he ordered them away to execution. He then went down from Judaea to Caesarea and remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now the people of Tyre and Sidon had incurred Herod's violent displeasure. So they sent a large deputation to wait on him; and having secured the good will of Blastus, his treasurer, they begged the king to be friendly with them again, because their country was dependent on his for its food supply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>So, on an appointed day, Herod, having arrayed himself in royal robes, took his seat on the tribunal, and was haranguing them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>and the assembled people kept shouting, »It is the voice of a god, and not of a man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>Instantly an angel of the Lord struck him, because he had not given the glory to God, and being eaten up by worms, he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But God's Message prospered, and converts were multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having discharged their mission, and they brought with them John, surnamed Mark.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now there were in Antioch, in the Church there –as Prophets and teachers– barnabas, Symeon surnamed `the black,' Lucius the Cyrenaean, Manaen (who was Herod the Tetrarch's foster-brother), and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>While they were worshipping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, »Set apart for Me, now at once, Barnabas and Saul, for the work to which I have called them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>So, after fasting and prayer and the laying on of hands, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>They therefore, being thus sent out by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleuceia, and from there sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>Having reached Salamis, they began to announce God's Message in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John as their assistant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>When they had gone through the whole length of the island as far as Paphos, they there met with a Jewish magician and false prophet, Bar-Jesus by name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was a friend of the Proconsul Sergius Paulus. The Proconsul was a man of keen intelligence. He sent for Barnabas and Saul, and asked to be told God's Message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas (or `the Magician,' for such is the meaning of the name) opposed them, and tried to prevent the Proconsul from accepting the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>Then Saul, who is also called Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and, fixing his eyes on Elymas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>said, »You who are full of every kind of craftiness and unscrupulous cunning –you son of the Devil and foe to all that is right– will you never cease to misrepresent the straight paths of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>The Lord's hand is now upon you, and you will be blind for a time and unable to see the light of day.« Instantly there fell upon him a mist and a darkness, and, as he walked about, he begged people to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then the Proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed, being struck with amazement at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>From Paphos, Paul and his party put out to sea and sailed to Perga in Pamphylia. John, however, left them and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>But they themselves, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch in Pisidia. Here, on the Sabbath day, they went into the synagogue and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the Wardens of the synagogue sent word to them. »Brethren,« they said, »if you have anything encouraging to say to the people, speak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>So Paul rose, and motioning with his hand for silence, said, »Israelites, and you others who fear God, pay attention to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people of Israel chose our forefathers, and made the people great during their stay in Egypt, until with wondrous power He brought them out from that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>For a period of about forty years, He fed them, like a nurse, in the Desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>Then, after overthrowing seven nations in the land of Canaan, He divided that country among them as their inheritance for about four hundred and fifty years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>and afterwards He gave them judges down to the time of the Prophet Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>Next they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a Benjamite, who reigned forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>After removing him, He raised up David to be their king, to whom He also bore witness when He said, »`I have found David the son of Jesse, a man I love, who will obey all My commands.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>»It is from among David's descendants that God, in fulfilment of His promise, has raised up a Saviour for Israel, even Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>Before the coming of Jesus, John had proclaimed to all the people of Israel a baptism of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>But John, towards the end of his career, repeatedly asked the people, »`What do you suppose me to be? I am not the Christ. But there is One coming after me whose sandal I am not worthy to unfasten.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>»Brethren, descendants of the family of Abraham, and all among you who fear God, to us has this Message of salvation been sent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>For the people of Jerusalem and their rulers, by the judgement they pronounced on Jesus, have actually fulfilled the predictions of the Prophets which are read Sabbath after Sabbath, through ignorance of those predictions and of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>Without having found Him guilty of any capital offence they urged Pilate to have Him put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>and when they had carried out everything which had been written about Him, they took Him down from the cross and laid Him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>»But God raised Him from the dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>And, after a few days, He appeared to the people who had gone up with Him from Galilee to Jerusalem and are now witnesses concerning Him to the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>And we bring you the Good News about the promise made to our forefathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>that God has amply fulfilled it to our children in raising up Jesus; as it is also written in the second Psalm, `Thou art My Son: to-day I have become Thy Father.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>And as to His having raised Him from among the dead, never again to be in the position of one soon to return to decay, He speaks thus: `I will give you the holy and trustworthy promises made to David.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>Because in another Psalm also He says, `Thou wilt not give up Thy Holy One to undergo decay.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>For David, after having been useful to his own generation in accordance with God's purpose, did fall asleep, was gathered to his forefathers, and did undergo decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>But He whom God raised to life underwent no decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>»Understand therefore, brethren, that through this Jesus forgiveness of sins is announced to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>and in Him every believer is absolved from all offences, from which you could not be absolved under the Law of Moses.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>Beware, then, lest what is spoken in the Prophets should come true of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>`Behold, you despisers, be astonished and perish, because I am carrying on a work in your time–a work which you will utterly refuse to believe, though it be fully declared to you.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>As Paul and Barnabas were leaving the synagogue, the people earnestly begged to have all this repeated to them on the following Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>And, when the congregation had broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout converts from heathenism continued with Paul and Barnabas, who talked to them and urged them to hold fast to the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>On the next Sabbath almost the whole population of the city came together to hear the Lord's Message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>Seeing the crowds, the Jews, filled with angry jealousy, opposed Paul's statements and abused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>Then, throwing off all reserve, Paul and Barnabas said, »We were bound to proclaim God's Message to you first. But since you spurn it and judge yourselves to be unworthy of the Life of the Ages–well, we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For such is the Lord's command to us. »`I have placed Thee,' He says of Christ, `as a light to the Gentiles, in order that Thou mayest be a Saviour as far as the remotest parts of the earth.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>The Gentiles listened with delight and extolled the Lord's Message; and all who were pre-destined to the Life of the Ages believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>So the Lord's Message spread through the whole district.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews influenced the gentlewomen of rank who worshipped with them, and also the leading men in the city, and stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas and drove them out of the district.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>But they shook off the dust from their feet as a protest against them and came to Iconium;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>and as for the disciples, they were more and more filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>At Iconium the Apostles went together to the Jewish synagogue and preached, with the result that a great number both of Jews and Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the Jews who had refused obedience stirred up the Gentiles and embittered their minds against the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Yet Paul and Barnabas remained there for a considerable time, speaking freely and relying on the Lord, while He bore witness to the Message of His grace by permitting signs and marvels to be done by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>At length the people of the city split into parties, some siding with the Jews and some with the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>And when a hostile movement was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with the sanction of their magistrates, to maltreat and stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>the Apostles, having become aware of it, made their escape into the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe, and the neighbouring country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>And there they continued to tell the Good News.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>Now a man who had no power in his feet used to sit in the streets of Lystra. He had been lame from his birth and had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>After this man had listened to one of Paul's sermons, the Apostle, looking steadily at him and perceiving that he had faith to be cured,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said in a loud voice, »Stand upright upon your feet!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>So he sprang up and began to walk about. Then the crowds, seeing what Paul had done, rent the air with their shouts in the Lycaonian language, saying, »The gods have assumed human form and have come down to us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>They called Barnabas `Zeus,' and Paul, as being the principal speaker, `Hermes.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>And the priest of Zeus –the temple of Zeus being at the entrance to the city– brought bullocks and garlands to the gates, and in company with the crowd was intending to offer sacrifices to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But the Apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard of it; and tearing their clothes they rushed out into the middle of the crowd, exclaiming, »Sirs, why are you doing all this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>We also are but men, with natures kindred to your own; and we bring you the Good News that you are to turn from these unreal things, to worship the ever-living God, the Creator of earth and sky and sea and of everything that is in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>In times gone by He allowed all the nations to go their own ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>and yet by His beneficence He has not left His existence unattested–His beneficence, I mean, in sending you rain from Heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and joyfulness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>Even with words like these they had difficulty in preventing the thronging crowd from offering sacrifices to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>But now a party of Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and, having won over the crowd, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, believing him to be dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>When, however, the disciples had collected round him, he rose and went back into the town. The next day he went with Barnabas to Derbe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>and, after proclaiming the Good News to the people there and gaining a large number of converts, they retraced their steps to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>Everywhere they strengthened the disciples by encouraging them to hold fast to the faith, and warned them saying, »It is through many afflictions that we must make our way into the Kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>And in every Church, after prayer and fasting, they selected Elders by show of hands, and commended them to the Lord on whom their faith rested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>Then passing through Pisidia they came into Pamphylia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>and after telling the Message at Perga they came down to Attaleia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>Thence they sailed to Antioch, where they had previously been commended to the grace of God in connexion with the work which they had now completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>Upon their arrival they called the Church together and proceeded to report in detail all that God, working with them, had done, and how He had opened for the Gentiles the door of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>And they remained a considerable time in Antioch with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>But certain persons who had come down from Judaea tried to convince the brethren, saying, »Unless you are circumcised in accordance with the Mosaic custom, you cannot be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Between these new comers and Paul and Barnabas there was no little disagreement and controversy, until at last it was decided that Paul and Barnabas and some other brethren should go up to consult the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem on this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>So they set out, being accompanied for a short distance by some other members of the Church; and as they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, they told the whole story of the conversion of the Gentiles and inspired all the brethren with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>Upon their arrival in Jerusalem they were cordially received by the Church, the Apostles, and the Elders; and they reported in detail all that God, working with them, had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But certain men who had belonged to the sect of the Pharisees but were now believers, stood up in the assembly, and said, »Yes, Gentile believers ought to be circumcised and be ordered to keep the Law of Moses.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>Then the Apostles and Elders met to consider the matter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>and after there had been a long discussion Peter rose to his feet. »It is within your own knowledge,« he said, »that God originally made choice among you that from my lips the Gentiles were to hear the Message of the Good News, and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>And God, who knows all hearts, gave His testimony in their favour by bestowing the Holy Spirit on them just as He did on us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>and He made no difference between us and them, in that He cleansed their hearts by their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>Now, therefore, why try an experiment upon God, by laying on the necks of these disciples a yoke which neither our forefathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>On the contrary, we believe that it is by the grace of the Lord Jesus that we, as well as they, shall be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>Then the whole assembly remained silent while they listened to the statement made by Paul and Barnabas as to all the signs and marvels that God had done among the Gentiles through their instrumentality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>When they had finished speaking, James said, »Brethren, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Symeon has related how God first looked graciously on the Gentiles to take from among them a People to be called by His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And this is in harmony with the language of the Prophets, which says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>`»Afterwards I will return, and will rebuild David's fallen tent. Its ruins I will rebuild, and I will set it up again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>In order that the rest of mankind may earnestly seek the Lord–even all the nations which are called by My name,«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>Says the Lord, who has been making these things known from ages long past.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>»My judgement, therefore, is against inflicting unexpected annoyance on those of the Gentiles who are turning to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>Yet let us send them written instructions to abstain from things polluted by connexion with idolatry, from fornication, from meat killed by strangling, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>For Moses from the earliest times has had his preachers in every town, being read, as he is, Sabbath after Sabbath, in the various synagogues.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Thereupon it was decided by the Apostles and Elders, with the approval of the whole Church, to choose suitable persons from among themselves and send them to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas. Judas, called Bar-sabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren, were selected,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>and they took with them the following letter: »The Apostles and the elder brethren send greeting to the Gentile brethren throughout Antioch, Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>As we have been informed that certain persons who have gone out from among us have disturbed you by their teaching and have unsettled your minds, without having received any such instructions from us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>we have unanimously decided to select certain men and send them to you in company with our dear friends Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>who have endangered their very lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who are themselves bringing you the same message by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no burden heavier than these necessary requirements–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>You must abstain from things sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication. Keep yourselves clear of these things, and it will be well with you. Farewell.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>They, therefore, having been solemnly sent, came down to Antioch, where they called together the whole assembly and delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>The people read it, and were delighted with the comfort it brought them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>And Judas and Silas, being themselves also Prophets, gave them a long and encouraging talk, and strengthened them in the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>After spending some time there they received an affectionate farewell from the brethren to return to those who had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and, in company with many others, telling the Good News of the Lord's Message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>After a while Paul said to Barnabas, »Suppose we now revisit the brethren in the various towns in which we have made known the Lord's Message–to see whether they are prospering!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>Barnabas, however, was bent on taking with them John, whose other name was Mark,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>while Paul deemed it undesirable to have as their companion one who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone on with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>So there arose a serious disagreement between them, which resulted in their parting from one another, Barnabas taking Mark and setting sail for Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>But Paul chose Silas as his travelling companion; and set out, after being commended by the brethren to the grace of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>and he passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the Churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>He also came to Derbe and to Lystra. At Lystra he found a disciple, Timothy by name–the son of a Christian Jewess, though he had a Greek father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>Timothy was well spoken of by the brethren at Lystra and Iconium,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>and Paul desiring that he should accompany him on his journey, took him and circumcised him on account of the Jews in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>As they journeyed on from town to town, they handed to the brethren for their observance the decisions which had been arrived at by the Apostles and Elders in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>So the Churches went on gaining a stronger faith and growing in numbers from day to day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>Then Paul and his companions passed through Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to proclaim the Message in the province of Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>When they reached the frontier of Mysia, they were about to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus would not permit this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>So, passing along Mysia, they came to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>Here, one night, Paul saw a vision. There was a Macedonian who was standing, entreating him and saying, »Come over into Macedonia and help us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>So when he had seen the vision, we immediately looked out for an opportunity of passing on into Macedonia, confidently inferring that God had called us to proclaim the Good News to the people there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Accordingly we put out to sea from Troas, and ran a straight course to Samothrace. The next day we came to Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and thence to Philippi, which is a city in Macedonia, the first in its district, a Roman colony. And there we stayed some little time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>On the Sabbath we went beyond the city gate to the riverside, where we had reason to believe that there was a place for prayer; and sitting down we talked with the women who had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>Among our hearers was one named Lydia, a dealer in purple goods. She belonged to the city of Thyateira, and was a worshipper of the true God. The Lord opened her heart, so that she gave attention to what Paul was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>When she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, »If in your judgement I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my house.« And she made us go there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>One day, as we were on our way to the place of prayer, a slave girl met us who claimed to be inspired and was accustomed to bring her owners large profits by telling fortunes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>She kept following close behind Paul and the rest of us, crying aloud, »These men are the bondservants of the Most High God, and are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>This she persisted in for a considerable time, until Paul, wearied out, turned round and said to the spirit, »I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her.« And it came out immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>But when her owners saw that their hopes of gain were gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them off to the magistrates in the public square.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>Then they brought them before the praetors. »These men,« they said, »are creating a great disturbance in our city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>They are Jews, and are teaching customs which we, as Romans, are not permitted to adopt or practise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>The crowd, too, joined in the outcry against them, till at length the praetors ordered them to be stripped and beaten with rods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>and, after severely flogging them, they threw them into jail and bade the jailer keep them safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>He, having received an order like that, lodged them in the inner prison, and secured their feet in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>when suddenly there was such a violent shock of earthquake that the prison shook to its foundations. Instantly the doors all flew open, and the chains fell off from every prisoner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>Starting up from sleep and seeing the doors of the jail wide open, the jailer drew his sword and was on the point of killing himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul shouted loudly to him, saying, »Do yourself no injury: we are all here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>Then, calling for lights, he sprang in and fell trembling at the feet of Paul and Silas;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and, bringing them out of the prison, he exclaimed, »O sirs, what must I do to be saved?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>»Believe on the Lord Jesus,« they replied, »and both you and your household will be saved.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they told the Lord's Message to him as well as to all who were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>Then he took them, even at that time of night, washed their wounds, and he and all his household were immediately baptized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>and bringing the Apostles up into his house, he spread a meal for them, and was filled with gladness, with his whole household, his faith resting on God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>In the morning the praetors sent their lictors with the order, »Release those men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>So the jailer brought Paul word, saying, »The praetors have sent orders for you to be released. Now therefore you can go, and proceed on your way in peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, »After cruelly beating us in public, without trial, Roman citizens though we are, they have thrown us into prison, and are they now going to send us away privately? No, indeed! Let them come in person and fetch us out.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>This answer the lictors took back to the praetors, who were alarmed when they were told that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>Accordingly they came and apologized to them; and, bringing them out, asked them to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>Then Paul and Silas, having come out of the prison, went to Lydia's house; and, after seeing the brethren and encouraging them, they left Philippi.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Then, passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they went to Thessalonica. Here there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>Paul –following his usual custom– betook himself to it, and for three successive Sabbaths reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>which he clearly explained, pointing out that it had been necessary for the Christ to suffer and rise again from the dead, and insisting, »The Jesus whom I am announcing to you is the Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>Some of the people were won over, and attached themselves to Paul and Silas, including many God-fearing Greeks and not a few gentlewomen of high rank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the jealousy of the Jews was aroused, and, calling to their aid some ill-conditioned and idle fellows, they got together a riotous mob and filled the city with uproar. They then attacked the house of Jason and searched for Paul and Silas, to bring them out before the assembly of people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>But, failing to find them, they dragged Jason and some of the other brethren before the magistrates of the city, loudly accusing them. »These men,« they said, »who have raised a tumult throughout the Empire, have come here also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>Jason has received them into his house; and they all set Caesar's authority at defiance, declaring that there is another Emperor– one called Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>Great was the excitement among the crowd, and among the magistrates of the city, when they heard these charges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>They required Jason and the rest to find substantial bail, and after that they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>The brethren at once sent Paul and Silas away by night to Beroea, and they, on their arrival, went to the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>The Jews at Beroea were of a nobler disposition than those in Thessalonica, for they very readily received the Message, and day after day searched the Scriptures to see whether it was as Paul stated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>As the result many of them became believers, and so did not a few of the Greeks–gentlewomen of good position, and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>As soon, however, as the Jews of Thessalonica learnt that God's Message had been proclaimed by Paul at Beroea, they came there also, and incited the mob to a riot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>Then the brethren promptly sent Paul down to the sea-coast, but Silas and Timothy remained behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>Those who were caring for Paul's safety went with him as far as Athens, and then left him, taking a message from him to Silas and Timothy, asking them to join him as speedily as possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred within him when he noticed that the city was full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>So he had discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and the other worshippers, and in the market place, day after day, with those whom he happened to meet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>A few of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also encountered him. Some of them asked, »What has this beggarly babbler to say?«»His business,« said others, »seems to be to cry up some foreign gods.« This was because he had been telling the Good News of Jesus and the Resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>Then they took him and brought him up to the Areopagus, asking him, »May we be told what this new teaching of yours is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For the things you are saying sound strange to us. We should therefore like to be told exactly what they mean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>(For all the Athenians and their foreign visitors used to devote their whole leisure to telling or hearing about something new.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>So Paul, taking his stand in the centre of the Areopagus, spoke as follows: »Men of Athens, I perceive that you are in every respect remarkably religious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For as I passed along and observed the things you worship, I found also an altar bearing the inscription, `TO AN UNKNOWN GOD.' »The Being, therefore, whom you, without knowing Him, revere, Him I now proclaim to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>GOD who made the universe and everything in it–He, being Lord of Heaven and earth, does not dwell in sanctuaries built by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>Nor is He ministered to by human hands, as though He needed anything–but He Himself gives to all men life and breath and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>He caused to spring from one forefather people of every race, for them to live on the whole surface of the earth, and marked out for them an appointed span of life and the boundaries of their homes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they might seek God, if perhaps they could grope for Him and find Him. Yes, though He is not far from any one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For it is in closest union with Him that we live and move and have our being; as in fact some of the poets in repute among yourselves have said, `For we are also His offspring.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Since then we are God's offspring, we ought not to imagine that His nature resembles gold or silver or marble, or anything sculptured by the art and inventive faculty of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>Those times of ignorance God viewed with indulgence. But now He commands all men everywhere to repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>seeing that He has appointed a day on which, before long, He will judge the world in righteousness, through the instrumentality of a man whom He has pre-destined to this work, and has made the fact certain to every one by raising Him from the dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>When they heard Paul speak of a resurrection of dead men, some began to scoff. But others said, »We will hear you again on that subject.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>So Paul went away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>A few, however, attached themselves to him and believed, among them being Dionysius a member of the Council, a gentlewoman named Damaris, and some others.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After this he left Athens and came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>Here he found a Jew, a native of Pontus, of the name of Aquila. He and his wife Priscilla had recently come from Italy because of Claudius's edict expelling all the Jews from Rome. So Paul paid them a visit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>and because he was of the same trade –that of tent-maker– he lodged with them and worked with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>But, Sabbath after Sabbath, he preached in the synagogue and tried to win over both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>Now at the time when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was preaching fervently and was solemnly telling the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But upon their opposing him with abusive language, he shook his clothes by way of protest, and said to them, »Your ruin will be upon your own heads. I am not responsible: in future I will go among the Gentiles.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>So he left the place and went to the house of a person called Titius Justus, a worshipper of the true God. His house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the Warden of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, and so did all his household; and from time to time many of the Corinthians who heard Paul believed and received baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And, in a vision by night, the Lord said to Paul, »Dismiss your fears: go on speaking, and do not give up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>I am with you, and no one shall attack you to injure you; for I have very many people in this city.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>So Paul remained in Corinth for a year and six months, teaching among them the Message of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But when Gallio became Proconsul of Greece, the Jews with one accord made a dead set at Paul, and brought him before the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>»This man,« they said, »is inducing people to offer unlawful worship to God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>But, when Paul was about to begin his defence, Gallio said to the Jews, »If it had been some wrongful act or piece of cunning knavery I might reasonably have listened to you Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But since these are questions about words and names and your Law, you yourselves must see to them. I refuse to be a judge in such matters.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>So he ordered them out of court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then the people all set upon Sosthenes, the Warden of the synagogue, and beat him severely in front of the court. Gallio did not concern himself in the least about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>After remaining a considerable time longer in Corinth, Paul took leave of the brethren and set sail for Syria; and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had shaved his head at Cenchreae, because he was bound by a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>They put in at Ephesus, and there Paul left his companions behind. As for himself, he went to the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>When they asked him to remain longer he did not consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but took leave of them with the promise, »I will return to you, God willing.« So he set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>Landing at Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem and inquired after the welfare of the Church, and then went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>After spending some time in Antioch, Paul set out on a tour, visiting the whole of Galatia and Phrygia in order, and strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Meanwhile a Jew named Apollos came to Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria, a man of great learning and well versed in the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>He had been instructed by word of mouth in the way of the Lord, and, being full of burning zeal, he used to speak and teach accurately the facts about Jesus, though he knew of no baptism but John's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Priscilla and Aquila, after hearing him, took him home and explained God's way to him more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>Then, as he had made up his mind to cross over into Greece, the brethren wrote to the disciples in Corinth begging them to give him a kindly welcome. Upon his arrival he rendered valuable help to those who through grace had believed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>for he powerfully and in public overcame the Jews in argument, proving to them from the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>During the stay of Apollos in Corinth, Paul, after passing through the inland districts, came to Ephesus, where he found a few disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>»Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you first believed?« he asked them. »No,« they replied, »we did not even hear that there is a Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>»Into what then were you baptized?« he asked. »Into John's baptism,« they replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>»John,« he said, »administered a baptism of repentance, bidding the people believe on One who was to come after him; namely, on Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>On hearing this, they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>and when Paul laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>They numbered in all about twelve men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>Afterwards he went into the synagogue. There for three months he continued to preach fearlessly, explaining in words which carried conviction the truths which concern the Kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But some grew obstinate in unbelief and spoke evil of the new faith before all the congregation. So Paul left them, and, taking with him those who were disciples, held discussions daily in Tyrannus's lecture-hall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>This went on for two years, so that all the inhabitants of the province of Asia, Jews as well as Greeks, heard the Lord's Message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>God also brought about extraordinary miracles through Paul's instrumentality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>Towels or aprons, for instance, which Paul had handled used to be carried to the sick, and they recovered from their ailments, or the evil spirits left them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>But there were also some wandering Jewish exorcists who undertook to invoke the name of Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, »I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>There were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jew of high-priestly family, who were doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>»Jesus I know,« the evil spirit answered, »and Paul I have heard of, but who are you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom the evil spirit was sprang on two of them, over-mastered them both, and treated them with such violence, that they fled from the house stripped of their clothes and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>All the people of Ephesus, Jews as well as Greeks, came to know of this. There was widespread terror, and they began to hold the name of the Lord Jesus in high honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>Many also of those who believed came confessing without reserve what their conduct had been,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>and not a few of those who had practised magical arts brought their books together and burnt them in the presence of all. The total value was reckoned and found to be 50,000 silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>Thus mightily did the Lord's Message spread and triumph!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>When matters had reached this point, Paul decided in his own mind to travel through Macedonia and Greece, and go to Jerusalem. »After that,« he said, »I must also see Rome.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>But he sent two of his assistants, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself remained for a while in Roman Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>Now just at that time there arose no small commotion about the new faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>There was a certain Demetrius, a silversmith, who made miniature silver sanctuaries of Diana, a business which brought great gain to the mechanics in his employ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>He called his workmen together, and others who were engaged in similar trades, and said to them, »You men well know that our prosperity depends on this business of ours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>and you see and hear that, not in Ephesus only but throughout almost the whole province of Asia, this fellow Paul has led away a vast number of people by inducing them to believe that they are not gods at all that are made by men's hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>There is danger, therefore, not only that this our trade will become of no account, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana will fall into utter disrepute, and that before long she will be actually deposed from her majestic rank–she who is now worshipped by the whole province of Asia; nay, by the whole world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>After listening to this harangue, they became furiously angry and kept calling out, »Great is the Ephesian Diana!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>The riot and uproar spread through the whole city, till at last with one accord they rushed into the Theatre, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, two Macedonians who were fellow travellers with Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>Then Paul would have liked to go in and address the people, but the disciples would not let him do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>A few of the public officials, too, who were friendly to him, sent repeated messages entreating him not to venture into the Theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>The people, meanwhile, kept shouting, some one thing and some another; for the assembly was all uproar and confusion, and the greater part had no idea why they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>Then some of the people crowded round Alexander, whom the Jews had pushed forward; and Alexander, motioning with his hand to get silence, was prepared to make a defence to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>No sooner, however, did they see that he was a Jew, than there arose from them all one roar of shouting, lasting about two hours. »Great is the Ephesian Diana,« they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>At length the Recorder quieted them down. »Men of Ephesus,« he said, »who is there of all mankind that needs to be told that the city of Ephesus is the guardian of the temple of the great Diana and of the image which fell down from Zeus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>These facts, then, being unquestioned, it becomes you to maintain your self-control and not act recklessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For you have brought these men here, who are neither robbers of temples nor blasphemers of our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If, however, Demetrius and the mechanics who support his contention have a grievance against any one, there are Assize-days and there are Proconsuls: let the persons interested accuse one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if you desire anything further, it will have to be settled in the regular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For in connexion with to-day's proceedings there is danger of our being charged with attempted insurrection, there having been no real reason for this riot; nor shall we be able to justify the behaviour of this disorderly mob.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>With these words he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>When the uproar had ceased, Paul sent for the disciples; and, after speaking words of encouragement to them, he took his leave, and started for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>Passing through those districts he encouraged the disciples in frequent addresses, and then came into Greece, and spent three months there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>The Jews having planned to waylay him whenever he might be on the point of taking ship for Syria, he decided to travel back by way of Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>He was accompanied as far as the province of Asia by Sopater the Beroean, the son of Pyrrhus; by the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; by Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and by the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These brethren had gone on and were waiting for us in the Troad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>But we ourselves sailed from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and five days later joined them in the Troad, where we remained for a week.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread, Paul, who was going away the next morning, was preaching to them, and prolonged his discourse till midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>Now there were a good many lamps in the room upstairs where we all were,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>and a youth of the name of Eutychus was sitting at the window. This lad, gradually sinking into deep sleep while Paul preached at unusual length, overcome at last by sleep, fell from the second floor and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>Paul, however, went down, threw himself upon him, and folding him in his arms said, »Do not be alarmed; his life is still in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>Then he went upstairs again, broke bread, and took some food; and after a long conversation which was continued till daybreak, at last he parted from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>They had taken the lad home alive, and were greatly comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>The rest of us had already gone on board a ship, and now we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul on board there; for so he had arranged, he himself intending to go by land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>Accordingly, when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>Sailing from there, we arrived the next day off Chios. On the next we touched at Samos; and on the day following reached Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul's plan was to sail past Ephesus, so as not to spend much time in the province of Asia; since he was very desirous of being in Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of the Harvest Festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>From Miletus he sent to Ephesus for the Elders of the Church to come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>Upon their arrival he said to them, »You Elders well know, from the first day of my setting foot in the province of Asia, the kind of life I lived among you the whole time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord in all humility, and with tears, and amid trials which came upon me through the plotting of the Jews–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>and that I never shrank from declaring to you anything that was profitable, or from teaching you in public and in your homes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>and urging upon both Jews and Greeks the necessity of turning to God and of believing in Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>»And now, impelled by a sense of duty, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>except that the Holy Spirit, at town after town, testifies to me that imprisonment and suffering are awaiting me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But even the sacrifice of my life I count as nothing, if only I may perfect my earthly course, and be faithful to the duty which the Lord Jesus has entrusted to me of proclaiming, as of supreme importance, the Good News of God's grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>»And now, I know that none of you among whom I have gone in and out proclaiming the coming of the Kingdom will any longer see my face.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>Therefore I protest to you to-day that I am not responsible for the ruin of any one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>For I have not shrunk from declaring to you God's whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>»Take heed to yourselves and to all the flock among which the Holy Spirit has placed you to take the oversight for Him and act as shepherds to the Church of God, which He has bought with His own blood.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>I know that, when I am gone, cruel wolves will come among you and will not spare the flock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>and that from among your own selves men will rise up who will seek with their perverse talk to draw away the disciples after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>Therefore be on the alert; and remember that, night and day, for three years, I never ceased admonishing every one, even with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>»And now I commend you to God and to the word of His grace. He is able to build you up and to give you your inheritance among His people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>No one's silver or gold or clothing have I coveted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>You yourselves know that these hands of mine have provided for my own necessities and for the people with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>In all things I have set you an example, showing you that, by working as I do, you ought to help the weak, and to bear in mind the words of the Lord Jesus, how He Himself said, »`It is more blessed to give than to receive.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>Having spoken thus, Paul knelt down and prayed with them all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>and with loud lamentation they all threw their arms round his neck, and kissed him lovingly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>grieved above all things at his having told them that after that day they were no longer to see his face. And they went with him to the ship.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>When, at last, we had torn ourselves away and had set sail, we ran in a straight course to Cos; the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>Finding a ship bound for Phoenicia, we went on board and put to sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>After sighting Cyprus and leaving that island on our left, we continued our voyage to Syria and put in at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload her cargo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>Having searched for the disciples and found them, we stayed at Tyre for seven days; and, taught by the Spirit, they repeatedly urged Paul not to proceed to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>When, however, our time was up, we left and went on our way, all the disciples and their wives and children coming to see us off. Then, after kneeling down on the beach and praying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>we took leave of one another; and we went on board, while they returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>As for us, our voyage was over when having sailed from Tyre we reached Ptolemais. here we inquired after the welfare of the brethren, and remained a day with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>On the morrow we left Ptolemais and went on to Caesarea, where we came to the house of Philip the Evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>Now Philip had four unmarried daughters who were prophetesses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>and during our somewhat lengthy stay a Prophet of the name of Agabus came down from Judaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>When he arrived he took Paul's loincloth, and bound his own feet and arms with it, and said, »Thus says the Holy Spirit, `So will the Jews in Jerusalem bind the owner of this loincloth, and will hand him over to the Gentiles.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>As soon as we heard these words, both we and the brethren at Caesarea entreated Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>His reply was, »What can you mean by thus breaking my heart with your grief? Why, as for me, I am ready not only to go to Jerusalem and be put in chains, but even to die there for the sake of the Lord Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>So when he was not to be dissuaded, we ceased remonstrating with him and said, »The Lord's will be done!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>A few days afterwards we loaded our baggage-cattle and continued our journey to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>Some of the disciples from Caesarea also joined our party, and brought with them Mnason, a Cyprian, one of the early disciples, at whose house we were to lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>At length we reached Jerusalem, and there the brethren gave us a hearty welcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>On the following day we went with Paul to call on James, and all the Elders of the Church came also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>After exchanging friendly greetings, Paul told in detail all that God had done among the Gentiles through his instrumentality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And they, when they had heard his statement, gave the glory to God. Then they said, »You see, brother, how many tens of thousands of Jews there are among those who have accepted the faith, and they are all zealous upholders of the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>Now what they have been repeatedly told about you is that you teach all the Jews among the Gentiles to abandon Moses, and that you forbid them to circumcise their children or observe old-established customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What then ought you to do? They are sure to hear that you have come to Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>so do this which we now tell you. We have four men here who have a vow resting on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Associate with these men and purify yourself with them, and pay their expenses so that they can shave their heads. Then everybody will know that there is no truth in these stories about you, but that in your own actions you yourself scrupulously obey the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>But as for the Gentiles who have accepted the faith, we have communicated to them our decision that they are carefully to abstain from anything sacrificed to an idol, from blood, from what is strangled, and from fornication.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>So Paul associated with the men; and the next day, having purified himself with them, he went into the Temple, giving every one to understand that the days of their purification were finished, and there he remained until the sacrifice for each of them was offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>But, when the seven days were nearly over, the Jews from the province of Asia, having seen Paul in the Temple, set about rousing the fury of all the people against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>They laid hands on him, crying out, »Men of Israel, help! help! This is the man who goes everywhere preaching to everybody against the Jewish people and the Law and this place. And besides, he has even brought Gentiles into the Temple and has desecrated this holy place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>(For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and imagined that Paul had brought him into the Temple.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>The excitement spread through the whole city, and the people rushed in crowds to the Temple, and there laid hold of Paul and began to drag him out; and the Temple gates were immediately closed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>But while they were trying to kill Paul, word was taken up to the Tribune in command of the battalion, that all Jerusalem was in a ferment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>He instantly sent for a few soldiers and their officers, and came down among the people with all speed. At the sight of the Tribune and the troops they ceased beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the Tribune, making his way to him, arrested him, and, having ordered him to be secured with two chains, proceeded to ask who he was and what he had been doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>Some of the crowd shouted one accusation against Paul and some another, until, as the uproar made it impossible for the truth to be ascertained with certainty, the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>When Paul was going up the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for the whole mass of the people pressed on in the rear, shouting, »Away with him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>When he was about to be taken into the barracks, Paul said to the Tribune, »May I speak to you?«»Do you know Greek?« the Tribune asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>»Are you not the Egyptian who some years ago excited the riot of the 4,000 cut-throats, and led them out into the Desert?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>»I am a Jew,« replied Paul, »belonging to Tarsus in Cilicia, and am a citizen of no unimportant city. Give me leave, I pray you, to speak to the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>So with his permission Paul stood on the steps and motioned with his hand to the people to be quiet; and when there was perfect silence he addressed them in Hebrew.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>»Brethren and fathers,« he said, »listen to my defence which I now make before you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And on hearing him address them in Hebrew, they kept all the more quiet; and he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>»I am a Jew, born at Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city. I was carefully trained at the feet of Gamaliel in the Law of our forefathers, and, like all of you to-day, was zealous for God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>I persecuted to death this new faith, continually binding both men and women and throwing them into prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as the High Priest also and all the Elders can bear me witness. It was, too, from them that I received letters to the brethren in Damascus, and I was already on my way to Damascus, intending to bring those also who had fled there, in chains to Jerusalem, to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>»But on my way, when I was now not far from Damascus, about noon a sudden blaze of light from Heaven shone round me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>I fell to the ground and heard a voice say to me, »`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>»`Who art thou, Lord?' I asked.« `I am Jesus, the Nazarene,' He replied, `whom you are persecuting.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>»Now the men who were with me, though they saw the light, did not hear the words of Him who spoke to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And I asked, »`What am I to do, Lord?' «And the Lord said to me, »`Rise, and go into Damascus. There you shall be told of all that has been appointed for you to do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>»And as I could not see because the light had been so dazzling, those who were with me had to lead me by the arm, and so I came to Damascus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>»And a certain Ananias, a pious man who obeyed the Law and bore a good character with all the Jews of the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came to me and standing at my side said, »`Brother Saul, recover your sight.'« I instantly regained my sight and looked up at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>Then he said, `The God of our forefathers has appointed you to know His will, and to see the righteous One and hear Him speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>For you shall be a witness for Him, to all men, of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now why delay? Rise, get yourself baptized, and wash off your sins, calling upon His name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>»After my return to Jerusalem, and while praying in the Temple, I fell into a trance.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>I saw Jesus, and He said to me, »`Make haste and leave Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about Me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>»`Lord,' I replied, `they themselves well know how active I was in imprisoning, and in flogging in synagogue after synagogue those who believe in Thee;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>and when they were shedding the blood of Stephen, Thy witness, I was standing by, fully approving of it, and I held the clothes of those who were killing him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>»`Go,' He replied; `I will send you as an Apostle to nations far away.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>Until they heard this last statement the people listened to Paul, but now with a roar of disapproval they cried out, »Away with such a fellow from the earth! He ought not to be allowed to live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And when they continued their furious shouts, throwing their clothes into the air and flinging dust about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the Tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and be examined by flogging, in order to ascertain the reason why they thus cried out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>But, when they had tied him up with the straps, Paul said to the Captain who stood by, »Does the Law permit you to flog a Roman citizen–and one too who is uncondemned?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>On hearing this question, the Captain went to report the matter to the Tribune. »What are you intending to do?« he said. »This man is a Roman citizen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>So the Tribune came to Paul and asked him, »Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?«»Yes,« he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>»I paid a large sum for my citizenship,« said the Tribune. »But I was born free,« said Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>So the men who had been on the point of putting him under torture immediately left him. And the Tribune, too, was frightened when he learnt that Paul was a Roman citizen, for he had had him bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>The next day, wishing to know exactly what charge was being brought against him by the Jews, the Tribune ordered his chains to be removed; and, having sent word to the High Priests and all the Sanhedrin to assemble, he brought Paul down and made him stand before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>Then Paul, fixing a steady gaze on the Sanhedrin, said, »Brethren, it is with a perfectly clear conscience that I have discharged my duties before God up to this day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>On hearing this the High Priest Ananias ordered those who were standing near Paul to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>»Before long,« exclaimed Paul, »God will strike you, you white-washed wall! Are you sitting there to judge me in accordance with the Law, and do you yourself actually break the Law by ordering me to be struck?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>»Do you rail at God's High Priest?« cried the men who stood by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>»I did not know, brethren,« replied Paul, »that he was the High Priest; for it is written, `Thou shalt not speak evil of a ruler of Thy people.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>Noticing, however, that the Sanhedrin consisted partly of Sadducees and partly of Pharisees, he called out loudly among them, »Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees. It is because of my hope of a resurrection of the dead that I am on my trial.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>These words of his caused an angry dispute between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly took different sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees maintain that there is no resurrection, and neither angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees acknowledge the existence of both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>So there arose a great uproar; and some of the Scribes belonging to the sect of the Pharisees sprang to their feet and fiercely contended, saying, »We find no harm in the man. What if a spirit has spoken to him, or an angel–!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>But when the struggle was becoming violent, the Tribune, fearing that Paul would be torn to pieces by the people, ordered the troops to go down and take him from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>The following night the Lord came and stood at Paul's side, and said, »Be of good courage, for as you have borne faithful witness about me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear witness in Rome.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>Now, when daylight came, the Jews formed a conspiracy and solemnly swore not to eat or drink till they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>There were more than forty of them who bound themselves by this oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>They went to the High Priests and Elders and said to them, »We have bound ourselves under a heavy curse to take no food till we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore you and the Sanhedrin should make representations to the Tribune for him to bring him down to you, under the impression that you intend to inquire more minutely about him; and we are prepared to assassinate him before he comes near the place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But Paul's sister's son heard of the intended attack upon him. So he came and went into the barracks and told Paul about it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>and Paul called one of the Captains and said, »Take this young man to the Tribune, for he has information to give him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took him and brought him to the Tribune, and said, »Paul, the prisoner, called me to him and begged me to bring this youth to you, because he has something to say to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>Then the Tribune, taking him by the arm, withdrew out of the hearing of others and asked him, »What have you to tell me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>»The Jews,« he replied, »have agreed to request you to bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin to-morrow for the purpose of making yourself more accurately acquainted with the case.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>I beg you not to comply; for more than forty men among them are lying in wait for him, who have solemnly vowed that they will neither eat nor drink till they have assassinated him; and even now they are ready, in anticipation of receiving that promise of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>So the Tribune sent the youth home, cautioning him. »Do not let any one know that you have given me this information,« he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>Then, calling to him two of the Captains, he gave his orders. »Get ready two hundred men,« he said, »to march to Caesarea, with seventy cavalry and two hundred light infantry, starting at nine o'clock to-night.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>He further told them to provide horses to mount Paul on, so as to bring him safely to Felix the Governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>He also wrote a letter of which these were the contents:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>»Claudius Lysias to his Excellency, Felix the Governor: all good wishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man Paul had been seized by the Jews, and they were on the point of killing him, when I came upon them with the troops and rescued him, for I had been informed that he was a Roman citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And, wishing to know with certainty the offense of which they were accusing him, I brought him down into their Sanhedrin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>and I discovered that the charge had to do with questions of their Law, but that he was accused of nothing for which he deserves death or imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>But now that I have received information of an intended attack upon him, I immediately send him to you, directing his accusers also to state before you the case they have against him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>So, in obedience to their orders, the soldiers took Paul and brought him by night as far as Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>The next day the infantry returned to the barracks, leaving the cavalry to proceed with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>and, the cavalry having reached Caesarea and delivered the letter to the Governor, they brought Paul also to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>Felix, after reading the letter, inquired from what province he was; and being told »from Cilicia,«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said, »I will hear all you have to say, when your accusers also have come.« And he ordered him to be detained in custody in Herod's Palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>Five days after this, Ananias the High Priest came down to Caesarea with a number of Elders and a pleader called Tertullus. They stated to the Governor the case against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>So Paul was sent for, and Tertullus began to impeach him as follows:»Indebted as we are,« he said, »to you, most noble Felix, for the perfect peace which we enjoy, and for reforms which your wisdom has introduced to this nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>in every instance and in every place we accept them with profound gratitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But –not to detain you too long– I beg you in your forbearance to listen to a brief statement from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man Paul a source of mischief and a disturber of the peace among all the Jews throughout the Empire, and a ringleader in the heresy of the Nazarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>He even attempted to profane the Temple, but we arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>[]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>You, however, by examining him, will yourself be able to learn the truth as to all this which we allege against him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jews also joined in the charge, maintaining that these were facts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>Then, at a sign from the Governor, Paul answered, »Knowing, Sir, that for many years you have administered justice to this nation, I cheerfully make my defence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>For you have it in your power to ascertain that it is not more than twelve days ago that I went up to worship in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>and that neither in the Temple nor in the synagogues, nor anywhere in the city, did they find me disputing with any opponent or collecting a crowd about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>Nor can they prove the charges which they are now bringing against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But this I confess to you–that in the way which they style a heresy, I worship the God of our forefathers, believing everything that is taught in the Law or is written in the Prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>and having a hope directed towards God, which my accusers themselves also entertain, that before long there will be a resurrection both of the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>This too is my own earnest endeavour–always to have a clear conscience in relation to God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>»Now after an interval of several years I came to bring alms to my nation, and to offer sacrifices.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>While I was busy about these, they found me in the Temple purified, with no crowd around me and no uproar; but there were certain Jews from the province of Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>They ought to have been here before you, and to have been my prosecutors, if they have any charge to bring against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these men themselves say what misdemeanour they found me guilty of when I stood before the Sanhedrin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>unless it was in that one expression which I made use of when I shouted out as I stood among them, »`The resurrection of the dead is the thing about which I am on my trial before you to-day.'«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>At this point Felix, who was fairly well informed about the new faith, adjourned the trial, saying to the Jews, »When the Tribune Lysias comes down, I will enter carefully into the matter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he gave orders to the Captain that Paul was to be kept in custody, but be treated with indulgence, and that his personal friends were not to be prevented from showing him kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>Not long after this, Felix came with Drusilla his wife, a Jewess, and sending for Paul, listened to him as he spoke about faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>But when he dealt with the subjects of justice, self-control, and the judgement which was soon to come, Felix became alarmed and said, »For the present leave me, and when I can find a convenient opportunity I will send for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>At the same time he hoped that Paul would give him money; and for this reason he sent for him the oftener to converse with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But after the lapse of fully two years Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and being desirous of gratifying the Jews, Felix left Paul still in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Festus, having entered on his duties as governor of the province, two days later went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>The High Priests and the leading men among the Jews immediately made representations to him against Paul, and begged him–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking it as a favour, to Paul's prejudice–to have him brought to Jerusalem. They were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Festus, however, replied that Paul was in custody in Caesarea, and that he was himself going there very soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>»Therefore let those of you,« he said, »who can come, go down with me, and impeach the man, if there is anything amiss in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>After a stay of eight or ten days in Jerusalem –not more– he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, taking his seat on the tribunal, he ordered Paul to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>Upon Paul's arrival, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood round him, and brought many grave charges against him which they were unable to substantiate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>But, in reply, Paul said, »Neither against the Jewish Law, nor against the Temple, nor against Caesar, have I committed any offence whatever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>Then Festus, being anxious to gratify the Jews, asked Paul, »Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem, and there stand your trial before me on these charges?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>»I am standing before Caesar's tribunal,« replied Paul, »where alone I ought to be tried. The Jews have no real ground of complaint against me, as in fact you yourself are beginning to see more clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If, however, I have done wrong and have committed any offence for which I deserve to die, I do not ask to be excused that penalty. But if there is no truth in what these men allege against me, no one has the right to give me up to them as a favour. I appeal to Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then, after conferring with the Council, Festus replied, »To Caesar you have appealed: to Caesar you shall go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>A short time after this, Agrippa the king and Bernice came to Caesarea to pay a complimentary visit to Festus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>and, during their rather long stay, Festus laid Paul's case before the king. »There is a man here,« he said, »whom Felix left a prisoner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>about whom, when I went to Jerusalem, the High Priests and the Elders of the Jews made representations to me, begging that sentence might be pronounced against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>My reply was that it is not the custom among the Romans to give up any one for punishment before the accused has had his accusers face to face, and has had an opportunity of defending himself against the charge which has been brought against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>»When, therefore, a number of them came here, the next day I took my seat on the tribunal, without any loss of time, and ordered the man to be brought in.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>But, when his accusers stood up, they did not charge him with the misdemeanours of which I had been suspecting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>But they quarrelled with him about certain matters connected with their own religion, and about one Jesus who had died, but –so Paul persistently maintained– is now alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>I was at a loss how to investigate such questions, and asked Paul whether he would care to go to Jerusalem and there stand his trial on these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But when Paul appealed to have his case kept for the Emperor's decision, I ordered him to be kept in prison until I could send him up to Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>»I should like to hear the man myself,« said Agrippa. »to-morrow,« replied Festus, »you shall.« Accordingly, the next day, Agrippa and Bernice came in state</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>and took their seats in the Judgement Hall, attended by the Tribunes and the men of high rank in the city; and, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>Then Festus said, »King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see here the man about whom the whole nation of the Jews made suit to me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>I could not discover that he had done anything for which he deserved to die; but as he has himself appealed to the Emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>I have nothing very definite, however, to tell our Sovereign about him. So I have brought the man before you all –and especially before you, King Agrippa– that after he has been examined I may find something which I can put into writing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For, when sending a prisoner to Rome, it seems to me to be absurd not to state the charges against him.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, »You have permission to speak about yourself.« So Paul, with outstretched arm, proceeded to make his defence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>»As regards all the accusations brought against me by the Jews,« he said, »I think myself fortunate, King Agrippa, in being about to defend myself to-day before you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>who are so familiar with all the customs and speculations that prevail among the Jews; and for this reason, I pray you, give me a patient hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>»The kind of life I have lived from my youth upwards, as exemplified in my early days among my nation and in Jerusalem, is known to all the Jews.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>For they all know me of old –if they would but testify to the fact– how, being an adherent of the strictest sect of our religion, my life was that of a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand here impeached because of my hope in the fulfilment of the promise made by God to our forefathers–</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>the promise which our twelve tribes, worshipping day and night with intense devotedness, hope to have made good to them. It is on the subject of this hope, Sir, that I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it deemed with all of you a thing past belief if God raises the dead to life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>»I myself, however, thought it a duty to do many things in hostility to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>And that was how I acted in Jerusalem. Armed with authority received from the High Priests I shut up many of God's people in various prisons, and when they were about to be put to death I gave my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>In all the synagogues also I punished them many a time, and tried to make them blaspheme; and in my wild fury I chased them even to foreign towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>»While thus engaged, I was travelling one day to Damascus armed with authority and a commission from the High Priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>and on the journey, at noon, Sir, I saw a light from Heaven –brighter than the brightness of the sun– shining around me and around those who were travelling with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>We all fell to the ground; and I heard a voice which said to me in Hebrew, »`Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? You are finding it painful to kick against the ox-goad.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>»`Who art Thou, Lord?' I asked.« `I am Jesus whom you are persecuting,' the Lord replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>`But rise, and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you My servant and My witness both as to the things you have already seen and as to those in which I will appear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>I will save you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles, to whom I send you to open their eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>that they may turn from darkness to light and from the obedience to Satan to God, in order to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified through faith in Me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>»Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision;«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but I proceeded to preach first to the people in Damascus, and then to those in Jerusalem and in all Judaea, and to the Gentiles, that they must repent and turn to God, and live lives consistent with such repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>»It was on this account that the Jews seized me in the Temple and tried to kill me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Having, however, obtained the help which is from God, I have stood firm until now, and have solemnly exhorted rich and poor alike, saying nothing except what the Prophets and Moses predicted as soon to happen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>since the Christ was to be a suffering Christ, and by coming back from the dead was then to be the first to proclaim a message of light both to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>As Paul thus made his defence, Festus exclaimed in a loud voice, »You are raving mad, Paul; and great learning is driving you mad.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>»I am not mad, most noble Festus,« replied Paul; »I am speaking words of sober truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the King, to whom I speak freely, knows about these matters. I am not to be persuaded that any detail of them has escaped his notice; for these things have not been done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, do you believe the Prophets? I know that you believe them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Agrippa answered, »In brief, you are doing your best to persuade me to become a Christian.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>»My prayer to God, whether briefly or at length,« replied Paul, »would be that not only you but all who are my hearers to-day, might become such as I am–except these chains.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>So the King rose, and the Governor, and Bernice, and those who were sitting with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>and, having withdrawn, they talked to one another and said, »This man is doing nothing for which he deserves death or imprisonment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, »He might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Caesar.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>Now when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they handed over Paul and a few other prisoners into the custody of Julius, a Captain of the Augustan battalion;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>and going on board a ship of Adramyttium which was about to sail to the ports of the province of Asia, we put to sea; Aristarchus, the Macedonian, from Thessalonica, forming one of our party.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>The next day we put in at Sidon. There Julius treated Paul with thoughtful kindness and allowed him to visit his friends and profit by their generous care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>Putting to sea again, we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>and, sailing the whole length of the sea that lies off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we reached Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>There Julius found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy, and put us on board of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>It took several days of slow sailing for us to come with difficulty off Cnidus; from which point, as the wind did not allow us to get on in the direct course, we ran under the lee of Crete by Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>Then, coasting along with difficulty, we reached a place called `Fair Havens,' near the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>Our voyage thus far had occupied a considerable time, and the navigation being now unsafe and the Fast also already over, Paul warned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>»Sirs,« he said, »I perceive that before long the voyage will be attended with danger and heavy loss, not only to the cargo and the ship but to our own lives also.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But Julius let himself be persuaded by the pilot and by the owner rather than by Paul's arguments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>and as the harbour was inconvenient for wintering in, the majority were in favour of putting out to sea, to try whether they could get to Phoenix –a harbour on the coast of Crete facing north-east and south-east– to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And a light breeze from the south sprang up, so that they supposed they were now sure of their purpose. So weighing anchor they ran along the coast of Crete, hugging the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But it was not long before a furious north-east wind, coming down from the mountains, burst upon us and carried the ship out of her course.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>She was unable to make headway against the gale; so we gave up and let her drive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>Then we ran under the lee of a little island called Cauda, where we managed with great difficulty to secure the boat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>and, after hoisting it on board, they used frapping-cables to undergird the ship, and, as they were afraid of being driven on the Syrtis quicksands, they lowered the gear and lay to.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>But, as the storm was still violent, the next day they began to lighten the ship;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>and, on the third day, with their own hands they threw the ship's spare gear overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>Then, when for several days neither sun nor stars were seen and the terrific gale still harassed us, the last ray of hope was now vanishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>When for a long time they had taken but little food, Paul, standing up among them, said, »Sirs, you ought to have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete. You would then have escaped this suffering and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>But now take courage, for there will be no destruction of life among you, but of the ship only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For there stood by my side, last night, an angel of the God to whom I belong, and whom also I worship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>and he said, »`Dismiss all fear, Paul, for you must stand before Caesar; and God has granted you the lives of all who are sailing with you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>»Therefore, Sirs, take courage; for I believe God, and am convinced that things will happen exactly as I have been told.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But we are to be stranded on a certain island.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>It was now the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Sea of Adria, when, about midnight, the sailors suspected that land was close at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>So they hove the lead and found twenty fathoms of water; and after a short time they hove again and found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Then for fear of possibly running on rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern and waited impatiently for daylight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>The sailors, however, wanted to make their escape from the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, pretending that they were going to lay out anchors from the bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>But Paul, addressing Julius and the soldiers, said, »Your lives will be sacrificed, unless these men remain on board.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut the ropes of the ship's boat and let her fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And continually, up till daybreak, Paul kept urging all on board to take some food. »This is the fourteenth day,« he said, »that you have been anxiously waiting for the storm to cease, and have fasted, eating little or nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>I therefore strongly advise you to take some food. This is essential for your safety. For not a hair will perish from the head of any one of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>Having said this he took some bread, and, after giving thanks to God for it before them all, he broke it in pieces and began to eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>This raised the spirits of all, and they too took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>There were 276 of us, crew and passengers, all told.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>After eating a hearty meal they lightened the ship by throwing the wheat overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>When daylight came, they tried in vain to recognise the coast. But an inlet with a sandy beach attracted their attention, and now their object was, if possible, to run the ship aground in this inlet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>So they cut away the anchors and left them in the sea, unloosing at the same time the bands which secured the paddle-rudders. Then, hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But coming to a place where two seas met, they stranded the ship, and her bow sticking fast remained immovable, while the stern began to go to pieces under the heavy hammering of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>Now the soldiers recommended that the prisoners should be killed, for fear some one of them might swim ashore and effect his escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But their Captain, bent on securing Paul's safety, kept them from their purpose and gave orders that those who could swim should first jump overboard and get to land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and that the rest should follow, some on planks, and others on various things from the ship. In this way they all got safely to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>Our lives having been thus preserved, we discovered that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The strange-speaking natives showed us remarkable kindness, for they lighted a fire and made us all welcome because of the pelting rain and the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Now, when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and had thrown them on the fire, a viper, driven by the heat, came out and fastened itself on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>When the natives saw the creature hanging to his hand, they said to one another, »Beyond doubt this man is a murderer, for, though saved from the sea, unerring Justice does not permit him to live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>He, however, shook the reptile off into the fire and was unhurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>They expected him soon to swell with inflammation or suddenly fall down dead; but, after waiting a long time and seeing no harm come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>Now in the same part of the island there were estates belonging to the Governor, whose name was Publius. He welcomed us to his house, and for three days generously made us his guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>It happened, however, that his father was lying ill of dysentery aggravated by attacks of fever; so Paul went to see him, and, after praying, laid his hands on him and cured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>After this, all the other sick people in the island came and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They also loaded us with honours, and when at last we sailed they put supplies on board for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>Three months passed before we set sail in an Alexandrian vessel, called the `Twin Brothers,' which had wintered at the island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>At Syracuse we put in and stayed for two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>From there we came round and reached Rhegium; and a day later, a south wind sprang up which brought us by the evening of the next day to Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>Here we found brethren, who invited us to remain with them for a week; and so we reached Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>Meanwhile the brethren there, hearing of our movements, came as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Huts to meet us; and when Paul saw them he thanked God and felt encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>Upon our arrival in Rome, Paul received permission to live by himself, guarded by a soldier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>After one complete day he invited the leading men among the Jews to meet him; and, when they were come together, he said to them, »As for me, brethren, although I had done nothing prejudicial to our people or contrary to the customs of our forefathers, I was handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the power of the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>They, after they had sharply questioned me, were willing to set me at liberty, because they found no offence in me for which I deserve to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But, at last, the opposition of the Jews compelled me to appeal to Caesar; not however that I had any charge to bring against my nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For these reasons, then, I have invited you here, that I might see you and speak to you; for it is for the sake of Him who is the hope of Israel that this chain hangs upon me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>»For our part,« they replied, »we have not received any letters from Judaea about you, nor have any of our countrymen come here and reported or stated anything to your disadvantage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we should be glad to hear from you what it is that you believe; for as for this sect all we know is that it is everywhere spoken against.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>So they arranged a day with him and came to him in considerable numbers at the house of the friends who were entertaining him. And then, with solemn earnestness, he explained to them the subject of the Kingdom of God, endeavouring from morning till evening to convince them about Jesus, both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some were convinced; others refused to believe.</verse>
