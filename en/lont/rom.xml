  <div type='book' osisID='Rom'>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called Apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>(which he formerly announced by his prophets, in the Sacred Writings,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; descended from David, as to his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>and constituted the Son of God, with power, as to his holy spiritual nature, after his resurrection from the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>by whom we have received favor, even the apostolic office, for the obedience of faith among all nations, for his name's sake:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom are you, also, called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints; favor be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First of all, I thank my God, through the Lord Jesus Christ, for you all, that your faith is published in all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve sincerely in the gospel of his Son, that continually I make mention of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>always in my prayers, requesting that, by some means, now at length, I may have a prosperous journey, (God willing,) to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>and that I may be comforted, together with you, through the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now, brethren, I would not have you ignorant, that I often purposed to come to you, thought I have, as yet been hindered; that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am a debtor, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>Therefore, I am willing, according to my ability, to declare the glad tidings, even to you who are in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel; because it is the power of God for salvation, to every one who believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>«For in it the justification of God by faith is revealed, in order to faith; as it is written,» 'Now the just by faith, shall live.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>Besides the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth by unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because that which may be known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>(for his invisible attributes, even his eternal power and divinity, since the creation of the world, are very evident; being known by his works:) so that they are inexcusable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because, though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, neither gave him thanks; but became foolish by their own reasonings, and their inconsiderate heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing to be wise men, they became fools:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>for they changed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of an image of mortal man, of fowls, or four-footed beasts, and of reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore, also, God, through the lusts of their own hearts, delivered them over to uncleanness, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>Who changed the truth concerning God, into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is forever blessed. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this, God delivered them over to shameful passions; for even their females changed the natural use unto what is contrary to nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>In like manner, also, the males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust toward one another, males with males, working out that which is shameful, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And as they did not like to acknowledge God, God delivered them over to an undiscerning mind, to work those things which are not suitable;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all injustice, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, bad habits, whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>revilers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil pleasure, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>impudent, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Some, who clearly understand the law of God, (that they who practice such things are worthy of death,) not only do these things, but even commend those who practice them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Wherefore, you are inexcusable, O man! whosoever you are, who condemn: for in condemning another, you pass sentence upon yourself; because you, who condemn, practice the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>Besides, we know that the sentence of God is according to truth, upon them who commit such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And do you think this, O man, who condemn those who practice such things, and yet do the same, that you shall escape the sentence of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not acknowledging that the goodness of God invites you to a reformation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But according to your obdurate and impenitent heart, you treasure up to yourself wrath, against a day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who will render to every one according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>eternal life, indeed, to them who, by perseverance in well-doing, seek glory, honor, and immortality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>but anger and wrath to them who are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Affliction and great distress shall come upon every soul of man who works evil; first of the Jews, and also of the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory, honor, and peace to every one who works good: first to the Jews, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>As many, therefore, as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned under law, shall be condemned by law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>for not those who hear the law are just before God; but those who obey the law, shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>When, therefore, the Gentiles, who have not a law, do by nature the things of the law, are a law to themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>who show plainly the work of the law, written on their hearts; their conscience bearing witness, and also their reasonings between one another, when they accuse or excuse each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>In the day when God will judge the hidden things of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>If, now, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and boast in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed by the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and boast that you yourselves are a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>and instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the representation of knowledge and of truth in the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>you, then, who teach another; do you not teach yourself? You who proclaim, Do not steal; do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You who command, Do not commit adultery; do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols; do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You who boast in the law; by the breaking of the law, do you dishonor God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>«For it is written,» 'The name of God is evil spoken of among the Gentiles, through you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Now circumcision indeed profits, if you practice law; but if you be a transgressor of law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>And if the uncircumcision keep the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And will not the uncircumcision which by nature fulfills the law, condemn you, a transgressor of law, though in possession of the scriptures and circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What is the pre-eminence of the Jew, then? or what profit is there of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much, in every respect: chiefly, indeed, because they were entrusted with the Oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For, what if some did not believe-will not their unbelief destroy the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>«By no means. But let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written,» 'That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mayest overcome when thou judgest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness display the justice of God, what shall we say? Is not God unjust, who inflicts vengeance? (I speak after the manner of men.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>By no means: otherwise, how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>Still, if the truth of God has, through my lie, more abounded to his glory, why am I also yet condemned as a sinner-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>and not because we have done evil that good may come, as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we teach-whose condemnation is just?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Do we excel? Not at all. For we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles to be all under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>«As it is written,» 'Surely there is none righteous; no, not one.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none that understands; there is none that seeks after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They are all gone out of the way: they are together become unprofitable. There is none that does good; there is not so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat is an open sepulcher: with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery lurk in their paths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>but the path of peace they have not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>«There is no fear of God before their eyes.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatever things the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and that all the world may be liable to punishment before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Wherefore, by works of law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight; because through law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now, a justification which is of God, without law, is exhibited, attested by the law and the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>even a justification which is of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, for all, and upon all, who believe; for there is no difference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all, having sinned and come short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>are justified freely by his favor, through the redemption which is by Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God has set forth a propitiatory, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his own justice, in passing by the sins which were before committed, through the forbearance of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>for a demonstration, also, of his justice in the present time, in order that he may be just, when justifying him, who is of the faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>We conclude, then, that by faith man is justified, without works of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is he the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gentiles, also? Yes, of the Gentiles, also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>Seeing there is one God, he will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we, then, make law useless through the faith? By no means: but we establish law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What do we then say that Abraham our father obtained by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>for if Abraham were justified by works, he might boast; but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>«For what says the scripture?» 'And Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now, to him who works, the reward is not counted as a favor, but as a debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>In like manner, also, David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God counts righteousness without works: saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>«Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>«Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not count sin.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Does this blessedness come, then, on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision, also? for we affirm that faith was counted to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How, then, was it counted? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had whilst uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all uncircumcised believers, that righteousness might be counted even to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And a father to the circumcised, who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham, which he had whilst in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise to Abraham, that he should be the heir of a world, was not to him, nor to his seed, through law; but through a righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of law are heirs; faith is rendered vain, and the promise is made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Farther, the law works out wrath; but where law is not, there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>For this reason, it is through faith that it might be by favor, that the promise might be sure to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law; but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>«(as it is written,'Surely a father of many nations have I constituted you,') in the presence of him whom he believed, even of God, who makes alive the dead, and calls things which exist not, as though they existed.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>«He, contrary to hope, believed with hope, that he should be a father of many nations, according to what was spoken,» 'So shall your seed be.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body now dead, being about a hundred years old; neither the deadness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>Therefore, against the promise of God, through unbelief, he did not dispute; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>And was fully persuaded that what was promised, he was able to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>Therefore, also, it was counted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for his sake only, that it was so counted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>even to those who believe on him who raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised up again for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Wherefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>through whom we have had introduction, also, by faith, into this favor in which we stand, and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>and not only so, but we rejoice even in afflictions; knowing that affliction produces patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and patience, approbation; and approbation, hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And this hope makes not ashamed: because the love of God is diffused in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, that is given us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>Besides, we being yet weak, in the appointed time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Now, scarcely for a just man will one die, though for a good man one would, perhaps, even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God recommends his love to us; because, while we were yet sinner, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more, then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so, but we even rejoice in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, though whom we have now received reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Wherefore, as sin entered into the world by one man, in whom all sinned, and by sin, death: thus death came upon all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>(For sin was in the world until the law: but sin is not imputed, when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them who had not sinned, in the manner of Adam's transgression, who is a type of him that was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But not as the offense, so also is the free gift: for if by the offense of the one, the many died; much more the favor of God, and the gift by favor, which is of the one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And not as through one who sinner, is the free gift: for the sentence was from one to condemnation; but the free gift is from many offenses to justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by the offense of the one, death reigned by the one; much more shall they who receive the abundance of favor, and of the gift of justification, reign in life, by the one-Jesus Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Now, therefore, as through one offense, the sentence came upon all men to condemnation: so, also, by one act of obedience, the sentence came upon all men to justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For, as through the disobedience of the one, the many were constituted sinners; so, by the obedience of the one, the many shall be constituted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Moreover, the law supervened, that the offense might abound; but where sin abounded, favor superabounded-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>that as sin reigned by death, so, also, favor might reign by justification to eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What do we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that favor may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>By no means. How shall we, who have died to sin, continue to live in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Do you not know, that as many as have been immersed into Jesus Christ, have been immersed into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We have been buried, then, together with him, by the immersion into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father; so we also shall walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death; we shall then, also, certainly be in the likeness of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we should not any longer serve sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>for he that has died is released from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies not again; death has no longer dominion over him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>for that he has died, he has died for sin once: but that he lives, he lives for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So reckon yourselves also dead, indeed, to sin; but alive to God, by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, by obeying it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither present your members as instruments of unrighteousness, to sin; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead; and your members as instruments of righteousness, to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>Besides, sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under law, but under favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then do we say? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under favor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Do you not know, that to whom you present yourselves servants, by obedience; his servants you are whom you thus obey; whether of sin into death, or of obedience into righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But, thanks to God, that though you were the servants of sin; yet you have heartily obeyed that model of doctrine to which you have been given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>And being made free from sin, you have become the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>(I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh.) Wherefore, as you have presented your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity, to work iniquity; so present now your members, servants to righteousness, to work holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>And what fruit had you, then, from these things of which you are now ashamed? for the reward of these things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now, being set free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit to holiness: and the end, everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin is death: but the gracious gift of God is everlasting life, by Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Do you not know, brethren, (for I speak to them who know law,) that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the married woman is bound, by law, to her husband as long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is released from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>If, then, indeed, while her husband lives, she be married to another, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from the law; so that she is not an adulteress, though married to another husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Thus, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law, by the body of Christ, that you may be married to another, who rose from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, our sinful passions which were through the law, wrought effectually in our members, to bring forth fruit to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now, having died with Christ, we are released from the law, by which we were held in bondage; so that we may serve God in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>«What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? By no means. Indeed, I had not known sin, except by the law. For I had not known even inordinate desire, unless the law had said,» 'You shall not lust.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of inordinate desire: for without the law sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>For I was alive, once, without the law: but when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>Yes, the commandment which was for live, the very same was found to be death to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>Wherefore, the law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Has, then, that which is good become death to me? By no means. But sin becomes death, in order that it might manifest itself, causing death to me by that which is good: so that sin, (through the commandment,) might be an exceedingly great sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>Besides, we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do, I do not approve; since it is not what I desire that I do: but I do that which I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If, now, I do that which I do not desire, I consent to the law that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>But now it is no longer I myself who do this; but sin which dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells no good thing: for to desire what is good, is easy for me; but to do it, I find difficult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good which I desire, that I do not: but the evil which I desire not, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now, if I do that which I do not desire, it is no longer I who do it; but sin, which dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find, then, that it is a law to me, when desirous to do good, that evil is near me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I take pleasure in the law of God, as to the inner man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I perceive another law, in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and making me a captive to the law of sin, which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Wherefore, then, indeed, I myself serve, with my mind, the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is, then, no condemnation, now, to those who are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of Life by Christ Jesus, has freed me from the law of sin, and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not accomplish in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, accomplished; and by an offering for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled by us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>Now, they who live according to the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; and they who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>But the mind of the flesh is death; and the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>because the mind of the flesh is enmity toward God: for, to the law of God it is not subject; neither, indeed, can be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>Those, then, who are in the flesh, can not please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>Now, you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; because the Spirit of God dwells in you. But, if any one have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>And if Christ be in you, the body, indeed, is dead, with respect to sin; but the Spirit is life, with respect to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>For, if the Spirit of him, who raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he who raised up Christ from the dead, will make even your mortal bodies alive, through his Spirit, who dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Well, then, brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>Wherefore, if you live according to the flesh, you shall die; but if, through the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>Because, as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you have not received the spirit of bondage, again, to fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>Also this spirit bears witness, together with our spirit, that we are children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, then heirs; heirs, indeed, of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if, indeed, we suffer with him, that with him also we may be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>However, I esteem not the sufferings of the present time, as worthy of comparison with the glory, which is hereafter to be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creature, is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creature was subjected to frailty, (not of its own choice, but by him who has subjected it,) in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that it may be liberated, from the bondage of a perishing state, and brought into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>Besides, we know, that the whole creation sigh together, and travail in anguish till the present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruit of the Spirit; even we ourselves, groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption; namely, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For even we are saved by hope. Now, hope that is attained, is not hope; for who can hope for that which he enjoys?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for that which we do not enjoy, then, with patience, we wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>In like manner, also, the Spirit helps our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for, as we ought; however, the Spirit himself intercedes for us, in sighs, which can not be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But he who searches the hearts, knows the mind of the Spirit; that, according to the will of God, he makes intercession for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>Besides, we know, that all things work together for good, to them who love God; to them, who are called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>For, whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be conformed to the image of his Son; that he might be the first born among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>Moreover, whom he predestinated, them he also called; and whom he called, them he also justified; and whom he justified, them he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What shall we say, then, to these things? Since God is for us, who can be against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He, certainly, who spared not his own Son, but delivered him up for us all; how will he not, with him, also, graciously give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who will bring an accusation against the elect of God? Is it God who justifies them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he, who condemns them? It is Christ, who died; or rather, who has risen: who also, is at the right hand of God; and who makes intercession for us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who will separate us from the love of Christ? Will affliction, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>«As it is written,» 'Truly, for thy sake, we are put to death all the day long; we are accounted as sheep for the slaughter.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>Nay, in all these things, we do more than overcome, through him who has loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded, that neither death, nor life; neither angels, nor principalities; nor powers; neither things present, nor to come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>neither height, nor depth; nor any created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>Now, if some of the branches were broken off, and you who are a wild olive, are engrafted among them, and are become a joint partaker of the root and fatness of the olive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>boast not against the branches: but if you boast, still, you bear not the root, but the root you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>You will say, however, The branches were broken off, that I might be grafted in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>True: by unbelief they were broken off, and you by faith, stand. Be not high-minded, but fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>For, if God spared not the natural branches; perhaps, neither will he spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold, then, the goodness and severity of God! Toward them who fell, severity: but toward you, goodness, if you continue in his goodness: otherwise, you also shall be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And even they, if they continued not in unbelief, shall be grafted in: for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if you were cut off from the olive, by nature wild, and were contrary to nature, grafted into the good olive; how much rather shall those who are the natural branches, be grafted into their own olive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For, brethren, that you may not be, wise in your own conceits, I would not have you ignorant of this secret, that blindness, in part, has happened to Israel, till the fullness of the Gentiles come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>«And so all Israel shall be saved; as it is written,» 'The deliverer shall come out of Zion, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>«For this is my covenant with them, when I shall take away their sins.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>With respect to the gospel, indeed, they are enemies, on your account: but with respect to the election, they are beloved on account of the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>For the free gifts and calling of God are without repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>Besides, as you, in times past, have disobeyed God, yet now have obtained mercy through their disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>even so these, also, have no disobeyed, that through your mercy, they also may obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God has shut up together all for disobedience, that he might have mercy upon all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>Oh that depth of the riches and of the wisdom and of the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who has known the mind of the Lord? or who has been his counsellor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>or who has first given to him, and it shall be recompensed to him again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For, from him, and by him, and to him, are all things: to him be the glory forever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>Wherefore, brethren, I beseech you, by the tender mercies of God, that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable to God, which is your reasonable service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>And be not conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind; that you may approve the will of God, which is good, and acceptable, and perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>Also, by the favor which is given to me, I charge every one of you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think modestly, as God has distributed to every one a portion of his faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For, as in one body we have many members, but all the members have not the same office;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>so we, the many, are one body under Christ, and individually members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Having, then, gifts, differing according to the favor which is given to us-if prophecy act according to the measure of faith-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>if a ministerial office, in that office-if one is a teacher, in teaching-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>and the exhorter, in exhortation. Let him who distributes act with disinterestedness-him that presides, with assiduity-him that shows mercy, with cheerfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let love be without hypocrisy. Abhor the evil-adhere closely to the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>In brotherly love, be tenderly affectionate to one another-in honor, prefer one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>In business, be not slothful. Be fervent in spirit- constant in serving the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>Be joyful in hope, patient in affliction, steadfastly persevering in prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>Communicate to the necessities of the saints. Follow hospitality to strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Bless them who persecute you-bless, and curse not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with them who rejoice, and weep with them who weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Be of the same disposition toward one another. Do not care for high things; but accommodate yourselves to those which are humble. Be not wise in your own conceits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>To no one return evil for evil. Seek after things honorable in the sight of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>What relates to you is, live in peace with all men, if possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>«Beloved, do not avenge yourselves, but give place to the wrath of God; for it is written,» 'Vengeance belongs to me; I will repay, says the Lord.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>Therefore, if your enemy hunger, give him food: if he thirst, give him drink: for by doing this, you will heap coals of fire on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Be not overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul be subject to the higher powers. For there is no power but from God; and those that exist are placed under God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Wherefore, he who sets himself in opposition to the power, resists the ordinance of God: and they who resist shall procure punishment to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to evil. Would you, then, not be afraid of the power? Do that which is good, and you shall have praise of the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For the ruler is a servant of God for good to you. But if you do that which is evil, be afraid; because he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is a servant of God, a revenger to inflict wrath on him who works evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Wherefore, it is necessary for you to be subject, not only on account of punishment, but also on account of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For this reason, therefore, you pay taxes also to them, because they are public ministers of God, attending continually to this very business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render, therefore, to all their dues; to whom tax is due, tax; to whom custom, custom; to whom fear, fear; to whom honor, honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no man anything, unless to love one another. For he who loves another, has fulfilled the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>«For this,'You shall not commit adultery, You shall not kill, You shall not covet'; and if there be any other commandment, it is summed up in this precept, namely,» 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love works no evil to one's neighbor: therefore, love the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>Further, knowing the season, that it is now the hour for us to awake out of sleep. (For now our salvation is nearer than when we believed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>the night is far advanced, and the day is at hand.) Let us, therefore, put off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us walk about decently, as in the day, not in revellings and drunkenness; not in chamberings and lasciviousness; not in strife and envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the lusts of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>Receive him who is weak in the faith, without regard to differences of opinions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>One, indeed, believes he may eat everything; but he who is weak eats herbs only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>Let not him who eats, despise him who eats not; and let not him who eats not, condemn him who eats: for God has received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who are you that condemn another man's servant? By his own master he stands or falls; and he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One, indeed, thinks one day more holy than another: but another thinks every day alike. Let every one be convinced in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who observes the day, observe it to the Lord; and he who does not observe the day to the Lord, does not observe it: he who eats, eats to the Lord, for he gives God thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>But whether we live, we live to the Lord; and whether we die, we die to the Lord: whether we live, therefore, or die, we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end, Christ both dies and rose, and lives again, that he might rule over both the dead and the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But you, why do you condemn your brother? and you, also, why do you despise your brother? for we shall all be placed before the judgment seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>«For it is written,» 'As I live, says the Lord, surely every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>Well, then, every one of us shall give an account of himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Let us, therefore, no more judge one another; but let us decide, rather, not to lay an occasion of stumbling before a brother, or a cause of falling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know, and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself; yet, to him who accounts anything to be unclean, to that man it is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>Now, if your brother be hurt through your meat, you no longer walk as love requires. Do not destroy him with your meat for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not your good, then, be an evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the Reign of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness and peace, and joy, in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>And he who, by these things, serves Christ, is acceptable to God, and approved by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Well, then, let us strive after peace, and mutual edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Do not, for the sake of meat, destroy the work of God. All meats, indeed, are clean; but that meat is hurtful to the man who eats to occasion stumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is good neither to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything by which your brother is made to stumble, or to fall, or is weakened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>You have faith: keep it to yourself, in the sight of God. Happy is he who does not condemn himself in what he approves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>For he who discerns a difference, between meats is condemned, if he eat; because he eats not from faith: for what is not from faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>We, then, who are strong, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Wherefore, let every one of us please his neighbor, as far as it is good for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>«For even Christ sought not his own pleasure: but, as it is written,» 'The reproaches of them who reproached you, have fallen on me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>Now whatever things were before written, were written for our instruction: that through the patience and admonition of the scriptures, we might have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>Now, may the God who gives patience and admonition, give to you mutual unity of sentiment, according to Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>That with one mind, and with one voice, you may glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Wherefore, cordially receive one another; even as Christ also has received us to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>Now, I affirm that Jesus Christ became a minister of the circumcision on account of the truth of God, in order to confirm the promises made to the fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>«and that the Gentiles might praise God on account of mercy: as it is written,» 'For this cause I will glorify thee among the Gentiles, and sing to thy name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>«And again he says,» 'Rejoice, you Gentiles, with his people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>«And again,» 'Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles; and extol him, all you people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>«And again, Isaiah says, to be a leader of the Gentiles; upon him shall the Gentiles place their hope.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>Now, may the God of hope fill you with all joy, and peace, in believing; in order that you may abound in that hope, through the power of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>However, my brethren, I myself am persuaded concerning you, that you also are full of goodness, being filled with all knowledge; able, also, to instruct one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But, I have written the more boldly to you, brethren; partly, as calling things to your remembrance through the favor which is given me of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>In order to my being a minister of Jesus Christ, among the Gentiles, ministering the gospel of God, that there might be an offering of the Gentiles most acceptable; being sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I have, therefore, glorifying, through Christ Jesus, with respect to things pertaining to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>But, I will not dare to speak anything of what Christ has not wrought; but, of what he has wrought, by me, in order to the obedience of the Gentiles in word and deed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of the Holy Spirit: so that from Jerusalem, and round about, as far as Illyricum, I have fully declared the gospel of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>and so, also, that I was strongly desirous to declare the gospel where Christ was not named, that I might not build on another's foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>«But, as it is written,» 'They shall see, to whom nothing has been told concerning him; and they who have not heard, shall understand.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For which reason, also, I have been greatly hindered from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now, having no more place in these parts, and having for many years a strong desire to come to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>whensoever I go toward Spain, I hope, as I pass on, to see you, and to be brought on my way thither by you, when I shall first, in some measure, be satisfied with your company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I go to Jerusalem, ministering to the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>for Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor of the saints who are in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>They have been pleased, indeed; and their debtors they are: for if the Gentiles have partaken of their spiritual things, they ought certainly to minister to them in temporal things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>Wherefore, having finished this affair, and having sealed to them this fruit, I will go from thence by you into Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I know when I come to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now, I beseech you, brethren, by the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit, that you strive together with me, by prayers for me to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be delivered from the disobedient in Judea; and that my service, which I am performing for Jerusalem, may be acceptable to the saints:</verse>
