      <chapter osisID='Col.1'>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.1'>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, the brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to the saints and faithful brethren in Christ, who are at Colosse: Favor to you, and peace from God our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ always, when we pray for you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love which you have to all the saints-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>for the hope which is laid up for you in the heavens, of which you have formerly heard in the word of truth of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which is present among you, as it is also in the world, and is bringing forth fruit and prevailing, even as among you, from that day you heard and knew the favor of God in truth-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>even as you learned it of Epaphras, our beloved fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful minister of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>who has also declared to us your love in spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>For this reason, we also, from the day we heard these things, do not cease to pray for you, and to request that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>that you may walk worthy of the Lord to all pleasing, bringing forth fruit by every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>being strengthened with all strength, according to his glorious power, to all patience and long-suffering with joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us for a portion of the inheritance of the saints in the light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>who has delivered us from the power of darkness, and has translated us into the kingdom of his beloved Son:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>by whom we have redemption, even the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>He is the image of the invisible God, the first born of the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>Because, by him were created all things which are in the heavens, and which are upon the earth; things visible, and things invisible; whether thrones, or lordships, or governments, or powers; all things were created by him and for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>And he is before all things; and by him all things consist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And he is the head of the body, even the congregation. He is the beginning, the first born from the dead, that in all respects he might be pre-eminent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For it pleased the Father that all fullness should dwell in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and by him to reconcile all things to himself, having made peace by the blood of his cross; I say, by him, whether they be things on the earth, or things in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>Even you, who were formerly alienated in mind, and enemies by wicked works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>he has now, indeed, reconciled, by the body of his flesh, to present you holy and unblameable, and unreproveable, in his sight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if, indeed, you continue in the faith founded and stable, and not removed from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature which is under heaven; of which I, Paul, am made a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>I now rejoice in sufferings for you, and fill up the remainder of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh, for his body, which is the congregation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>of which I am made a minister, according to the dispensation of God, which was given to me on your account, fully to declare the word of God-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>the secret which had been kept hid from the ages, and from the generations, but now has been made manifest to his saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>to whom God has pleased to make known what is the riches of the glory of this secret among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>whom we announce, admonishing every man, and teaching every man, with all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>For which I also labor, combating vigorously, according to the effectual working of him who works effectually in me with power.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>Wherefore, I wish you to know how great a combat I have for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that being compacted together in love, their hearts may be comforted, even by all the riches of the full assurance of understanding, to the acknowledgment of the secret of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are laid up all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>Now this I say, that no one may deceive you with plausible speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though I am absent in the flesh, yet I am with you in the spirit, rejoicing and beholding your order, and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>Now as you have received Christ Jesus the Lord, walk in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>rooted and built up in him, and established in the faith, even as you have been taught, abounding in it with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Beware lest any one make a prey of you through an empty and deceitful philosophy, -according to the tradition of men, according to the elements of the world, and not according to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>For all the fullness of the Deity resides substantially in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>And you are complete in him, who is the head of all government and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>By whom, also, you have been circumcised with the circumcision made without hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>having been buried with him in immersion, by which also you have been raised with him, through the belief of the strong working of God, who raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>For you, who were dead on account of trespasses, and by the uncircumcision of your flesh, he had made alive together with him, having forgiven you all trespasses:-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>having blotted out the handwriting of the ordinances concerning us, which was contrary to us, he has taken it away, nailing it to the cross:-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>having spoiled governments and powers, he made a show of them openly, having triumphed over them by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let no one, therefore, judge you in meat, or in drink, or in respect of a festival, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of the things which were to come, but the substance is of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>Let no one beguile you of your reward, -delighting in humility, and the worship of messengers, intruding into things which he has not seen, being without cause, puffed up by his own carnal mind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding firmly the head, by whom the whole body, through the joints and ligaments, being served and compacted, increases with the increase of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>Now, if you have died with Christ from the elements of the world, why, as living in the world, you are subject to ordinances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>Touch not, taste not, handle not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>(which are all to perish with the using;) after the commandments and doctrines of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>which things have, indeed, a show of wisdom in will-worship, and humility, and not sparing the body-without any respect to the gratification of the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If, then, you have been raised with Christ seek the things which are above, where Christ sits at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Set your affections on things above; not on things upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For you are dead; but your life is hid with Christ in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>When Christ our life shall appear then you shall also appear with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Mortify, therefore, your members which are on the earth; fornication, impurity, passion, evil desire, and licentiousness, which is idolatry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>for which the wrath of God comes on the children of disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>in which you also formerly walked, when you lived with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now also put away all these, anger, wrath, malice, defamation, obscene discourse, from your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Lie not one to another, having put off the old man, with his practices;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and having put on the new, who is renewed by knowledge, after the image of him, who created him;-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there is neither Greek nor Jew; circumcision nor uncircumcision; barbarian, Scythian; bond nor free; but Christ is all, and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Put on, therefore, as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of compassion, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, long-suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>Bear with one another, and forgive each other, if any one have a complaint against any one: even as Christ forgave you, so also do you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>And over all these put on love, which is a bond of perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let the peace of God rule in your hearts; to which also you are called in one body, and be thankful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly; and with all wisdom teach and admonish each other by psalms and hymns, and spiritual songs; singing with gratitude in your hearts to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatever you do, in word or in deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God, even the Father, through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as it is fit in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Husbands, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in all things, for this is well pleasing to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, do not exasperate your children, lest they be discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Servants, obey in all things your masters according to the flesh; not with eye-service, as men-pleasers, but with integrity of heart, as fearing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And whatever you do, work it from the soul, as to the Lord, and not to men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>knowing that from the Lord you shall receive the recompense for the inheritance; for you serve the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>But he who does unjustly, shall receive for the injustice, he has done: for there is no respect of persons.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, afford to your servants what is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>Continue instant in prayer, watching in it with thanksgiving;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>at the same time, also, praying for us, that God would open to us a door of utterance, to speak the secret of Christ, for which, indeed, I am in bonds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>that I may make it manifest, as I ought to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>Walk in wisdom toward them who are without, gaining time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>Let your speech be always with gracefulness, seasoned with salt, knowing how you ought to answer every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>All things concerning me, Tychicus, a beloved brother, and faithful minister, and fellow-servant in the Lord, will make known to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>whom I have sent to you for this very purpose, that he may know your affairs, and comfort your hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>with Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, who is from you. They will make known to you all things which are done here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchus, my fellow-prisoner, salutes you; and Mark, the nephew of Barnabas, concerning whom you go orders: if he come to you, receive him-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and Jesus, who is called Justus, who are of the circumcision. These, alone, are laborers with me for the kingdom of God, who has been a consolation to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphras, who came from you, a servant of Christ, salutes you; at all times fervently striving for you by prayers, that you may stand perfect and complete in the whole will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.13'>For I bear him witness, that he has much affection for you, and for them in Laodicea, and for them in Hierapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.14'>Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas, salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.15'>Salute the brethren in Laodicea; and Nymphas, and the congregation in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.16'>And when this epistle has been read to you, cause that it be read also in the congregation of the Laodiceans; and that you also read the one from Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.17'>And say to Archippus, Take heed to the ministry, which you have received in the Lord, that you may fulfill it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.18'>The salutation of Paul, with my own hand. Remember my bonds. Favor be with you.</verse>
