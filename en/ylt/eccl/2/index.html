I prepared for me  men-singers and women-singers, and the luxuries of the sons of  man -- a wife and wives.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I became great, and increased above every one who had  been before me in Jerusalem; also, my wisdom stood with me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And all that mine eyes asked I kept not back from them; I  withheld not my heart from any joy, for my heart rejoiced  because of all my labour, and this hath been my portion, from  all my labour,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and I have looked on all my works that my hands have done,  and on the labour that I have laboured to do, and lo, the whole  [is] vanity and vexation of spirit, and there is no advantage  under the sun!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I turned to see wisdom, and madness, and folly, but  what [is] the man who cometh after the king? that which [is]  already -- they have done it!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And I saw that there is an advantage to wisdom  above  folly, like the advantage of the light above  the darkness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The wise! -- his eyes [are] in his head, and the fool in  darkness is walking, and I also knew that one event happeneth  with them all;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and I said in my heart, `As it happeneth with the fool, it  happeneth also with me, and why am I then more wise?` And I  spake in my heart, that also this [is] vanity:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>That there is no remembrance to the wise -- with the fool  -- to the age, for that which [is] already, [in] the days that  are coming is all forgotten, and how dieth the wise? with the  fool!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And I have hated life, for sad to me [is] the work that  hath been done under the sun, for the whole [is] vanity and  vexation of spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And I have hated all my labour that I  labour at under the  sun, because I leave it to a man who is after me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And who knoweth whether he is wise or foolish? yet he doth  rule over all my labour that I have laboured at, and that I  have done wisely under  the sun! this also [is] vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I turned round to cause my heart to despair concerning  all the labour that I laboured at under the sun.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For there is a man whose labour [is] in wisdom, and in  knowledge, and in equity, and to a man who hath not laboured  therein he giveth it -- his portion! Even this [is] vanity and  a great evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For what hath been to a man by all his labour, and by the  thought of his heart that he laboured at under the sun?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>For all his days are sorrows, and his travail sadness; even  at night his heart hath not lain down; this also [is] vanity.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>There is nothing good in a man who eateth, and hath drunk,  and hath shewn his soul good in his labour. This also I have  seen that it [is] from the hand of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For who eateth and who hasteth out more than I?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For to a man who [is] good before Him, He hath  given  wisdom, and knowledge, and joy; and to a sinner He hath given  travail, to gather and to heap up, to give to the good before  God. Even this [is] vanity and vexation of spirit.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
