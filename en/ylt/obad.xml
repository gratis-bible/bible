      <chapter osisID='Obad.1'>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.1'>Thus said the Lord Jehovah to Edom, A report we have heard  from Jehovah, And an ambassador among nations was sent, `Rise,  yea, let us rise against her for battle.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.2'>Lo, little I have made thee among nations, Despised [art]  thou exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.3'>The pride of thy heart hath lifted thee up, O dweller in  clifts of a rock, (A high place [is] his habitation, He is  saying in his heart, `Who doth bring me down [to] earth?`)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.4'>If thou dost go up high as an eagle, And if between stars  thou dost set thy nest, From thence I bring thee down, An  affirmation of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.5'>If thieves have come in to thee, If spoilers of the night,  How hast thou been cut off! Do they not steal their  sufficiency? If gatherers have come in to thee, Do they not  leave gleanings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.6'>How hath Esau been searched out! Flowed out have his hidden  things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.7'>Unto the border sent thee have all thine allies, Forgotten  thee, prevailed over thee, have thy friends, Thy bread they  make a snare under thee, There is no understanding in him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.8'>Is it not in that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah, That I  have destroyed the wise out of Edom, And understanding out of  the mount of Esau?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.9'>And broken down have been thy mighty ones, O Teman, So that  every one of the mount of Esau is cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.10'>For slaughter, for violence [to] thy brother Jacob, Cover  thee doth shame, And thou hast been cut off -- to the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.11'>In the day of thy standing over-against, In the day of  strangers taking captive his force, And foreigners have entered  his gates, And for Jerusalem have cast a lot, Even thou [art]  as one of them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.12'>And -- thou dost not look on the day of thy brother, On the  day of his alienation, Nor dost thou rejoice over sons of  Judah, In the day of their destruction, Nor make great thy  mouth in a day of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.13'>Nor come into a gate of My people in a day of their  calamity, Nor look, even thou, on its misfortune in a day of  its calamity, Nor send forth against its force in a day of its  calamity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.14'>Nor stand by the breach to cut off its escaped, Nor deliver  up its remnant in a day of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.15'>For near [is] the day of Jehovah, on all the nations, As  thou hast done, it is done to thee, Thy deed doth turn back on  thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.16'>For -- as ye have drunk on My holy mount, Drink do all the  nations continually, And they have drunk and have swallowed,  And they have been as they have not been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.17'>And in mount Zion there is an escape, And it hath been  holy, And the house of Jacob have possessed their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.18'>And the house of Jacob hath been a fire, And the house of  Joseph a flame, And the house of Esau for stubble, And they  have burned among them, And they have consumed them, And there  is not a remnant to the house of Esau, For Jehovah hath spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.19'>And they have possessed the south with the mount of Esau,  And the low country with the Philistines, And they have  possessed the field of Ephraim, And the field of Samaria, And  Benjamin with Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.20'>And the removed of this force of the sons of Israel, That  [is with] the Canaanites unto Zarephat, And the removed of  Jerusalem that [is] with the Sepharad, Possess the cities of  the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Obad.1.21'>And gone up have saviours on mount Zion, To judge the mount  of Esau, And the kingdom hath been to Jehovah!`</verse>
