from the heavens, from the settled  place of Thy dwelling, and hast done according to all that the  stranger calleth unto Thee for: so that all the peoples of the  earth do know Thy name, so as to fear Thee, as Thy people  Israel, and to know that Thy name is called on this house that  I have built.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>`When Thy people doth go out to battle against its enemies  in the way that Thou dost send them, and they have prayed unto  Thee the way of this city that Thou hast fixed on, and the  house that I have built for Thy name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>then Thou hast heard from the heavens their prayer and  their supplication, and hast maintained their cause.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>`When they sin against Thee -- for there is not a man who  sinneth not -- and Thou hast been angry with them, and hast  given them before an enemy, and taken them captive have their  captors, unto a land far off or near;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and they have turned [it] back unto their heart in the land  whither they have been taken captive, and have turned back, and  made supplication unto Thee in the land of their captivity,  saying, We have sinned, we have done perversely, and have done  wickedly;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>yea, they have turned back unto Thee with all their heart,  and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity,  whither they have taken them captive, and they have prayed the  way of their land that Thou hast given to their fathers, and of  the city that Thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have  built for Thy name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>then Thou hast heard from the heavens, from the settled  place of Thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications,  and hast maintained their cause, and forgiven Thy people who  have sinned against Thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>`Now, my God, let, I beseech Thee, Thine eyes be open, and  Thine ears attentive, to the prayer of this place:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>and now, rise, O Jehovah God, to Thy rest, Thou, and the  ark of Thy strength; Thy priests, O Jehovah God, are clothed  with salvation, and Thy saints rejoice in the goodness,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>O Jehovah God, turn not back the face of Thine anointed, be  mindful of the kind acts of David Thy servant.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
