only, one  thing I am asking of thee, that is, Thou dost not see my face,  except thou dost first bring in Michal, daughter of Saul in thy  coming into see my face.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And David sendeth messengers unto Ish-Bosheth son of Saul,  saying, `Give up my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself  with a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Ish-Bosheth sendeth, and taketh her from a man, from  Phaltiel son of Laish,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and her husband goeth with her, going on and weeping behind  her, unto Bahurim, and Abner saith unto him, `Go, turn back;`  and he turneth back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the word of Abner was with the elders of Israel,  saying, `Heretofore ye have been seeking David for king over  you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and now, do [it], for Jehovah hath spoken of David saying,  By the hand of David my servant -- to save My people Israel out  of the hand of the Philistines, and out of the hand of all  their enemies.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Abner speaketh also in the ears of Benjamin, and Abner  goeth also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that  [is] good in the eyes of Israel, and in the eyes of all the  house of Benjamin,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and Abner cometh in unto David, to Hebron, and with him  twenty men, and David maketh for Abner, and for the men who  [are] with him, a banquet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Abner saith unto David, `I arise, and go, and gather  unto my lord the king the whole of Israel, and they make with  thee a covenant, and thou hast reigned over all that thy soul  desireth;` and David sendeth away Abner, and he goeth in peace.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And lo, the servants of David, and Joab, have come from the  troop, and much spoil have brought with them, and Abner is not  with David in Hebron, for he hath sent him away, and he goeth  in peace;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and Joab and all the host that [is] with him have come, and  they declare to Joab, saying, `Abner son of Ner hath come unto  the king, and he sendeth him away, and he goeth in peace.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And Joab cometh unto the king, and saith, `What hast thou  done? lo, Abner hath come unto thee! why [is] this -- thou hast  sent him away, and he is really gone?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Thou hast known Abner son of Ner, that to deceive thee he  came, and to know thy going out and thy coming in, and to know all  that thou art doing.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joab goeth out from David, and sendeth messengers after  Abner, and they bring him back from the well of Sirah, and  David knew not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Abner turneth back to Hebron, and Joab turneth him  aside unto the midst of the gate to speak with him quietly, and  smiteth him there in the fifth [rib] -- and he dieth -- for the  blood of Asahel his brother.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And David heareth afterwards and saith, `Acquitted [am] I,  and my kingdom, by Jehovah, unto the age, from the blood of  Abner son of Ner;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>it doth stay on the head of Joab, and on all the house of  his father, and there is not cut off from the house of Joab one  having an issue, and leprous, and laying hold on a staff, and  falling by a sword, and lacking bread.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And Joab and Abishai his brother slew Abner because that he  put to death Asahel their brother, in Gibeon, in battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And David saith unto Joab, and unto all the people who  [are] with him, `Rend your garments, and gird on sackcloth, and  mourn before Abner;` and king David is going after the bier.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And they bury Abner in Hebron, and the king lifteth up his  voice, and weepeth at the grave of Abner, and all the people  weep;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the king lamenteth for Abner, and saith: -- `As the  death of a fool doth Abner die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>Thy hands not bound, And thy feet to fetters not brought  nigh! As one falling before sons of evil -- Thou hast fallen!`  and all the people add to weep over him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And all the people come to cause David to eat bread while  yet day, and David sweareth, saying, `Thus doth God to me, and  thus He doth add, for -- before the going in of the sun, I  taste no bread or any other thing.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>And all the people have discerned [it], and it is good in  their eyes, as all that the king hath done is good in the eyes  of all the people;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and all the people know, even all Israel, in that day, that  it hath not been from the king -- to put to death Abner son of  Ner.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And the king saith unto his servants, `Do ye not know that  a prince and a great one hath fallen this day in Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>and I to-day [am] tender, and an anointed king: and these  men, sons of Zeruiah, [are] too hard for me; Jehovah doth  recompense to the doer of the evil according to his evil.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
