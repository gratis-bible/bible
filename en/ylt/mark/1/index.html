thou didst come to destroy us; I have known thee who  thou art -- the Holy One of God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, `Be silenced, and come forth  out of him,`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>and the unclean spirit having torn him, and having cried  with a great voice, came forth out of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and they were all amazed, so as to reason among themselves,  saying, `What is this? what new teaching [is] this? that with  authority also the unclean spirits he commandeth, and they obey  him!`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And the fame of him went forth immediately to all the  region, round about, of Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And immediately, having come forth out of the synagogue,  they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and  John,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and the mother-in-law of Simon was lying fevered, and  immediately they tell him about her,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>and having come near, he raised her up, having laid hold of  her hand, and the fever left her immediately, and she was  ministering to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And evening having come, when the sun did set, they brought  unto him all who were ill, and who were demoniacs,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>and the whole city was gathered together near the door,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and he healed many who were ill of manifold diseases, and  many demons he cast forth, and was not suffering the demons to  speak, because they knew him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And very early, it being yet night, having risen, he went  forth, and went away to a desert place, and was there praying;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>and Simon and those with him went in quest of him,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>and having found him, they say to him, -- `All do seek  thee;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>and he saith to them, `We may go to the next towns, that  there also I may preach, for for this I came forth.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And he was preaching in their synagogues, in all Galilee,  and is casting out the demons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>and there doth come to him a leper, calling on him, and  kneeling to him, and saying to him -- `If thou mayest will,  thou art able to cleanse me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And Jesus having been moved with compassion, having  stretched forth the hand, touched him, and saith to him, `I  will; be thou cleansed;`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>and he having spoken, immediately the leprosy went away  from him, and he was cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>And having sternly charged him, immediately he put him  forth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>and saith to him, `See thou mayest say nothing to any one,  but go away, thyself shew to the priest, and bring near for thy  cleansing the things Moses directed, for a testimony to them.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>And he, having gone forth, began to proclaim much, and to  spread abroad the thing, so that no more he was able openly to  enter into the city, but he was without in desert places, and  they were coming unto him from every quarter.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
