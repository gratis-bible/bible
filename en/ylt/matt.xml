        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of  Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begat Isaac, and Isaac begat Jacob, and Jacob begat  Judah and his brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah begat Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez begat  Hezron, and Hezron begat Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Ram begat Amminadab, and Amminadab begat Nahshon, and  Nahshon begat Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon begat Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz begat Obed of Ruth,  and Obed begat Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse begat David the king. And David the king begat  Solomon, of her [who had been] Uriah`s,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon begat Rehoboam, and Rehoboam begat Abijah, and  Abijah begat Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa begat Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat begat Joram, and  Joram begat Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzziah begat Jotham, and Jotham begat Ahaz, and Ahaz  begat Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Hezekiah begat Manasseh, and Manasseh begat Amon, and  Amon begat Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josiah begat Jeconiah and his brethren, at the  Babylonian removal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah begat Shealtiel,  and Shealtiel begat Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zerubbabel begat Abiud, and Abiud begat Eliakim, and  Eliakim begat Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor begat Sadok, and Sadok begat Achim, and Achim  begat Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eliud begat Eleazar, and Eleazar begat Matthan, and  Matthan begat Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was  begotten Jesus, who is named Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David  [are] fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian  removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal  unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother  Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming  together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to  make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the  Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, `Joseph, son of David,  thou mayest not fear to receive Mary thy wife, for that which  in her was begotten [is] of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>and she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his  name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>And all this hath come to pass, that it may be fulfilled  that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>`Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a  son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,` which is, being  interpreted `With us [he is] God.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the  messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the  first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the  days of Herod the king, lo, mages from the east came to  Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, `Where is he who was born king of the Jews? for we  saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all  Jerusalem with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the  people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, `In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it  hath been written through the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And thou, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, thou art by no  means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of thee  shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire  exactly from them the time of the appearing star,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, `Having gone --  inquire ye exactly for the child, and whenever ye may have  found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to  him.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star,  that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having  come, it stood over where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding  great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>and having come to the house, they found the child with  Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and  having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts,  gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back  unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own  region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And on their having withdrawn, lo, a messenger of the Lord  doth appear in a dream to Joseph, saying, `Having risen, take  the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be thou there  till I may speak to thee, for Herod is about to seek the child  to destroy him.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And he, having risen, took the child and his mother by  night, and withdrew to Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and he was there till the death of Herod, that it might be  fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet,  saying, `Out of Egypt I did call My Son.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the mages,  was very wroth, and having sent forth, he slew all the male  children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years  and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from  the mages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the  prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>`A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and  much mourning -- Rachel weeping [for] her children, and she  would not be comforted because they are not.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>And Herod having died, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a  dream doth appear to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, `Having risen, take the child and his mother, and  be going to the land of Israel, for they have died -- those  seeking the life of the child.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he, having risen, took the child and his mother, and  came to the land of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>and having heard that Archelaus doth reign over Judea  instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go thither, and  having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the  parts of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it  might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that  `A Nazarene he shall be called.`</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>And in those days cometh John the Baptist, proclaiming in  the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, `Reform, for come nigh hath the reign of the  heavens,`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet,  saying, `A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye  the way of the Lord, straight make ye His paths.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And this John had his clothing of camel`s hair, and a girdle  of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and  honey of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and  all the region round about the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing  their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming  about his baptism, he said to them, `Brood of vipers! who did  shew you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have --  Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones  to raise children to Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid,  every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and  to fire is cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>`I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he  who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not  worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy  Spirit and with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse  his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the  chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then cometh Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John  to be baptized by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>but John was forbidding him, saying, `I have need by thee  to be baptized -- and thou dost come unto me!`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answering said to him, `Suffer now, for thus it  is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,` then he doth  suffer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from  the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw  the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, `This is My Son  -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.`</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be  tempted by the Devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he  did hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the Tempter having come to him said, `If Son thou art of  God -- speak that these stones may become loaves.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answering said, `It hath been written, Not upon bread  alone doth man live, but upon every word coming forth from the  mouth of God.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then doth the Devil take him to the [holy] city, and doth  set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and saith to him, `If Son thou art of God -- cast thyself  down, for it hath been written, that, His messengers He shall  charge concerning thee, and on hands they shall bear thee up,  that thou mayest not dash on a stone thy foot.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him again, `It hath been written, Thou shalt  not tempt the Lord thy God.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again doth the Devil take him to a very high mount, and doth  shew to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of  them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and saith to him, `All these to thee I will give, if falling  down thou mayest bow to me.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then saith Jesus to him, `Go -- Adversary, for it hath been  written, The Lord thy God thou shalt bow to, and Him only thou  shalt serve.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then doth the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and  were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did  withdraw to Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at  Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and  Naphtalim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah  the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>`Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea,  beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light,  and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light  arose to them.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, `Reform  ye, for come nigh hath the reign of the heavens.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers,  Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into  the sea -- for they were fishers --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>and he saith to them, `Come ye after me, and I will make  you fishers of men,`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow  him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And having advanced thence, he saw other two brothers,  James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with  Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and they, immediately, having left the boat and their  father, did follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their  synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and  healing every disease, and every malady among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to  him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and  pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he  healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and  Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and  he having sat down, his disciples came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>`Happy the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of  the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>`Happy the mourning -- because they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>`Happy the meek -- because they shall inherit the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>`Happy those hungering and thirsting for righteousness --  because they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>`Happy the kind -- because they shall find kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>`Happy the clean in heart -- because they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>`Happy the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons  of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>`Happy those persecuted for righteousness` sake -- because  theirs is the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>`Happy are ye whenever they may reproach you, and may  persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for  my sake --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>rejoice ye and be glad, because your reward [is] great in  the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were  before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>`Ye are the salt of the land, but if the salt may lose  savour, in what shall it be salted? for nothing is it good  henceforth, except to be cast without, and to be trodden down  by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>`Ye are the light of the world, a city set upon a mount is  not able to be hid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but  on the lamp-stand, and it shineth to all those in the house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>so let your light shine before men, that they may see your  good works, and may glorify your Father who [is] in the  heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>`Do not suppose that I came to throw down the law or the  prophets -- I did not come to throw down, but to fulfill;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the  earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle may not pass away  from the law, till that all may come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>`Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the  least -- and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the  reign of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach [them],  he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>`For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not  abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, ye may not  enter to the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>`Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not  kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>but I -- I say to you, that every one who is angry at his  brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and  whoever may say to his brother, Empty fellow! shall be in  danger of the sanhedrim, and whoever may say, Rebel! shall be  in danger of the gehenna of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>`If, therefore, thou mayest bring thy gift to the altar,  and there mayest remember that thy brother hath anything  against thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there thy gift before the altar, and go -- first be  reconciled to thy brother, and then having come bring thy gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>`Be agreeing with thy opponent quickly, while thou art in  the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver thee to the  judge, and the judge may deliver thee to the officer, and to  prison thou mayest be cast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>verily I say to thee, thou mayest not come forth thence  till that thou mayest pay the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>`Ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou shalt not  commit adultery;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>but I -- I say to you, that every one who is looking on a  woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in  his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>`But, if thy right eye doth cause thee to stumble, pluck it  out and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy  members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>`And, if thy right hand doth cause thee to stumble, cut it  off, and cast from thee, for it is good to thee that one of thy  members may perish, and not thy whole body be cast to gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>`And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let  him give to her a writing of divorce;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>but I -- I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife,  save for the matter of whoredom, doth make her to commit  adultery; and whoever may marry her who hath been put away doth  commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>`Again, ye heard that it was said to the ancients: Thou  shalt not swear falsely, but thou shalt pay to the Lord thine  oaths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>but I -- I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the  heaven, because it is the throne of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by  Jerusalem, because it is a city of a great king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>nor by thy head mayest thou swear, because thou art not  able one hair to make white or black;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>but let your word be, Yes, Yes, No, No, and that which is  more than these is of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>`Ye heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for  tooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>but I -- I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever  shall slap thee on thy right cheek, turn to him also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>and whoever is willing to take thee to law, and thy coat to  take -- suffer to him also the cloak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Another simile spake he to them: `The reign of the heavens  is like to leaven, which a woman having taken, hid in three  measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.`</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>`As, then, the darnel is gathered up, and is burned with  fire, so shall it be in the full end of this age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>the Son of Man shall send forth his messengers, and they  shall gather up out of his kingdom all the stumbling-blocks,  and those doing the unlawlessness,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.49'>so shall it be in the full end of the age, the messengers  shall come forth and separate the evil out of the midst of the  righteous,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.1'>`Then shall the reign of the heavens be likened to ten  virgins, who, having taken their lamps, went forth to meet the  bridegroom;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.3'>they who were foolish having taken their lamps, did not  take with themselves oil;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>And Pilate having seen that it profiteth nothing, but  rather a tumult is made, having taken water, he did wash the  hands before the multitude, saying, `I am innocent from the  blood of this righteous one; ye -- ye shall see;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>and all the people answering said, `His blood [is] upon  us, and upon our children!`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then did he release to them Barabbas, and having scourged  Jesus, he delivered [him] up that he may be crucified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>then the soldiers of the governor having taken Jesus to  the Praetorium, did gather to him all the band;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>and having unclothed him, they put around him a crimson  cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>and having plaited him a crown out of thorns they put [it]  on his head, and a reed in his right hand, and having kneeled  before him, they were mocking him, saying, `Hail, the king of  the Jews.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And having spit on him, they took the reed, and were  smiting on his head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>and when they had mocked him, they took off from him the  cloak, and put on him his own garments, and led him away to  crucify [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And coming forth, they found a man, a Cyrenian, by name  Simon: him they impressed that he might bear his cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>and having come to a place called Golgotha, that is called  Place of a Skull,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave him to drink vinegar mixed with gall, and having  tasted, he would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And having crucified him, they divided his garments,  casting a lot, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by  the prophet, `They divided my garments to themselves, and over  my vesture they cast a lot;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>and sitting down, they were watching him there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>and they put up over his head, his accusation written,  `This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then crucified with him are two robbers, one on the right  hand, and one on the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>and those passing by were speaking evil of him, wagging  their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, `Thou that art throwing down the sanctuary,  and in three days building [it], save thyself; if Son thou art  of God, come down from the cross.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>And in like manner also the chief priests mocking, with  the scribes and elders, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>`Others he saved; himself he is not able to save! If he be  King of Israel, let him come down now from the cross, and we  will believe him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>he hath trusted on God, let Him now deliver him, if He  wish him, because he said -- Son of God I am;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>with the same also the robbers, who were crucified with  him, were reproaching him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>And from the sixth hour darkness came over all the land  unto the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>and about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a great  voice, saying, `Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?` that is, `My God,  my God, why didst Thou forsake me?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>And certain of those standing there having heard, said --  `Elijah he doth call;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>and immediately, one of them having run, and having taken  a spunge, having filled [it] with vinegar, and having put [it]  on a reed, was giving him to drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>but the rest said, `Let alone, let us see if Elijah doth  come -- about to save him.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus having again cried with a great voice, yielded  the spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>and lo, the vail of the sanctuary was rent in two from top  unto bottom, and the earth did quake, and the rocks were rent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints  who have fallen asleep, arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and having come forth out of the tombs after his rising,  they went into the holy city, and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>And the centurion, and those with him watching Jesus,  having seen the earthquake, and the things that were done, were  exceedingly afraid, saying, `Truly this was God`s Son.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And there were there many women beholding from afar, who  did follow Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom was Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of  James and of Joses, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>And evening having come, there came a rich man, from  Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was discipled to  Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>he having gone near to Pilate, asked for himself the body  of Jesus; then Pilate commanded the body to be given back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And having taken the body, Joseph wrapped it in clean  linen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his new tomb, that he hewed in the rock,  and having rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, he  went away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>and there were there Mary the Magdalene, and the other  Mary, sitting over-against the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>And on the morrow that is after the preparation, were  gathered together the chief priests, and the Pharisees, unto  Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, `Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said  while yet living, After three days I do rise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the  third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal  him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and  the last deceit shall be worse than the first.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>And Pilate said to them, `Ye have a watch, go away, make  secure -- as ye have known;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>and they, having gone, did make the sepulchre secure,  having sealed the stone, together with the watch.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>And on the eve of the sabbaths, at the dawn, toward the  first of the sabbaths, came Mary the Magdalene, and the other  Mary, to see the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>and lo, there came a great earthquake, for a messenger of  the Lord, having come down out of heaven, having come, did roll  away the stone from the door, and was sitting upon it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>and his countenance was as lightning, and his clothing  white as snow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>and from the fear of him did the keepers shake, and they  became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the messenger answering said to the women, `Fear not  ye, for I have known that Jesus, who hath been crucified, ye  seek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>he is not here, for he rose, as he said; come, see the  place where the Lord was lying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>and having gone quickly, say ye to his disciples, that he  rose from the dead; and lo, he doth go before you to Galilee,  there ye shall see him; lo, I have told you.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And having gone forth quickly from the tomb, with fear and  great joy, they ran to tell to his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>and as they were going to tell to his disciples, then lo,  Jesus met them, saying, `Hail!` and they having come near, laid  hold of his feet, and did bow to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then saith Jesus to them, `Fear ye not, go away, tell to  my brethren that they may go away to Galilee, and there they  shall see me.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>And while they are going on, lo, certain of the watch  having come to the city, told to the chief priests all the  things that happened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>and having been gathered together with the elders, counsel  also having taken, they gave much money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>saying, `Say ye, that his disciples having come by night,  stole him -- we being asleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>and if this be heard by the governor, we will persuade  him, and you keep free from anxiety.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>And they, having received the money, did as they were  taught, and this account was spread abroad among Jews till this  day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>And the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mount  where Jesus appointed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>and having seen him, they bowed to him, but some did  waver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And having come near, Jesus spake to them, saying, `Given  to me was all authority in heaven and on earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>having gone, then, disciple all the nations, (baptizing  them -- to the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the  Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all, whatever I did command you,)  and lo, I am with you all the days -- till the full end of the  age.`</verse>
