and those who  [are] from the city are destroying them in their midst;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>they have compassed the Benjamites -- they have pursued them  -- with ease they have trodden them down till over-against Gibeah,  at the sun-rising.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And there fall of Benjamin eighteen thousand men -- the  whole of these [are] men of valour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>and they turn and flee toward the wilderness, unto the  rock of Rimmon; and they glean of them in the highways five  thousand men, and follow after them unto Gidom, and smite of  them two thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>And all those falling of Benjamin are twenty and five  thousand men drawing sword, on that day -- the whole of these  [are] men of valour;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>and there turn and flee into the wilderness, unto the rock  of Rimmon six hundred men, and they dwell in the rock Rimmon  four months.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And the men of Israel have turned back unto the sons of  Benjamin, and smite them by the mouth of the sword out of the  city, -- men unto cattle, unto all that is found; also all the  cities which are found they have sent into fire.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
