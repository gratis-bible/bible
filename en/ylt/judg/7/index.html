bring them down unto the water, and I refine it for thee  there; and it hath been, he of whom I say unto thee, This doth  go with thee -- he doth go with thee; and any of whom I say  unto thee, This doth not go with thee -- he doth not go.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And he bringeth down the people unto the water, and Jehovah  saith unto Gideon, `Every one who lappeth with his tongue of  the water as the dog lappeth -- thou dost set him apart; also  every one who boweth on his knees to drink.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And the number of those lapping with their hand unto their  mouth is three hundred men, and all the rest of the people have  bowed down on their knees to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `By the three hundred men who  are lapping I save you, and have given Midian into thy hand,  and all the people go, each to his place.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the people take the provision in their hand, and their  trumpets, and every man of Israel he hath sent away, each to  his tents; and on the three hundred men he hath kept hold, and  the camp of Midian hath been by him at the lower part of the  valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And it cometh to pass, on that night, that Jehovah saith  unto him, `Rise, go down into the camp, for I have given it  into thy hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and if thou art afraid to go down -- go down, thou and Phurah  thy young man, unto the camp,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and thou hast heard what they speak, and afterwards are thy  hands strengthened, and thou hast gone down against the camp.`  And he goeth down, he and Phurah his young man, unto the  extremity of the fifties who [are] in the camp;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and Midian and Amalek, and all the sons of the east are  lying in the valley, as the locust for multitude, and of their  camels there is no number, as sand which [is] on the sea-shore  for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And Gideon cometh in, and lo, a man is recounting to his  companion a dream, and saith, `Lo, a dream I have dreamed, and  lo, a cake of barley-bread is turning itself over into the camp  of Midian, and it cometh in unto the tent, and smiteth it, and  it falleth, and turneth it upwards, and the tent hath fallen.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And his companion answereth and saith, `This is nothing  save the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; God  hath given into his hand Midian and all the camp.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And it cometh to pass, when Gideon heareth the narration of  the dream and its interpretation, that he boweth himself, and  turneth back unto the camp of Israel, and saith, `Rise ye, for  Jehovah hath given into your hand the camp of Midian.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he divideth the three hundred men [into] three  detachments, and putteth trumpets into the hand of all of them,  and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And he saith unto them, `Look at me, and thus do; and lo, I  am coming into the extremity of the camp -- and it hath been -- as  I do so ye do;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and I have blown with a trumpet -- I and all who [are] with  me, and ye have blown with trumpets, even ye, round about all  the camp, and have said, For Jehovah and for Gideon.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Gideon cometh -- and the hundred men who [are] with  him -- into the extremity of the camp, [at] the beginning of the  middle watch (it hath only just confirmed the watchmen), and  they blow with trumpets -- dashing in pieces also the pitchers  which [are] in their hand;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>and the three detachments blow with trumpets, and break the  pitchers, and keep hold with their left hand on the lamps, and  with their right hand on the trumpets to blow, and they cry,  `The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they stand each in his place, round about the camp, and  all the camp runneth, and they shout, and flee;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and the three hundred blow the trumpets, and Jehovah  setteth the sword of each against his companion, even through  all the camp; and the camp fleeth unto Beth-Shittah, at  Zererath, unto the border of Abel-Meholah, by Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the men of Israel are called from Naphtali, and from  Asher, and from all Manasseh, and pursue after Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And messengers hath sent Gideon into all the hill-country  of Ephraim, saying, `Come down to meet Midian, and capture  before them the waters unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan;` and  every man of Ephraim is called, and they capture the waters  unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and they capture two of the heads of Midian, Oreb, and  Zeeb, and slay Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they have  slain at the wine-vat of Zeeb, and they pursue unto Midian; and  the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they have brought in unto Gideon  beyond the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
