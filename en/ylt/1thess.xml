  <div osisID='1Thess' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Silvanus, and Timotheus, to the assembly of  Thessalonians in God  the Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ:  Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father, and the Lord  Jesus Christ!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God always for you all, making mention of  you in our  prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith, and  the labour of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of our  Lord Jesus Christ, in the  presence of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>having known, brethren beloved, by God, your election,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>because our good news did not come to you in word only, but  also in power,  and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance,  even as ye have known of what  sort we became among you because  of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>and ye -- ye did become imitators of us, and of the Lord,  having received  the word in much tribulation, with joy of the  Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>so that ye became patterns to all those believing in  Macedonia and Achaia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>for from you hath sounded forth the word of the Lord, not  only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place your  faith toward God did go forth, so  that we have no need to say  anything,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>for they themselves concerning us do declare what entrance  we had unto you,  and how ye did turn unto God from the idols,  to serve a living and true God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for His Son from the heavens, whom He did raise  out of the  dead -- Jesus, who is rescuing us from the anger  that is coming.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves have known, brethren, our entrance in unto  you, that it did  not become vain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but having both suffered before, and having been injuriously  treated (as ye  have known) in Philippi, we were bold in our  God to speak unto you the good  news of God in much conflict,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>for our exhortation [is] not out of deceit, nor out of  uncleanness, nor in  guile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the  good news, so  we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who is  proving our hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>for at no time did we come with speech of flattery, (as ye  have known,) nor  in a pretext for covetousness, (God [is]  witness!)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>nor seeking of men glory, neither from you nor from others,  being able to  be burdensome, as Christ`s apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we became gentle in your midst, as a nurse may cherish  her own  children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>so being desirous of you, we are well-pleased to impart to  you not only the  good news of God, but also our own souls,  because beloved ye have become to  us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>for ye remember, brethren, our labour and travail, for,  night and day  working not to be a burden upon any of you, we  did preach to you the good  news of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>ye [are] witnesses -- God also -- how kindly and  righteously, and  blamelessly to you who believe we became,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>even as ye have known, how each one of you, as a father his  own children,  we are exhorting you, and comforting, and  testifying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>for your walking worthily of God, who is calling you to His  own reign and  glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>Because of this also, we -- we do give thanks to God  continually, that,  having received the word of hearing from us  of God, ye accepted, not the word  of man, but as it is truly,  the word of God, who also doth work in you who  believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>for ye became imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God  that are in  Judea in Christ Jesus, because such things ye  suffered, even ye, from your  own countrymen, as also they from  the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who did both put to death the Lord Jesus and their own  prophets, and did  persecute us, and God they are not pleasing,  and to all men [are] contrary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us to speak to the nations that they might be  saved, to fill up  their sins always, but the anger did come  upon them -- to the end!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>And we, brethren, having been taken from you for the space  of an hour --  in presence, not in heart -- did hasten the more  abundantly to see your face  in much desire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>wherefore we wished to come unto you, (I indeed Paul,) both  once and  again, and the Adversary did hinder us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>for what [is] our hope, or joy, or crown of rejoicing? are  not even ye  before our Lord Jesus Christ in his presence?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>for ye are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Wherefore no longer forbearing, we thought good to be left  in Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and did send Timotheus -- our brother, and a ministrant of  God, and our  fellow-workman in the good news of the Christ --  to establish you, and to comfort you concerning your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one be moved in these tribulations, for yourselves  have known that  for this we are set,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>for even when we were with you, we said to you beforehand,  that we are  about to suffer tribulation, as also it did come  to pass, and ye have known  [it];</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>because of this also, I, no longer forbearing, did send to  know your faith,  lest he who is tempting did tempt you, and in  vain might be our labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>And now Timotheus having come unto us from you, and having  declared good  news to us of your faith and love, and that ye  have a good remembrance of us  always, desiring much to see us,  as we also [to see] you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>because of this we were comforted, brethren, over you, in  all our  tribulation and necessity, through your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>because now we live, if ye may stand fast in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>for what thanks are we able to recompense to God for you,  for all the joy with which we do joy because of you in the  presence of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day exceedingly beseeching, that we might see  your face, and perfect the things lacking in your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>And our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ,  direct our way unto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and you the Lord cause to increase and to abound in the  love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>to the establishing your hearts blameless in sanctification  before our God and Father, in the presence of our Lord Jesus  Christ with all His saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>As to the rest, then, brethren, we request you, and call  upon you in the Lord Jesus, as ye did receive from us how it  behoveth you to walk and to please God, that ye may abound the  more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>for ye have known what commands we gave you through the Lord  Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>for this is the will of God -- your sanctification; that ye  abstain from the whoredom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each of you know his own vessel to possess in  sanctification and honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in the affection of desire, as also the nations that  were not knowing God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that no one go beyond and defraud in the matter his brother,  because an avenger [is] the Lord of all these, as also we spake  before to you and testified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>for God did not call us on uncleanness, but in  sanctification;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>he, therefore, who is despising -- doth not despise man, but  God, who also did give His Holy Spirit to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>And concerning the brotherly love, ye have no need of [my]  writing to you, for ye yourselves are God-taught to love one  another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>for ye do it also to all the brethren who [are] in all  Macedonia; and we call upon you, brethren, to abound still  more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and to study to be quiet, and to do your own business, and  to work with your own hands, as we did command you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that ye may walk becomingly unto those without, and may  have lack of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>And I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning  those who have fallen asleep, that ye may not sorrow, as also  the rest who have not hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, so also  God those asleep through Jesus he will bring with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>for this to you we say in the word of the Lord, that we who  are living -- who do remain over to the presence of the Lord  -- may not precede those asleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>because the Lord himself, in a shout, in the voice of a  chief-messenger, and in the trump of God, shall come down from  heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>then we who are living, who are remaining over, together  with them shall be caught away in clouds to meet the Lord in  air, and so always with the Lord we shall be;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>so, then, comfort ye one another in these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>And concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, ye have  no need of my writing to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>for yourselves have known thoroughly that the day of the  Lord as a thief in the night doth so come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>for when they may say, Peace and surety, then sudden  destruction doth stand by them, as the travail [doth] her who  is with child, and they shall not escape;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>and ye, brethren, are not in darkness, that the day may  catch you as a thief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>all ye are sons of light, and sons of day; we are not of  night, nor of darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>so, then, we may not sleep as also the others, but watch and  be sober,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>for those sleeping, by night do sleep, and those making  themselves drunk, by night are drunken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>and we, being of the day -- let us be sober, putting on a  breastplate of faith and love, and an helmet -- a hope of  salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>because God did not appoint us to anger, but to the  acquiring of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who did die for us, that whether we wake -- whether we  sleep -- together with him we may live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>wherefore, comfort ye one another, and build ye up, one the  one, as also ye do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we ask you, brethren, to know those labouring among  you, and leading you in the Lord, and admonishing you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them very abundantly in love, because of  their work; be at peace among yourselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>and we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly,  comfort the feeble-minded, support the infirm, be patient unto  all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>see no one evil for evil may render to any one, but always  that which is good pursue ye, both to one another and to all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>always rejoice ye;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>continually pray ye;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>in every thing give thanks, for this [is] the will of God  in Christ Jesus in regard to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>The Spirit quench not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>prophesyings despise not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>all things prove; that which is good hold fast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>from all appearance of evil abstain ye;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>and the God of the peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and  may your whole spirit, and soul, and body, be preserved  unblameably in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>stedfast is He who is calling you, who also will do [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>salute all the brethren in an holy kiss;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I charge you [by] the Lord, that the letter be read to all  the holy brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ [is] with you! Amen.</verse>
