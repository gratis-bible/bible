and I give to Esau  mount Seir, to possess it; and Jacob and his sons have gone  down to Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And I send Moses and Aaron, and plague Egypt, as I have  done in its midst, and afterwards I have brought you out.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And I bring out your fathers from Egypt, and ye go into the  sea, and the Egyptians pursue after your fathers, with chariot  and with horsemen, to the Red Sea;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>and they cry unto Jehovah, and He setteth thick darkness  between you and the Egyptians, and bringeth on them the sea,  and covereth them, and your eyes see that which I have done in  Egypt; and ye dwell in a wilderness many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>`And I bring you in unto the land of the Amorite who is  dwelling beyond the Jordan, and they fight with you, and I give  them into your hand, and ye possess their land, and I destroy  them out of your presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>`And Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, riseth and fighteth  against Israel, and sendeth and calleth for Balaam son of Beor,  to revile you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and I have not been willing to hearken to Balaam, and he  doth greatly bless you, and I deliver you out of his hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>`And ye pass over the Jordan, and come in unto Jericho,  and fight against you do the possessors of Jericho -- the  Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite,  and the Girgashite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite -- and I give  them into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And I send before you the hornet, and it casteth them out  from your presence -- two kings of the Amorite -- not by thy  sword, nor by thy bow.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`And I give to you a land for which thou hast not  laboured, and cities which ye have not built, and ye dwell in  them; of vineyards and olive-yards which ye have not planted ye  are eating.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>`And now, fear ye Jehovah, and serve Him, in perfection  and in truth, and turn aside the gods which your fathers served  beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and if wrong in your eyes to serve Jehovah -- choose for  you to-day whom ye do serve; -- whether the gods whom your  fathers served, which [are] beyond the River, or the gods of  the Amorite in whose land ye are dwelling; and I and my house  -- we serve Jehovah.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the people answer and say, `Far be it from us to  forsake Jehovah, to serve other gods;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for Jehovah our God [is] He who is bringing us and our  fathers up out of the land of Egypt, out of a house of  servants, and who hath done before our eyes these great signs,  and doth keep us in all the way in which we have gone, and  among all the peoples through whose midst we passed;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and Jehovah casteth out the whole of the peoples, even the  Amorite inhabiting the land, from our presence; we also do  serve Jehovah, for He [is] our God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And Joshua saith unto the people, `Ye are not able to  serve Jehovah, for a God most holy He [is]; a zealous God He  [is]; He doth not bear with your transgression and with your  sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>When ye forsake Jehovah, and have served gods of a  stranger, then He hath turned back and done evil to you, and  consumed you, after that He hath done good to you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people saith unto Joshua, `No, but Jehovah we do  serve.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Joshua saith unto the people, `Witnesses ye are  against yourselves, that ye have chosen for you Jehovah to  serve Him (and they say, `Witnesses!`)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and, now, turn aside the gods of the stranger which [are]  in your midst, and incline your heart unto Jehovah, God of  Israel.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the people say unto Joshua, `Jehovah our God we serve,  and to His voice we hearken.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And Joshua maketh a covenant with the people on that day,  and layeth on it a statute and an ordinance, in Shechem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And Joshua writeth these words in the Book of the Law of  God, and taketh a great stone, and raiseth it up there under  the oak which [is] in the sanctuary of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Joshua saith unto all the people, `Lo, this stone is  against us for a witness, for it hath heard all the sayings of  Jehovah which He hath spoken with us, and it hath been against  you for a witness, lest ye lie against your God.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Joshua sendeth the people away, each to his  inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And it cometh to pass, after these things, that Joshua son  of Nun, servant of Jehovah, dieth, a son of a hundred and ten  years,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in  Timnath-Serah, which [is] in the hill-country of Ephraim, on  the north of the hill of Gaash.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And Israel serveth Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all  the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, and who  knew all the work of Jehovah which He did to Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel brought  up out of Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the  field which Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor father of  Shechem, with a hundred kesitah; and they are to the sons of  Joseph for an inheritance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And Eleazar son of Aaron died, and they bury him in the  hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him in the  hill-country of Ephraim.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
