  <div osisID='Heb' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to  the fathers in the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He  appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the  ages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of  His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying  of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our  sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the  highest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become so much better than the messengers, as he did  inherit a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou  art -- I to-day have begotten thee?` and again, `I will be to  him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world,  He saith, `And let them bow before him -- all messengers of  God;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making  His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>and unto the Son: `Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the  age; a scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of thy reign;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness;  because of this did He anoint thee -- God, thy God -- with oil  of gladness above thy partners;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>and, `Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found,  and a work of thy hands are the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a  garment, shall become old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they  shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall  not fail.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>And unto which of the messengers said He ever, `Sit at My  right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration  being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Because of this it behoveth [us] more abundantly to take  heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>for if the word being spoken through messengers did become  stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive  a just recompense,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation?  which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord  -- by those having heard was confirmed to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders,  and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit,  according to His will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For not to messengers did He subject the coming world,  concerning which we speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, `What  is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that  Thou dost look after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou didst make him some little less than messengers, with  glory and honour Thou didst crown him, and didst set him over  the works of Thy hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet,` for  in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave  to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things  subjected to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>and him who was made some little less than messengers we see  -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory  and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for  every one he might taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was becoming to Him, because of whom [are] the all  things, and through whom [are] the all things, many sons to  glory bringing, the author of their salvation through  sufferings to make perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified [are]  all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them  brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying, `I will declare Thy name to my brethren, in the  midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee;` and again,  `I will be trusting on Him;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>and again, `Behold I and the children that God did give to  me.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and  blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the  same, that through death he might destroy him having the power  of death -- that is, the devil --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death,  throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of  seed of Abraham it layeth hold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like  to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast  chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for  the sins of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able  to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling,  consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession,  Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in  all his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted  worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth  build it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all  things did build [is] God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>and Moses indeed [was] stedfast in all his house, as an  attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be  spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if  the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we  hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, `To-day, if His voice  ye may hear --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the  day of the temptation in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and  saw My works forty years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said,  Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My  ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest --  !`)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil  heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is  called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness  of the sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the  beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>in its being said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye  may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did  come out of Egypt through Moses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with  those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His  rest, except to those who did not believe? --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>and we see that they were not able to enter in because of  unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering  into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they,  but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with  faith in those who heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He  said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest  -- ;` and yet the works were done from the foundation of the  world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh [day]  thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and in this [place] again, `If they shall enter into My rest  -- ;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and  those who did first hear good news entered not in because of  unbelief --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,` (in David  saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day,  if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning  another day have spoken after these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of  God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his  works, as God from His own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no  one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp  above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing  asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow,  and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him,  but all things [are] naked and open to His eyes -- with whom  is our reckoning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the  heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the  profession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with  our infirmities, but [one] tempted in all things in like  manner -- apart from sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the  grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for  seasonable help.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every chief priest -- out of men taken -- in behalf of  men is set in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer  both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since  himself also is compassed with infirmity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people,  so also for himself to offer for sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is  called by God, as also Aaron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief  priest, but He who spake unto him: `My Son thou art, I to-day  have begotten thee;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>as also in another [place] He saith, `Thou [art] a priest --  to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications  unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong  crying and tears -- having offered up, and having been heard  in respect to that which he feared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>through being a Son, did learn by the things which he  suffered -- the obedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and having been made perfect, he did become to all those  obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to  the order of Melchisedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard  explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again  ye have need that one teach you what [are] the elements of the  beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having  need of milk, and not of strong food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>for every one who is partaking of milk [is] unskilled in  the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the  use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both  of good and of evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Wherefore, having left the word of the beginning of the  Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a  foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith  on God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of  rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>and this we will do, if God may permit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>for [it is] impossible for those once enlightened, having  tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became  of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the  coming age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and having fallen away, again to renew [them] to  reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of  God, and exposed to public shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming  upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of  whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>and that which is bearing thorns and briers [is] disapproved  of, and nigh to cursing, whose end [is] for burning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things  that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus  we speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the  labour of the love, that ye shewed to His name, having  ministered to the saints and ministering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew,  unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that ye may not become slothful, but followers of those who  through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the  promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able  to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, `Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying  I will multiply thee;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the  promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all  controversy to them for confirmation [is] the oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs  of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose  by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that through two immutable things, in which [it is]  impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who  did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before [us],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and  stedfast, and entering into that within the vail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus, after the  order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most  High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of  the kings, and did bless him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first,  indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,` and then  also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having  neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like  to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth  Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the  priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people  according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though  they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received  tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath  blessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is  blessed --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there  [he], who is testified to that he was living,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving  tithes, hath paid tithes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek  met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical  priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what  further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for  another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the  order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the  law a change doth come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath  had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord,  in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning  priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to  the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but  according to the power of an endless life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>for He doth testify -- `Thou [art] a priest -- to the age,  according to the order of Melchisedek;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going  before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a  better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those  indeed apart from oath are become priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him,  `The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest -- to  the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;`)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>and those indeed are many who have become priests, because  by death they are hindered from remaining;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the  priesthood not transient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>whence also he is able to save to the very end, those  coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession  for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless,  undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than  the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first  for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the  people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having  infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law  [appointeth] the Son -- to the age having been perfected.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>And the sum concerning the things spoken of [is]: we have  such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the  throne of the greatness in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle,  which the Lord did set up, and not man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is  appointed, whence [it is] necessary for this one to have also  something that he may offer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest  -- (there being the priests who are offering according to the  law, the gifts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly  things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to  construct the tabernacle, for `See (saith He) thou mayest make  all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in  the mount;`) --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>and now he hath obtained a more excellent service, how much  also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better  promises hath been sanctioned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>for if that first were faultless, a place would not have  been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault, He saith to them, `Lo, days come, saith  the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and  with the house of Judah, a new covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the covenant that I made with their  fathers, in the day of My taking [them] by their hand, to bring  them out of the land of Egypt -- because they did not remain in  My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord, --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>because this [is] the covenant that I will make with the  house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, giving My  laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them,  and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me for a  people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his  brother, saying, Know thou the Lord, because they shall all  know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and  their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;`  --</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances  of service, also a worldly sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both  the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence --  which is called `Holy;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called `Holy  of holies,`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid  all round about with gold, in which [is] the golden pot having  the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of  the covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the  mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak  particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>And these things having been thus prepared, into the first  tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in,  performing the services,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>and into the second, once in the year, only the chief  priest, not apart from blood, which he doth offer for himself  and the errors of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been  manifested the way of the holy [places], the first tabernacle  having yet a standing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>which [is] a simile in regard to the present time, in which  both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in  regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and  fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed  upon [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good  things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not  made with hands -- that is, not of this creation --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his  own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during  redemption having obtained;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an  heifer, sprinkling those defiled, doth sanctify to the  purifying of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through  the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God)  purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living  God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator,  that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions  under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise  of the age-during inheritance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>for where a covenant [is], the death of the covenant-victim  to come in is necessary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>for a covenant over dead victims [is] stedfast, since it is  no force at all when the covenant-victim liveth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>whence not even the first apart from blood hath been  initiated,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>for every command having been spoken, according to law, by  Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves  and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both  the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, `This [is] the blood of the covenant that God  enjoined unto you,`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service  with blood in like manner he did sprinkle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>and with blood almost all things are purified according to  the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness doth not  come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>[It is] necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the  things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the  heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ  enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself, now  to be manifested in the presence of God for us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief  priest doth enter into the holy places every year with blood of  others;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the  foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the  ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he hath  been manifested;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this --  judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the  sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall  appear, to those waiting for him -- to salvation!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law having a shadow of the coming good things --  not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same  sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make  perfect those coming near,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>but in those [sacrifices] is a remembrance of sins every  year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take  away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, `Sacrifice and  offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare  for me,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath  been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;`</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and  the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to  take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the  end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those  sanctified;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.27'>and this -- `Yet once` -- doth make evident the removal of  the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the  things not shaken may remain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.28'>wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may  we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly,  with reverence and religious fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.29'>for also our God [is] a consuming fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.1'>Let brotherly love remain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.2'>of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this  unawares certain did entertain messengers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.3'>be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with  them, of those maltreated, as also yourselves being in the  body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.4'>honourable [is] the marriage in all, and the bed undefiled,  and whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.5'>Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the  things present, for He hath said, `No, I will not leave, no,  nor forsake thee,`</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.13.15'>through him, then, we may offer up a sacrifice of praise  always to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to  His name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.16'>and of doing good, and of fellowship, be not forgetful,  for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.13.17'>Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for  these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that  with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this [is]  unprofitable to you.</verse>
