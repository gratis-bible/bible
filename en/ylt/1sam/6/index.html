let us know  wherewith we send it to its place?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And they say, `If ye are sending away the ark of the God of  Israel, ye do not send it away empty; for ye do certainly send  back to Him a guilt-offering; then ye are healed, and it hath  been known to you why His hand doth not turn aside from you.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And they say, `What [is] the guilt-offering which we send  back to Him?` and they say, `The number of the princes of the  Philistines -- five golden emerods, and five golden mice -- for one  plague [is] to you all, and to your princes,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>and ye have made images of your emerods, and images of your  mice that are corrupting the land, and have given honour to the  God of Israel; it may be He doth lighten His hand from off you,  and from off your gods, and from off your land;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>and why do ye harden your heart as the Egyptians and Pharaoh  hardened their heart? do they not -- when He hath rolled Himself  upon them -- send them away, and they go?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>`And now, take and make one new cart, and two suckling kine,  on which a yoke hath not gone up, and ye have bound the kine in  the cart, and caused their young ones to turn back from after  them to the house,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>and ye have taken the ark of Jehovah, and put it on the  cart, and the vessels of gold which ye have returned to Him -- a  guilt-offering -- ye put in a coffer on its side, and have sent  it away, and it hath gone;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>and ye have seen, if the way of its own border it goeth up  to Beth-Shemesh -- He hath done to us this great evil; and if  not, then we have known that His hand hath not come against us;  an accident it hath been to us.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the men do so, and take two suckling kine, and bind  them in the cart, and their young ones they have shut up in the  house;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and they place the ark of Jehovah upon the cart, and the  coffer, and the golden mice, and the images of their emerods.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the kine go straight in the way, on the way to  Beth-Shemesh, in one highway they have gone, going and lowing,  and have not turned aside right or left; and the princes of the  Philistines are going after them unto the border of  Beth-Shemesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the Beth-Shemeshites are reaping their wheat-harvest in  the valley, and they lift up their eyes, and see the ark, and  rejoice to see [it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the cart hath come in unto the field of Joshua the  Beth-Shemeshite, and standeth there, and there [is] a great  stone, and they cleave the wood of the cart, and the kine they  have caused to ascend -- a burnt-offering to Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the Levites have taken down the ark of Jehovah, and the  coffer which [is] with it, in which [are] the vessels of gold,  and place [them] on the great stone; and the men of  Beth-Shemesh have caused to ascend burnt-offerings and  sacrifice sacrifices in that day to Jehovah;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>and the five princes of the Philistines have seen [it], and  turn back [to] Ekron, on that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And these [are] the golden emerods which the Philistines  have sent back -- a guilt-offering to Jehovah: for Ashdod one,  for Gaza one, for Ashkelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron one;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and the golden mice -- the number of all the cities of the  Philistines -- for the five princes, from the fenced city even  unto the hamlet of the villages, even unto the great meadow on  which they placed the ark of Jehovah -- [are] unto this day in  the field of Joshua the Beth-Shemeshite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And He smiteth among the men of Beth-Shemesh, for they  looked into the ark of Jehovah, yea, He smiteth among the  people seventy men -- fifty chief men; and the people mourn,  because Jehovah smote among the people -- a great smiting.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the men of Beth-Shemesh say, `Who is able to stand  before Jehovah, this holy God?
