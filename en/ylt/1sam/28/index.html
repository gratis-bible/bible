and why  art thou laying a snare for my soul -- to put me to death?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Saul sweareth to her by Jehovah, saying, `Jehovah  liveth, punishment doth not meet thee for this thing.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And the woman saith, `Whom do I bring up to thee?` and he  saith, `Samuel -- bring up to me.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the woman seeth Samuel, and crieth with a loud voice,  and the woman speaketh unto Saul, saying, `Why hast thou  deceived me -- and thou Saul?`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And the king saith to her, `Do not fear; for what hast  thou seen?` and the woman saith unto Saul, `Gods I have seen  coming up out of the earth.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he saith to her, `What [is] his form?` and she  saith, `An aged man is coming up, and he [is] covered with an  upper robe;` and Saul knoweth that he [is] Samuel, and  boweth -- face to thee earth -- and doth obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And Samuel saith unto Saul, `Why hast thou troubled me,  to bring me up?` And Saul saith, `I have great distress, and  the Philistines are fighting against me, God hath turned aside  from me, and hath not answered me any more, either by the hand  of the prophets, or by dreams; and I call for thee to let me  know what I do.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Samuel saith, `And why dost thou ask me, and Jehovah  hath turned aside from thee, and is thine enemy?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jehovah doth for Himself as He hath spoken by my hand,  and Jehovah rendeth the kingdom out of thy hand, and giveth it  to thy neighbour -- to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because thou hast not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah,  nor didst the fierceness of His anger on Amalek -- therefore this  thing hath Jehovah done to thee this day;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>yea, Jehovah giveth also Israel with thee into the hand of  the Philistines, and tomorrow thou and thy sons [are] with me;  also the camp of Israel doth Jehovah give into the hand of the  Philistines.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Saul hasteth and falleth -- the fulness of his  stature -- to the earth, and feareth greatly because of the words  of Samuel; also power was not in him, for he had not eaten  bread all the day, and all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the woman cometh in unto Saul, and seeth that he hath  been greatly troubled, and saith unto him, `Lo, thy  maid-servant hath hearkened to thy voice, and I put my soul in  my hand, and I obey thy words which thou hast spoken unto me;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>and now, hearken, I pray thee, also thou, to the voice of  thy maid-servant, and I set before thee a morsel of bread, and  eat, and there is in thee power when thou goest in the way.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And he refuseth, and saith, `I do not eat;` and his  servants urge on him, and also the woman, and he hearkeneth to  their voice, and riseth from the earth, and sitteth on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the woman hath a calf of the stall in the house, and  she hasteth and slaughtereth it, and taketh flour, and  kneadeth, and baketh it unleavened things,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and bringeth nigh before Saul, and before his servants,  and they eat, and rise, and go on, during that night.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
