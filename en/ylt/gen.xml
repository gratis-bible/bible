        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning of God`s preparing the heavens and the  earth --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>the earth hath existed waste and void, and darkness [is] on  the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God fluttering on the  face of the waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>and God saith, `Let light be;` and light is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God seeth the light that [it is] good, and God  separateth between the light and the darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>and God calleth to the light `Day,` and to the darkness He  hath called `Night;` and there is an evening, and there is a  morning -- day one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God saith, `Let an expanse be in the midst of the  waters, and let it be separating between waters and waters.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God maketh the expanse, and it separateth between the  waters which [are] under the expanse, and the waters which  [are] above the expanse: and it is so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God calleth to the expanse `Heavens;` and there is an  evening, and there is a morning -- day second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God saith, `Let the waters under the heavens be  collected unto one place, and let the dry land be seen:` and it  is so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God calleth to the dry land `Earth,` and to the  collection of the waters He hath called `Seas;` and God seeth  that [it is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God saith, `Let the earth yield tender grass, herb  sowing seed, fruit-tree (whose seed [is] in itself) making  fruit after its kind, on the earth:` and it is so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth bringeth forth tender grass, herb sowing seed  after its kind, and tree making fruit (whose seed [is] in  itself) after its kind; and God seeth that [it is] good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day  third.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God saith, `Let luminaries be in the expanse of the  heavens, to make a separation between the day and the night,  then they have been for signs, and for seasons, and for days  and years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>and they have been for luminaries in the expanse of the  heavens to give light upon the earth:` and it is so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God maketh the two great luminaries, the great luminary  for the rule of the day, and the small luminary -- and the  stars -- for the rule of the night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>and God giveth them in the expanse of the heavens to give  light upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule over day and over night, and to make a  separation between the light and the darkness; and God seeth  that [it is] good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day  fourth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God saith, `Let the waters teem with the teeming living  creature, and fowl let fly on the earth on the face of the  expanse of the heavens.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God prepareth the great monsters, and every living  creature that is creeping, which the waters have teemed with,  after their kind, and every fowl with wing, after its kind, and  God seeth that [it is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blesseth them, saying, `Be fruitful, and multiply,  and fill the waters in the seas, and the fowl let multiply in  the earth:`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>and there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day  fifth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God saith, `Let the earth bring forth the living  creature after its kind, cattle and creeping thing, and beast  of the earth after its kind:` and it is so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God maketh the beast of the earth after its kind, and  the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing of the  ground after its kind, and God seeth that [it is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God saith, `Let Us make man in Our image, according to  Our likeness, and let them rule over fish of the sea, and over  fowl of the heavens, and over cattle, and over all the earth,  and over every creeping thing that is creeping on the earth.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God prepareth the man in His image; in the image of God  He prepared him, a male and a female He prepared them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blesseth them, and God saith to them, `Be fruitful,  and multiply, and fill the earth, and subdue it, and rule over  fish of the sea, and over fowl of the heavens, and over every  living thing that is creeping upon the earth.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God saith, `Lo, I have given to you every herb sowing  seed, which [is] upon the face of all the earth, and every tree  in which [is] the fruit of a tree sowing seed, to you it is for  food;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>and to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the  heavens, and to every creeping thing on the earth, in which  [is] breath of life, every green herb [is] for food:` and it is  so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God seeth all that He hath done, and lo, very good; and  there is an evening, and there is a morning -- day the sixth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>And the heavens and the earth are completed, and all their  host;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>and God completeth by the seventh day His work which He hath  made, and ceaseth by the seventh day from all His work which He  hath made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blesseth the seventh day, and sanctifieth it, for in  it He hath ceased from all His work which God had prepared for  making.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These [are] births of the heavens and of the earth in their  being prepared, in the day of Jehovah God`s making earth and  heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>and no shrub of the field is yet in the earth, and no herb  of the field yet sprouteth, for Jehovah God hath not rained  upon the earth, and a man there is not to serve the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>and a mist goeth up from the earth, and hath watered the  whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And Jehovah God formeth the man -- dust from the ground, and  breatheth into his nostrils breath of life, and the man  becometh a living creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And Jehovah God planteth a garden in Eden, at the east, and  He setteth there the man whom He hath formed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>and Jehovah God causeth to sprout from the ground every tree  desirable for appearance, and good for food, and the tree of  life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of knowledge of  good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river is going out from Eden to water the garden, and  from thence it is parted, and hath become four chief [rivers];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>the name of the one [is] Pison, it [is] that which is  surrounding the whole land of the Havilah where the gold [is],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>and the gold of that land [is] good, there [is] the bdolach  and the shoham stone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>and the name of the second river [is] Gibon, it [is] that  which is surrounding the whole land of Cush;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>and the name of the third river [is] Hiddekel, it [is] that  which is going east of Asshur; and the fourth river is Phrat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And Jehovah God taketh the man, and causeth him to rest in  the garden of Eden, to serve it, and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And Jehovah God layeth a charge on the man, saying, `Of  every tree of the garden eating thou dost eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>and of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, thou dost  not eat of it, for in the day of thine eating of it -- dying  thou dost die.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And Jehovah God saith, `Not good for the man to be alone, I  do make to him an helper -- as his counterpart.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And Jehovah God formeth from the ground every beast of the  field, and every fowl of the heavens, and bringeth in unto the  man, to see what he doth call it; and whatever the man calleth  a living creature, that [is] its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And the man calleth names to all the cattle, and to fowl of  the heavens, and to every beast of the field; and to man hath  not been found an helper -- as his counterpart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And Jehovah God causeth a deep sleep to fall upon the man,  and he sleepeth, and He taketh one of his ribs, and closeth up  flesh in its stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And Jehovah God buildeth up the rib which He hath taken out  of the man into a woman, and bringeth her in unto the man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>and the man saith, `This [is] the [proper] step! bone of my  bone, and flesh of my flesh!` for this it is called Woman, for  from a man hath this been taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>therefore doth a man leave his father and his mother, and  hath cleaved unto his wife, and they have become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they are both of them naked, the man and his wife, and  they are not ashamed of themselves.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>And the serpent hath been subtile above every beast of the  field which Jehovah God hath made, and he saith unto the woman,  `Is it true that God hath said, Ye do not eat of every tree of  the garden?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman saith unto the serpent, `Of the fruit of the  trees of the garden we do eat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>and of the fruit of the tree which [is] in the midst of the  garden God hath said, Ye do not eat of it, nor touch it, lest  ye die.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent saith unto the woman, `Dying, ye do not die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>for God doth know that in the day of your eating of it --  your eyes have been opened, and ye have been as God, knowing  good and evil.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And the woman seeth that the tree [is] good for food, and  that it [is] pleasant to the eyes, and the tree is desirable to  make [one] wise, and she taketh of its fruit and eateth, and  giveth also to her husband with her, and he doth eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>and the eyes of them both are opened, and they know that  they [are] naked, and they sew fig-leaves, and make to  themselves girdles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they hear the sound of Jehovah God walking up and down  in the garden at the breeze of the day, and the man and his  wife hide themselves from the face of Jehovah God in the midst  of the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And Jehovah God calleth unto the man, and saith to him,  `Where [art] thou?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>and he saith, `Thy sound I have heard in the garden, and I  am afraid, for I am naked, and I hide myself.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And He saith, `Who hath declared to thee that thou [art]  naked? of the tree of which I have commanded thee not to eat,  hast thou eaten?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>and the man saith, `The woman whom Thou didst place with me  -- she hath given to me of the tree -- and I do eat.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And Jehovah God saith to the woman, `What [is] this thou  hast done?` and the woman saith, `The serpent hath caused me to  forget -- and I do eat.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And Jehovah God saith unto the serpent, `Because thou hast  done this, cursed [art] thou above all the cattle, and above  every beast of the field: on thy belly dost thou go, and dust  thou dost eat, all days of thy life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>and enmity I put between thee and the woman, and between  thy seed and her seed; he doth bruise thee -- the head, and  thou dost bruise him -- the heel.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>Unto the woman He said, `Multiplying I multiply thy sorrow  and thy conception, in sorrow dost thou bear children, and  toward thy husband [is] thy desire, and he doth rule over  thee.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to the man He said, `Because thou hast hearkened to the  voice of thy wife, and dost eat of the tree concerning which I  have charged thee, saying, Thou dost not eat of it, cursed [is]  the ground on thine account; in sorrow thou dost eat of it all  days of thy life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>and thorn and bramble it doth bring forth to thee, and thou  hast eaten the herb of the field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>by the sweat of thy face thou dost eat bread till thy  return unto the ground, for out of it hast thou been taken, for  dust thou [art], and unto dust thou turnest back.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And the man calleth his wife`s name Eve: for she hath been  mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And Jehovah God doth make to the man and to his wife coats  of skin, and doth clothe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And Jehovah God saith, `Lo, the man was as one of Us, as to  the knowledge of good and evil; and now, lest he send forth his  hand, and have taken also of the tree of life, and eaten, and  lived to the age,` --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>Jehovah God sendeth him forth from the garden of Eden to  serve the ground from which he hath been taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>yea, he casteth out the man, and causeth to dwell at the  east of the garden of Eden the cherubs and the flame of the  sword which is turning itself round to guard the way of the  tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceiveth and  beareth Cain, and saith, `I have gotten a man by Jehovah;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>and she addeth to bear his brother, even Abel. And Abel is  feeding a flock, and Cain hath been servant of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And it cometh to pass at the end of days that Cain bringeth  from the fruit of the ground a present to Jehovah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>and Abel, he hath brought, he also, from the female  firstlings of his flock, even from their fat ones; and Jehovah  looketh unto Abel and unto his present,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>and unto Cain and unto his present He hath not looked; and  it is very displeasing to Cain, and his countenance is fallen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Why hast thou displeasure? and  why hath thy countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>Is there not, if thou dost well, acceptance? and if thou  dost not well, at the opening a sin-offering is crouching, and  unto thee its desire, and thou rulest over it.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain saith unto Abel his brother, [`Let us go into the  field;`] and it cometh to pass in their being in the field,  that Cain riseth up against Abel his brother, and slayeth him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And Jehovah saith unto Cain, `Where [is] Abel thy brother?`  and he saith, `I have not known; my brother`s keeper -- I?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And He saith, `What hast thou done? the voice of thy  brother`s blood is crying unto Me from the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>and now, cursed [art] thou from the ground, which hath  opened her mouth to receive the blood of thy brother from thy  hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>when thou tillest the ground, it doth not add to give its  strength to thee -- a wanderer, even a trembling one, thou art  in the earth.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain saith unto Jehovah, `Greater is my punishment than  to be borne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>lo, Thou hast driven me to-day from off the face of the  ground, and from Thy face I am hid; and I have been a wanderer,  even a trembling one, in the earth, and it hath been -- every  one finding me doth slay me.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And Jehovah saith to him, `Therefore -- of any slayer of  Cain sevenfold it is required;` and Jehovah setteth to Cain a  token that none finding him doth slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain goeth out from before Jehovah, and dwelleth in the  land, moving about east of Eden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>and Cain knoweth his wife, and she conceiveth, and beareth  Enoch; and he is building a city, and he calleth the name of  the city, according to the name of his son -- Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And born to Enoch is Irad; and Irad hath begotten Mehujael;  and Mehujael hath begotten Methusael; and Methusael hath  begotten Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech taketh to himself two wives, the name of the  one Adah, and the name of the second Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah beareth Jabal, he hath been father of those  inhabiting tents and purchased possessions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>and the name of his brother [is] Jubal, he hath been father  of every one handling harp and organ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And Zillah she also bare Tubal-Cain, an instructor of every  artificer in brass and iron; and a sister of Tubal-Cain [is]  Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lamech saith to his wives: -- `Adah and Zillah, hear my  voice; Wives of Lamech, give ear [to] my saying: For a man I  have slain for my wound, Even a young man for my hurt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>For sevenfold is required for Cain, And for Lamech seventy  and sevenfold.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam again knoweth his wife, and she beareth a son, and  calleth his name Seth, `for God hath appointed for me another  seed instead of Abel:` for Cain had slain him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And to Seth, to him also a son hath been born, and he  calleth his name Enos; then a beginning was made of preaching  in the name of Jehovah.</verse>
