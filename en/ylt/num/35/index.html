also a suburb for the cities round about them ye do  give to the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And the cities have been to them to inhabit, and their  suburbs are for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all  their beasts.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>`And the suburbs of the cities which ye give to the Levites  [are], from the wall of the city and without, a thousand cubits  round about.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And ye have measured from the outside of the city, the east  quarter, two thousand by the cubit, and the south quarter, two  thousand by the cubit, and the west quarter, two thousand by  the cubit, and the north quarter, two thousand by the cubit;  and the city [is] in the midst; this is to them the suburbs of  the cities.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>`And the cities which ye give to the Levites [are] the six  cities of refuge, which ye give for the fleeing thither of the  man-slayer, and besides them ye give forty and two cities;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>all the cities which ye give to the Levites [are] forty and  eight cities, them and their suburbs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the cities which ye give [are] of the possession of the  sons of Israel, from the many ye multiply, and from the few ye  diminish; each, according to his inheritance which they  inherit, doth give of his cities to the Levites.`</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah speaketh unto Moses, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>`Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto  them, When ye are passing over the Jordan to the land of  Canaan,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and have prepared to yourselves cities -- cities of refuge  they are to you -- then fled thither hath a man-slayer, smiting  a person unawares,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>and the cities have been to you for a refuge from the  redeemer, and the man-slayer doth not die till his standing  before the company for judgment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>`As to the cities which ye give -- six [are] cities of  refuge to you;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>the three of the cities ye give beyond the Jordan, and the  three of the cities ye give in the land of Canaan; cities of  refuge they are.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>To sons of Israel, and to a sojourner, and to a settler in  their midst, are these six cities for a refuge, for the fleeing  thither of any one smiting a person unawares.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>`And if with an instrument of iron he hath smitten him,  and he dieth, he [is] a murderer: the murderer is certainly put  to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>`And if with a stone [in] the hand, wherewith he dieth, he  hath smitten him, and he dieth, he [is] a murderer: the  murderer is certainly put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>`Or with a wooden instrument [in] the hand, wherewith he  dieth, he hath smitten him, and he dieth, he [is] a murderer:  the murderer is certainly put to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>`The redeemer of blood himself doth put the murderer to  death; in his coming against him he doth put him to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>`And if in hatred he thrust him through, or hath cast  [anything] at him by lying in wait, and he dieth;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>or in enmity he hath smitten him with his hand, and he  dieth; the smiter is certainly put to death; he [is] a  murderer; the redeemer of blood doth put the murderer to death  in his coming against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>`And if, in an instant, without enmity, he hath thrust him  through, or hath cast at him any instrument, without lying in  wait;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>or with any stone wherewith he dieth, without seeing, and  causeth [it] to fall upon him, and he dieth, and he [is] not  his enemy, nor seeking his evil;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>then have the company judged between the smiter and the  redeemer of blood, by these judgments.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>`And the company have delivered the man-slayer out of the  hand of the redeemer of blood, and the company have caused him  to turn back unto the city of his refuge, whither he hath fled,  and he hath dwelt in it till the death of the chief priest, who  hath been anointed with the holy oil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>`And if the man-slayer at all go out [from] the border of  the city of his refuge whither he fleeth,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>and the redeemer of blood hath found him at the outside of  the border of the city of his refuge, and the redeemer of blood  hath slain the man-slayer, blood is not for him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>for in the city of his refuge he doth dwell till the death  of the chief priest; and after the death of the chief priest  doth the man-slayer turn back unto the city of his possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>`And these things have been to you for a statute of  judgment to your generations, in all your dwellings:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>whoso smiteth a person, by the mouth of witnesses doth  [one] slay the murderer; and one witness doth not testify  against a person -- to die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>`And ye take no atonement for the life of a murderer who  [is] condemned -- to die, for he is certainly put to death;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>and ye take no atonement for him to flee unto the city of  his refuge, to turn back to dwell in the land, until the death  of the priest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>`And ye profane not the land which ye [are] in, for blood  profaneth the land; as to the land, it is not pardoned for  blood which is shed in it except by the blood of him who  sheddeth it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>and ye defile not the land in which ye are dwelling, in  the midst of which I do tabernacle, for I Jehovah do tabernacle  in the midst of the sons of Israel.`</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
