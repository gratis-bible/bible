      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>And it cometh to pass, in the days of Ahasuerus -- he [is]  Ahasuerus who is reigning from Hodu even unto Cush, seven and  twenty and a hundred provinces --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>in those days, at the sitting of the king Ahasuerus on the  throne of his kingdom, that [is] in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>in the third year of his reign, he hath made a banquet to  all his heads and his servants; of the force of Persia and  Media, the chiefs and heads of the provinces [are] before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>in his shewing the wealth of the honour of his kingdom, and  the glory of the beauty of his greatness, many days -- eighty  and a hundred days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And at the fulness of these days hath the king made to all  the people who are found in Shushan the palace, from great even  unto small, a banquet, seven days, in the court of the garden  of the house of the king --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>white linen, white cotton, and blue, fastened with cords of  fine linen and purple on rings of silver, and pillars of  marble, couches of gold, and of silver, on a pavement of  smaragdus, and white marble, and mother-of-pearl, and black  marble --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>and the giving of drink in vessels of gold, and the vessels  [are] divers vessels, and the royal wine [is] abundant, as a  memorial of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And the drinking [is] according to law, none is pressing,  for so hath the king appointed for every chief one of his  house, to do according to the pleasure of man and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Also Vashti the queen hath made a banquet for women, in the  royal house that the king Ahasuerus hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the seventh day, as the heart of the king is glad with  wine, he hath said to Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and  Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who are  ministering in the presence of the king Ahasuerus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>to bring in Vashti the queen before the king, with a royal  crown, to shew the peoples and the heads her beauty, for she  [is] of good appearance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>and the queen Vashti refuseth to come in at the word of the  king that [is] by the hand of the eunuchs, and the king is very  wroth, and his fury hath burned in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>And the king saith to wise men, knowing the times -- for so  [is] the word of the king before all knowing law and judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>and he who is near unto him [is] Carshena, Shethar,  Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, Memucan, seven heads of  Persia and Media seeing the face of the king, who are sitting  first in the kingdom --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>`According to law, what -- to do with queen Vashti, because  that she hath not done the saying of the king Ahasuerus by the  hand of the eunuchs?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Memucan saith before the king and the heads, `Not  against the king by himself hath Vashti the queen done  perversely, but against all the heads, and against all the  peoples that [are] in all provinces of the king Ahasuerus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>for go forth doth the word of the queen unto all the women,  to render their husbands contemptible in their eyes, in their  saying, The king Ahasuerus said to bring in Vashti the queen  before him, and she did not come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>yea, this day do princesses of Persia and Media, who have  heard the word of the queen, say [so] to all heads of the king,  even according to the sufficiency of contempt and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>`If to the king [it be] good, there goeth forth a royal  word from before him, and it is written with the laws of Persia  and Media, and doth not pass away, that Vashti doth not come in  before the king Ahasuerus, and her royalty doth the king give  to her companion who [is] better than she;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>and the sentence of the king that he maketh hath been heard  in all his kingdom -- for it [is] great -- and all the wives  give honour to their husbands, from great even unto small.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And the thing is good in the eyes of the king, and of the  princes, and the king doth according to the word of Memucan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>and sendeth letters unto all provinces of the king, unto  province and province according to its writing, and unto people  and people according to its tongue, for every man being head in  his own house -- and speaking according to the language of his  people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, at the ceasing of the fury of the king  Ahasuerus, he hath remembered Vashti, and that which she did,  and that which hath been decreed concerning her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>and servants of the king, his ministers, say, `Let them seek  for the king young women, virgins, of good appearance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>and the king doth appoint inspectors in all provinces of his  kingdom, and they gather every young woman -- virgin, of good  appearance -- unto Shushan the palace, unto the house of the  women, unto the hand of Hege eunuch of the king, keeper of the  women, and to give their purifications,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>and the young woman who is good in the eyes of the king doth  reign instead of Vashti;` and the thing is good in the eyes of  the king, and he doth so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>A man, a Jew, there hath been in Shushan the palace, and his  name [is] Mordecai son of Jair, son of Shimei, son of Kish, a  Benjamite --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>who had been removed from Jerusalem with the removal that  was removed with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar  king of Babylon removed --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>and he is supporting Hadassah -- she [is] Esther -- daughter  of his uncle, for she hath neither father nor mother, and the  young woman [is] of fair form, and of good appearance, and at  the death of her father and her mother hath Mordecai taken her  to him for a daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>And it cometh to pass, in the word of the king, even his  law, being heard, and in many young women being gathered unto  Shushan the palace, unto the hand of Hegai, that Esther is  taken unto the house of the king, unto the hand of Hegai,  keeper of the women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>and the young woman is good in his eyes, and she receiveth  kindness before him, and he hasteneth her purifications and her  portions -- to give to her, and the seven young women who are  provided -- to give to her, from the house of the king, and he  changeth her and her young women to a good [place in] the house  of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>Esther hath not declared her people, and her kindred, for  Mordecai hath laid a charge on her that she doth not declare  [it];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>and during every day Mordecai is walking up and down before  the court of the house of the women to know the welfare of  Esther, and what is done with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>And in the drawing nigh of the turn of each young woman to  come in unto the king Ahasuerus, at the end of there being to  her -- according to the law of the women -- twelve months, for  so they fulfil the days of their purifications; six months with  oil of myrrh, and six months with spices, and with the  purifications of women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>and with this the young woman hath come in unto the king,  all that she saith is given to her, to go in with her, out of  the house of the women, unto the house of the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>in the evening she hath gone in, and in the morning she  hath turned back unto the second house of the women, unto the  hand of Shaashgaz eunuch of the king, keeper of the concubines;  she cometh not in any more unto the king except the king hath  delighted in her, and she hath been called by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>And in the drawing nigh of the turn of Esther -- daughter  of Abihail, uncle of Mordecai, whom he had taken to him for a  daughter -- to come in unto the king, she hath not sought a  thing except that which Hegai eunuch of the king, keeper of the  women, saith, and Esther is receiving grace in the eyes of all  seeing her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>And Esther is taken unto the king Ahasuerus, unto his royal  house, in the tenth month -- it [is] the month of Tebeth -- in  the seventh year of his reign,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>and the king loveth Esther above all the women, and she  receiveth grace and kindness before him above all the virgins,  and he setteth a royal crown on her head, and causeth her to  reign instead of Vashti,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>and the king maketh a great banquet to all his heads and  his servants -- the banquet of Esther -- and a release to the  provinces hath made, and giveth gifts as a memorial of the  king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>And in the virgins being gathered a second time, then  Mordecai is sitting in the gate of the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Esther is not declaring her kindred and her people, as  Mordecai hath laid a charge upon her, and the saying of  Mordecai Esther is doing as when she was truly with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>In those days, when Mordecai is sitting in the gate of the  king, hath Bigthan been wroth, and Teresh, (two of the eunuchs  of the king, the keepers of the threshold,) and they seek to  put forth a hand on king Ahasuerus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>and the thing is known to Mordecai, and he declareth [it]  to Esther the queen, and Esther speaketh to the king in the  name of Mordecai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>and the thing is sought out, and found, and they are hanged  both of them on a tree, and it is written in the book of the  Chronicles before the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things hath the king Ahasuerus exalted Haman son  of Hammedatha the Agagite, and lifteth him up, and setteth his  throne above all the heads who [are] with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>and all servants of the king, who [are] in the gate of the  king, are bowing and doing obeisance to Haman, for so hath the  king commanded for him; and Mordecai doth not bow nor do  obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>And the servants of the king, who [are] in the gate of the  king, say to Mordecai, `Wherefore [art] thou transgressing the  command of the king?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>And it cometh to pass, in their speaking unto him, day by  day, and he hath not hearkened unto them, that they declare  [it] to Haman, to see whether the words of Mordecai do stand,  for he hath declared to them that he [is] a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And Haman seeth that Mordecai is not bowing and doing  obeisance to him, and Haman is full of fury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>and it is contemptible in his eyes to put forth a hand on  Mordecai by himself, for they have declared to him the people  of Mordecai, and Haman seeketh to destroy all the Jews who  [are] in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus -- the people of  Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month -- it [is] the month of Nisan -- in the  twelfth year of the king Ahasuerus, hath one caused to fall Pur  (that [is] the lot) before Haman, from day to day, and from  month to month, [to] the twelfth, it [is] the month of Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And Haman saith to the king Ahasuerus, `There is one people  scattered and separated among the peoples, in all provinces of  thy kingdom, and their laws [are] diverse from all people, and  the laws of the king they are not doing, and for the king it is  not profitable to suffer them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>if to the king [it be] good, let it be written to destroy  them, and ten thousand talents of silver I weigh into the hands  of those doing the work, to bring [it] in unto the treasuries  of the king.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>And the king turneth aside his signet from off his hand,  and giveth it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, adversary  of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>and the king saith to Haman, `The silver is given to thee,  and the people, to do with it as [it is] good in thine eyes.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>And scribes of the king are called, on the first month, on  the thirteenth day of it, and it is written according to all  that Haman hath commanded, unto lieutenants of the king, and  unto the governors who [are] over province and province, and  unto the heads of people and people, province and province,  according to its writing, and people and people according to  its tongue, in the name of the king Ahasuerus it hath been  written and sealed with the signet of the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>and letters to be sent by the hand of the runners unto all  provinces of the king, to cut off, to slay, and to destroy all  the Jews, from young even unto old, infant and women, on one  day, on the thirteenth of the twelfth month -- it [is] the  month of Adar -- and their spoil to seize,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>a copy of the writing to be made law in every province and  province is revealed to all the peoples, to be ready for this  day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The runners have gone forth, hastened by the word of the  king, and the law hath been given in Shushan the palace, and  the king and Haman have sat down to drink, and the city Shushan  is perplexed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>And Mordecai hath known all that hath been done, and  Mordecai rendeth his garments, and putteth on sackcloth and  ashes, and goeth forth into the midst of the city and crieth --  a cry loud and bitter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>and he cometh in unto the front of the gate of the king, but  none is to come in unto the gate of the king with a  sackcloth-garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in every province and province, the place where the word  of the king, even his law, is coming, a great mourning have the  Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and lamenting: sackcloth and  ashes are spread for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>And young women of Esther come in and her eunuchs, and  declare [it] to her, and the queen is exceedingly pained, and  sendeth garments to clothe Mordecai, and to turn aside his  sackcloth from off him, and he hath not received [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>And Esther calleth to Hatach, of the eunuchs of the king,  whom he hath stationed before her, and giveth him a charge for  Mordecai, to know what this [is], and wherefore this [is].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>And Hatach goeth out unto Mordecai, unto a broad place of  the city, that [is] before the gate of the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>and Mordecai declareth to him all that hath met him, and the  explanation of the money that Haman said to weigh to the  treasuries of the king for the Jews, to destroy them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>and the copy of the writing of the law that had been given  in Shushan to destroy them he hath given to him, to shew  Esther, and to declare [it] to her, and to lay a charge on her  to go in unto the king, to make supplication to him, and to  seek from before him, for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Hatach cometh in and declareth to Esther the words of  Mordecai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>and Esther speaketh to Hatach, and chargeth him for  Mordecai:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>`All servants of the king, and people of the provinces of  the king, do know that any man and woman, who cometh in unto  the king, unto the inner court, who is not called -- one law  [of] his [is] to put [them] to death, apart from him to whom  the king holdeth out the golden sceptre, then he hath lived;  and I -- I have not been called to come in unto the king these  thirty days.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And they declare to Mordecai the words of Esther,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>and Mordecai speaketh to send back unto Esther: `Do not  think in thy soul to be delivered [in] the house of the king,  more than all the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>but if thou keep entirely silent at this time, respite and  deliverance remaineth to the Jews from another place, and thou  and the house of thy fathers are destroyed; and who knoweth  whether for a time like this thou hast come to the kingdom?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>And Esther speaketh to send back unto Mordecai:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>`Go, gather all the Jews who are found in Shushan, and fast  for me, and do not eat nor drink three days, by night and by  day; also I and my young women do fast likewise, and so I go in  unto the king, that [is] not according to law, and when I have  perished -- I have perished.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>And Mordecai passeth on, and doth according to all that  Esther hath charged upon him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>And it cometh to pass on the third day, that Esther putteth  on royalty, and standeth in the inner-court of the house of the  king over-against the house of the king, and the king is  sitting on his royal throne, in the royal-house, over-against  the opening of the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>and it cometh to pass, at the king`s seeing Esther the queen  standing in the court, she hath received grace in his eyes, and  the king holdeth out to Esther the golden sceptre that [is] in  his hand, and Esther draweth near, and toucheth the top of the  sceptre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>And the king saith to her, `What -- to thee Esther, O queen?  and what thy request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is  given to thee.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>And Esther saith, `If unto the king [it be] good, the king  doth come in, and Haman, to-day, unto the banquet that I have  made for him;`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>and the king saith, `Haste ye Haman -- to do the word of  Esther;` and the king cometh in, and Haman, unto the banquet  that Esther hath made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And the king saith to Esther, during the banquet of wine,  `What [is] thy petition? and it is given to thee; and what thy  request? unto the half of the kingdom -- and it is done.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>And Esther answereth and saith, `My petition and my request  [is]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>if I have found grace in the eyes of the king, and if unto  the king [it be] good, to give my petition, and to perform my  request, the king doth come, and Haman, unto the banquet that I  make for them, and to-morrow I do according to the word of the  king.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>And Haman goeth forth on that day rejoicing and glad in  heart, and at Haman`s seeing Mordecai in the gate of the king,  and he hath not risen nor moved for him, then is Haman full of  fury against Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>And Haman forceth himself, and cometh in unto his house,  and sendeth, and bringeth in his friends, and Zeresh his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>and Haman recounteth to them the glory of his wealth, and  the abundance of his sons, and all that with which the king  made him great, and with which he lifted him up above the heads  and servants of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>And Haman saith, `Yea, Esther the queen brought none in  with the king, unto the feast that she made, except myself, and  also for to-morrow I am called to her, with the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>and all this is not profitable to me, during all the time  that I am seeing Mordecai the Jew sitting in the gate of the  king.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>And Zeresh his wife saith to him, and all his friends, `Let  them prepare a tree, in height fifty cubits, and in the morning  speak to the king, and they hang Mordecai on it, and go thou in  with the king unto the banquet rejoicing;` and the thing is  good before Haman, and he prepareth the tree.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>On that night hath the sleep of the king fled away, and he  saith to bring in the book of memorials of the Chronicles, and  they are read before the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>and it is found written that Mordecai had declared  concerning Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs of the king,  of the keepers of the threshold, who sought to put forth a hand  on king Ahasuerus.</verse>
