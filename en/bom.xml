        <description> The Book of Mormon is another witness that Jesus Christ really lived, that He was and is God’s Son. It contains the writings of ancient prophets. One of these, Lehi, lived in Jerusalem around 600 B.C. God commanded Lehi to lead a small group of people to the American continent. There they became a great civilization.</description>

        <title>filler fehlt/missing</title>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>Yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And I know that the record which I make is true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>For it came to pass in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father, Lehi, having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days); and in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>Wherefore it came to pass that my father, Lehi, as he went forth prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And it came to pass as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard he did quake and tremble exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the Spirit and the things which he had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And being thus overcome with the Spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the heavens open, and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And it came to pass that he saw One descending out of the midst of heaven, and he beheld that his luster was above that of the sun at noon-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars in the firmament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a book, and bade him that he should read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And he read, saying: Wo, wo, unto Jerusalem, for I have seen thine abominations! Yea, and many things did my father read concerning Jerusalem-that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof; many should perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And it came to pass that when my father had read and seen many great and marvelous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as: Great and marvelous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy are over all the inhabitants of the earth; and, because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen, yea, which the Lord had shown unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he prophesied and spake unto his children, of which I shall not make a full account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>But I shall make an account of my proceedings in my days. Behold, I make an abridgment of the record of my father, upon plates which I have made with mine own hands; wherefore, after I have abridged the record of my father then will I make an account of mine own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>Therefore, I would that ye should know, that after the Lord had shown so many marvelous things unto my father, Lehi, yea, concerning the destruction of Jerusalem, behold he went forth among the people, and began to prophesy and to declare unto them concerning the things which he had both seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And it came to pass that the Jews did mock him because of the things which he testified of them; for he truly testified of their wickedness and their abominations; and he testified that the things which he saw and heard, and also the things which he read in the book, manifested plainly of the coming of a Messiah, and also the redemption of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And when the Jews heard these things they were angry with him; yea, even as with the prophets of old, whom they had cast out, and stoned, and slain; and they also sought his life, that they might take it away. But behold, I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them mighty even unto the power of deliverance.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>FOR behold, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto my father, yea, even in a dream, and said unto him: Blessed art thou Lehi, because of the things which thou hast done; and because thou hast been faithful and declared unto this people the things which I commanded thee, behold, they seek to take away thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded my father, even in a dream, that he should take his family and depart into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And it came to pass that he was obedient unto the word of the Lord, wherefore he did as the Lord commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him, save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and departed into the wilderness.{600 B.C.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he traveled in the wilderness in the borders which are nearer the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother, Sariah, and my elder brothers, who were Laman, Lemuel, and Sam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>And it came to pass that when he had traveled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley by the side of a river of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and made an offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And it came to pass that he called the name of the river, Laman, and it emptied into the Red Sea; and the valley was in the borders near the mouth thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O that thou mightest be like unto this river, continually running into the fountain of all righteousness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto this valley, firm and steadfast, and immovable in keeping the commandments of the Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel; for behold they did murmur in many things against their father, because he was a visionary man, and had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, to perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And they were like unto the Jews who were at Jerusalem, who sought to take away the life of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, being filled with the Spirit, until their frames did shake before him. And he did confound them, that they durst not utter against him; wherefore, they did as he commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And my father dwelt in a tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, being exceedingly young, nevertheless being large in stature, and also having great desires to know of the mysteries of God, wherefore, I did cry unto the Lord; and behold he did visit me, and did soften my heart that I did believe all the words which had been spoken by my father; wherefore, I did not rebel against him like unto my brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>And I spake unto Sam, making known unto him the things which the Lord had manifested unto me by his Holy Spirit. And it came to pass that he believed in my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>But, behold, Laman and Lemuel would not hearken unto my words; and being grieved because of the hardness of their hearts I cried unto the Lord for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And it came to pass that the Lord spake unto me, saying: Blessed art thou, Nephi, because of thy faith, for thou hast sought me diligently, with lowliness of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper, and shall be led to a land of promise; yea, even a land which I have prepared for you; yea, a land which is choice above all other lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And inasmuch as thy brethren shall rebel against thee, they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And inasmuch as thou shalt keep my commandments, thou shalt be made a ruler and a teacher over thy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>For behold, in that day that they shall rebel against me, I will curse them even with a sore curse, and they shall have no power over thy seed except they shall rebel against me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>And if it so be that they rebel against me, they shall be a scourge unto thy seed, to stir them up in the ways of remembrance.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>AND it came to pass that I, Nephi, returned from speaking with the Lord, to the tent of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And it came to pass that he spake unto me, saying: Behold I have dreamed a dream, in the which the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brethren shall return to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>For behold, Laban hath the record of the Jews and also a genealogy of my forefathers, and they are engraven upon plates of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>Wherefore, the Lord hath commanded me that thou and thy brothers should go unto the house of Laban, and seek the records, and bring them down hither into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>And now, behold thy brothers murmur, saying it is a hard thing which I have required of them; but behold I have not required it of them, but it is a commandment of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>Therefore go, my son, and thou shalt be favored of the Lord, because thou hast not murmured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And it came to pass that when my father had heard these words he was exceedingly glad, for he knew that I had been blessed of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And I, Nephi, and my brethren took our journey in the wilderness, with our tents, to go up to the land of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And it came to pass that when we had gone up to the land of Jerusalem, I and my brethren did consult one with another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And we cast lots-who of us should go in unto the house of Laban. And it came to pass that the lot fell upon Laman; and Laman went in unto the house of Laban, and he talked with him as he sat in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And he desired of Laban the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, which contained the genealogy of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And behold, it came to pass that Laban was angry, and thrust him out from his presence; and he would not that he should have the records. Wherefore, he said unto him: Behold thou art a robber, and I will slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>But Laman fled out of his presence, and told the things which Laban had done, unto us. And we began to be exceedingly sorrowful, and my brethren were about to return unto my father in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>But behold I said unto them that: As the Lord liveth, and as we live, we will not go down unto our father in the wilderness until we have accomplished the thing which the Lord hath commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>Wherefore, let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; therefore let us go down to the land of our father's inheritance, for behold he left gold and silver, and all manner of riches. And all this he hath done because of the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>For he knew that Jerusalem must be destroyed, because of the wickedness of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>For behold, they have rejected the words of the prophets. Wherefore, if my father should dwell in the land after he hath been commanded to flee out of the land, behold, he would also perish. Wherefore, it must needs be that he flee out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>And behold, it is wisdom in God that we should obtain these records, that we may preserve unto our children the language of our fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And also that we may preserve unto them the words which have been spoken by the mouth of all the holy prophets, which have been delivered unto them by the Spirit and power of God, since the world began, even down unto this present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And it came to pass that after this manner of language did I persuade my brethren, that they might be faithful in keeping the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And it came to pass that we went down to the land of our inheritance, and we did gather together our gold, and our silver, and our precious things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>And after we had gathered these things together, we went up again unto the house of Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>And it came to pass that we went in unto Laban, and desired him that he would give unto us the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, for which we would give unto him our gold, and our silver, and all our precious things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.25'>And it came to pass that when Laban saw our property, and that it was exceedingly great, he did lust after it, insomuch that he thrust us out, and sent his servants to slay us, that he might obtain our property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.26'>And it came to pass that we did flee before the servants of Laban, and we were obliged to leave behind our property, and it fell into the hands of Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.27'>And it came to pass that we fled into the wilderness, and the servants of Laban did not overtake us, and we hid ourselves in the cavity of a rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.28'>And it came to pass that Laman was angry with me, and also with my father; and also was Lemuel, for he hearkened unto the words of Laman. Wherefore Laman and Lemuel did speak many hard words unto us, their younger brothers, and they did smite us even with a rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.29'>And it came to pass as they smote us with a rod, behold, an angel of the Lord came and stood before them, and he spake unto them, saying: Why do ye smite your younger brother with a rod? Know ye not that the Lord hath chosen him to be a ruler over you, and this because of your iniquities? Behold ye shall go up to Jerusalem again, and the Lord will deliver Laban into your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.30'>And after the angel had spoken unto us, he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.31'>And after the angel had departed, Laman and Lemuel again began to murmur, saying: How is it possible that the Lord will deliver Laban into our hands? Behold, he is a mighty man, and he can command fifty, yea, even he can slay fifty; then why not us?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>AND it came to pass that I spake unto my brethren, saying: Let us go up again unto Jerusalem, and let us be faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord; for behold he is mightier than all the earth, then why not mightier than Laban and his fifty, yea, or even than his tens of thousands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>Therefore let us go up; let us be strong like unto Moses; for he truly spake unto the waters of the Red Sea and they divided hither and thither, and our fathers came through, out of captivity, on dry ground, and the armies of Pharaoh did follow and were drowned in the waters of the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>Now behold ye know that this is true; and ye also know that an angel hath spoken unto you; wherefore can ye doubt? Let us go up; the Lord is able to deliver us, even as our fathers, and to destroy Laban, even as the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>Now when I had spoken these words, they were yet wroth, and did still continue to murmur; nevertheless they did follow me up until we came without the walls of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>And it was by night; and I caused that they should hide themselves without the walls. And after they had hid themselves, I, Nephi, crept into the city and went forth towards the house of Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And I was led by the Spirit, not knowing beforehand the things which I should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>Nevertheless I went forth, and as I came near unto the house of Laban I beheld a man, and he had fallen to the earth before me, for he was drunken with wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And when I came to him I found that it was Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And I beheld his sword, and I drew it forth from the sheath thereof; and the hilt thereof was of pure gold, and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine, and I saw that the blade thereof was of the most precious steel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And it came to pass that I was constrained by the Spirit that I should kill Laban; but I said in my heart: Never at any time have I shed the blood of man. And I shrunk and would that I might not slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And the Spirit said unto me again: Behold the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands. Yea, and I also knew that he had sought to take away mine own life; yea, and he would not hearken unto the commandments of the Lord; and he also had taken away our property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me again: Slay him, for the Lord hath delivered him into thy hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>And now, when I, Nephi, had heard these words, I remembered the words of the Lord which he spake unto me in the wilderness, saying that: Inasmuch as thy seed shall keep my commandments, they shall prosper in the land of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>Yea, and I also thought that they could not keep the commandments of the Lord according to the law of Moses, save they should have the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And I also knew that the law was engraven upon the plates of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And again, I knew that the Lord had delivered Laban into my hands for this cause-that I might obtain the records according to his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>Therefore I did obey the voice of the Spirit, and took Laban by the hair of the head, and I smote off his head with his own sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And after I had smitten off his head with his own sword, I took the garments of Laban and put them upon mine own body; yea, even every whit; and I did gird on his armor about my loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And after I had done this, I went forth unto the treasury of Laban. And as I went forth towards the treasury of Laban, behold, I saw the servant of Laban who had the keys of the treasury. And I commanded him in the voice of Laban, that he should go with me into the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And he supposed me to be his master, Laban, for he beheld the garments and also the sword girded about my loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And he spake unto me concerning the elders of the Jews, he knowing that his master, Laban, had been out by night among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And I spake unto him as if it had been Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>And I also spake unto him that I should carry the engravings, which were upon the plates of brass, to my elder brethren, who were without the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And I also bade him that he should follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And he, supposing that I spake of the brethren of the church, and that I was truly that Laban whom I had slain, wherefore he did follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.27'>And he spake unto me many times concerning the elders of the Jews, as I went forth unto my brethren, who were without the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.28'>And it came to pass that when Laman saw me he was exceedingly frightened, and also Lemuel and Sam. And they fled from before my presence; for they supposed it was Laban, and that he had slain me and had sought to take away their lives also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.29'>And it came to pass that I called after them, and they did hear me; wherefore they did cease to flee from my presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.30'>And it came to pass that when the servant of Laban beheld my brethren he began to tremble, and was about to flee from before me and return to the city of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.31'>And now I, Nephi, being a man large in stature, and also having received much strength of the Lord, therefore I did seize upon the servant of Laban, and held him, that he should not flee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.32'>And it came to pass that I spake with him, that if he would hearken unto my words, as the Lord liveth, and as I live, even so that if he would hearken unto our words, we would spare his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.33'>And I spake unto him, even with an oath, that he need not fear; that he should be a free man like unto us if he would go down in the wilderness with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.34'>And I also spake unto him, saying: Surely the Lord hath commanded us to do this thing; and shall we not be diligent in keeping the commandments of the Lord? Therefore, if thou wilt go down into the wilderness to my father thou shalt have place with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.35'>And it came to pass that Zoram did take courage at the words which I spake. Now Zoram was the name of the servant; and he promised that he would go down into the wilderness unto our father. Yea, and he also made an oath unto us that he would tarry with us from that time forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.36'>Now we were desirous that he should tarry with us for this cause, that the Jews might not know concerning our flight into the wilderness, lest they should pursue us and destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.37'>And it came to pass that when Zoram had made an oath unto us, our fears did cease concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.38'>And it came to pass that we took the plates of brass and the servant of Laban, and departed into the wilderness, and journeyed unto the tent of our father.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>AND it came to pass that after we had come down into the wilderness unto our father, behold, he was filled with joy, and also my mother, Sariah, was exceedingly glad, for she truly had mourned because of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.2'>For she had supposed that we had perished in the wilderness; and she also had complained against my father, telling him that he was a visionary man; saying: Behold thou hast led us forth from the land of our inheritance, and my sons are no more, and we perish in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.3'>And after this manner of language had my mother complained against my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.4'>And it had come to pass that my father spake unto her, saying: I know that I am a visionary man; for if I had not seen the things of God in a vision I should not have known the goodness of God, but had tarried at Jerusalem, and had perished with my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.5'>But behold, I have obtained a land of promise, in the which things I do rejoice; yea, and I know that the Lord will deliver my sons out of the hands of Laban, and bring them down again unto us in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.6'>And after this manner of language did my father, Lehi, comfort my mother, Sariah, concerning us, while we journeyed in the wilderness up to the land of Jerusalem, to obtain the record of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.7'>And when we had returned to the tent of my father, behold their joy was full, and my mother was comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.8'>And she spake, saying: Now I know of a surety that the Lord hath commanded my husband to flee into the wilderness; yea, and I also know of a surety that the Lord hath protected my sons, and delivered them out of the hands of Laban, and given them power whereby they could accomplish the thing which the Lord hath commanded them. And after this manner of language did she speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.9'>And it came to pass that they did rejoice exceedingly, and did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto the Lord; and they gave thanks unto the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.10'>And after they had given thanks unto the God of Israel, my father, Lehi, took the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass, and he did search them from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.11'>And he beheld that they did contain the five books of Moses, which gave an account of the creation of the world, and also of Adam and Eve, who were our first parents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.12'>And also a record of the Jews from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.13'>And also the prophecies of the holy prophets, from the beginning, even down to the commencement of the reign of Zedekiah; and also many prophecies which have been spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.14'>And it came to pass that my father, Lehi, also found upon the plates of brass a genealogy of his fathers; wherefore he knew that he was a descendant of Joseph; yea, even that Joseph who was the son of Jacob, who was sold into Egypt, and who was preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he might preserve his father, Jacob, and all his household from perishing with famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.15'>And they were also led out of captivity and out of the land of Egypt, by that same God who had preserved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.16'>And thus my father, Lehi, did discover the genealogy of his fathers. And Laban also was a descendant of Joseph, wherefore he and his fathers had kept the records.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.17'>And now when my father saw all these things, he was filled with the Spirit, and began to prophesy concerning his seed-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.18'>That these plates of brass should go forth unto all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people who were of his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.19'>Wherefore, he said that these plates of brass should never perish; neither should they be dimmed any more by time. And he prophesied many things concerning his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.20'>And it came to pass that thus far I and my father had kept the commandments wherewith the Lord had commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.21'>And we had obtained the records which the Lord had commanded us, and searched them and found that they were desirable; yea, even of great worth unto us, insomuch that we could preserve the commandments of the Lord unto our children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.22'>Wherefore, it was wisdom in the Lord that we should carry them with us, as we journeyed in the wilderness towards the land of promise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.6.2'>For it sufficeth me to say that we are descendants of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.3'>And it mattereth not to me that I am particular to give a full account of all the things of my father, for they cannot be written upon these plates, for I desire the room that I may write of the things of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.1'>AND now I would that ye might know, that after my father, Lehi, had made an end of prophesying concerning his seed, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto him again, saying that it was not meet for him, Lehi, that he should take his family into the wilderness alone; but that his sons should take daughters to wife, that they might raise up seed unto the Lord in the land of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.2'>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that I, Nephi, and my brethren, should again return unto the land of Jerusalem, and bring down Ishmael and his family into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.3'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did again, with my brethren, go forth into the wilderness to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.4'>And it came to pass that we went up unto the house of Ishmael, and we did gain favor in the sight of Ishmael, insomuch that we did speak unto him the words of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.5'>And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the heart of Ishmael, and also his household, insomuch that they took their journey with us down into the wilderness to the tent of our father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.6'>And it came to pass that as we journeyed in the wilderness, behold Laman and Lemuel, and two of the daughters of Ishmael, and the two sons of Ishmael and their families, did rebel against us; yea, against me, Nephi, and Sam, and their father, Ishmael, and his wife, and his three other daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.7'>And it came to pass in the which rebellion, they were desirous to return unto the land of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.8'>And now I, Nephi, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts, therefore I spake unto them, saying, yea, even unto Laman and unto Lemuel: Behold ye are mine elder brethren, and how is it that ye are so hard in your hearts, and so blind in your minds, that ye have need that I, your younger brother, should speak unto you, yea, and set an example for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.9'>How is it that ye have not hearkened unto the word of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.10'>How is it that ye have forgotten that ye have seen an angel of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.11'>Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten what great things the Lord hath done for us, in delivering us out of the hands of Laban, and also that we should obtain the record?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.12'>Yea, and how is it that ye have forgotten that the Lord is able to do all things according to his will, for the children of men, if it so be that they exercise faith in him? Wherefore, let us be faithful to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.13'>And if it so be that we are faithful to him, we shall obtain the land of promise; and ye shall know at some future period that the word of the Lord shall be fulfilled concerning the destruction of Jerusalem; for all things which the Lord hath spoken concerning the destruction of Jerusalem must be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.14'>For behold, the Spirit of the Lord ceaseth soon to strive with them; for behold, they have rejected the prophets, and Jeremiah have they cast into prison. And they have sought to take away the life of my father, insomuch that they have driven him out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.15'>Now behold, I say unto you that if ye will return unto Jerusalem ye shall also perish with them. And now, if ye have choice, go up to the land, and remember the words which I speak unto you, that if ye go ye will also perish; for thus the Spirit of the Lord constraineth me that I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.16'>And it came to pass that when I, Nephi, had spoken these words unto my brethren, they were angry with me. And it came to pass that they did lay their hands upon me, for behold, they were exceedingly wroth, and they did bind me with cords, for they sought to take away my life, that they might leave me in the wilderness to be devoured by wild beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.17'>But it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, according to my faith which is in thee, wilt thou deliver me from the hands of my brethren; yea, even give me strength that I may burst these bands with which I am bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.18'>And it came to pass that when I had said these words, behold, the bands were loosed from off my hands and feet, and I stood before my brethren, and I spake unto them again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.7.20'>And it came to pass that they were sorrowful, because of their wickedness, insomuch that they did bow down before me, and did plead with me that I would forgive them of the thing that they had done against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.21'>And it came to pass that I did frankly forgive them all that they had done, and I did exhort them that they would pray unto the Lord their God for forgiveness. And it came to pass that they did so. And after they had done praying unto the Lord we did again travel on our journey towards the tent of our father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.22'>And it came to pass that we did come down unto the tent of our father. And after I and my brethren and all the house of Ishmael had come down unto the tent of my father, they did give thanks unto the Lord their God; and they did offer sacrifice and burnt offerings unto him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.2'>And it came to pass that while my father tarried in the wilderness he spake unto us, saying: Behold, I have dreamed a dream; or, in other words, I have seen a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.3'>And behold, because of the thing which I have seen, I have reason to rejoice in the Lord because of Nephi and also of Sam; for I have reason to suppose that they, and also many of their seed, will be saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.11'>And it came to pass that I did go forth and partake of the fruit thereof; and I beheld that it was most sweet, above all that I ever before tasted. Yea, and I beheld that the fruit thereof was white, to exceed all the whiteness that I had ever seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.12'>And as I partook of the fruit thereof it filled my soul with exceedingly great joy; wherefore, I began to be desirous that my family should partake of it also; for I knew that it was desirable above all other fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.13'>And as I cast my eyes round about, that perhaps I might discover my family also, I beheld a river of water; and it ran along, and it was near the tree of which I was partaking the fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.14'>And I looked to behold from whence it came; and I saw the head thereof a little way off; and at the head thereof I beheld your mother Sariah, and Sam, and Nephi; and they stood as if they knew not whither they should go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.15'>And it came to pass that I beckoned unto them; and I also did say unto them with a loud voice that they should come unto me, and partake of the fruit, which was desirable above all other fruit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.19'>And I beheld a rod of iron, and it extended along the bank of the river, and led to the tree by which I stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.20'>And I also beheld a strait and narrow path, which came along by the rod of iron, even to the tree by which I stood; and it also led by the head of the fountain, unto a large and spacious field, as if it had been a world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.21'>And I saw numberless concourses of people, many of whom were pressing forward, that they might obtain the path which led unto the tree by which I stood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.25'>And after they had partaken of the fruit of the tree they did cast their eyes about as if they were ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.26'>And I also cast my eyes round about, and beheld, on the other side of the river of water, a great and spacious building; and it stood as it were in the air, high above the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.27'>And it was filled with people, both old and young, both male and female; and their manner of dress was exceedingly fine; and they were in the attitude of mocking and pointing their fingers towards those who had come at and were partaking of the fruit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.37'>And he did exhort them then with all the feeling of a tender parent, that they would hearken to his words, that perhaps the Lord would be merciful to them, and not cast them off; yea, my father did preach unto them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.10.8'>Yea, even he should go forth and cry in the wilderness: Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make his paths straight; for there standeth one among you whom ye know not; and he is mightier than I, whose shoe's latchet I am not worthy to unloose. And much spake my father concerning this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.10.9'>And my father said he should baptize in Bethabara, beyond Jordan; and he also said he should baptize with water; even that he should baptize the Messiah with water.</verse>

And after they had slain the Messiah, who should come, and after he had been slain he should rise from the dead, and should make himself manifest, by the Holy Ghost, unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.10.12'>Yea, even my father spake much concerning the Gentiles, and also concerning the house of Israel, that they should be compared like unto an olive-tree, whose branches should be broken off and should be scattered upon all the face of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.11.1'>FOR it came to pass after I had desired to know the things that my father had seen, and believing that the Lord was able to make them known unto me, as I sat pondering in mine heart I was caught away in the Spirit of the Lord, yea, into an exceedingly high mountain, which I never had before seen, and upon which I never had before set my foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.2'>And the Spirit said unto me: Behold, what desirest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.3'>And I said: I desire to behold the things which my father saw.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.11.8'>And it came to pass that the Spirit said unto me: Look!

        <verse osisID='Gen.11.11'>And I said unto him: To know the interpretation thereof-for I spake unto him as a man speaketh; for I beheld that he was in the form of a man; yet nevertheless, I knew that it was the Spirit of the Lord; and he spake unto me as a man speaketh with another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.12'>And it came to pass that he said unto me: Look! And I looked as if to look upon him, and I saw him not; for he had gone from before my presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.13'>And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the great city of Jerusalem, and also other cities. And I beheld the city of Nazareth; and in the city of Nazareth I beheld a virgin, and she was exceedingly fair and white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.14'>And it came to pass that I saw the heavens open; and an angel came down and stood before me; and he said unto me: Nephi, what beholdest thou?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.11.24'>And after he had said these words, he said unto me: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Son of God going forth among the children of men; and I saw many fall down at his feet and worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.25'>And it came to pass that I beheld that the rod of iron, which my father had seen, was the word of God, which led to the fountain of living waters, or to the tree of life; which waters are a representation of the love of God; and I also beheld that the tree of life was a representation of the love of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.26'>And the angel said unto me again: Look and behold the condescension of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.27'>And I looked and beheld the Redeemer of the world, of whom my father had spoken; and I also beheld the prophet who should prepare the way before him. And the Lamb of God went forth and was baptized of him; and after he was baptized, I beheld the heavens open, and the Holy Ghost come down out of heaven and abide upon him in the form of a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.28'>And I beheld that he went forth ministering unto the people, in power and great glory; and the multitudes were gathered together to hear him; and I beheld that they cast him out from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.29'>And I also beheld twelve others following him. And it came to pass that they were carried away in the Spirit from before my face, and I saw them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.30'>And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the heavens open again, and I saw angels descending upon the children of men; and they did minister unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.31'>And he spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked, and I beheld the Lamb of God going forth among the children of men. And I beheld multitudes of people who were sick, and who were afflicted with all manner of diseases, and with devils and unclean spirits; and the angel spake and showed all these things unto me. And they were healed by the power of the Lamb of God; and the devils and the unclean spirits were cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.32'>And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me again, saying: Look! And I looked and beheld the Lamb of God, that he was taken by the people; yea, the Son of the everlasting God was judged of the world; and I saw and bear record.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.33'>And I, Nephi, saw that he was lifted up upon the cross and slain for the sins of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.34'>And after he was slain I saw the multitudes of the earth, that they were gathered together to fight against the apostles of the Lamb; for thus were the twelve called by the angel of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.35'>And the multitude of the earth was gathered together; and I beheld that they were in a large and spacious building, like unto the building which my father saw. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Behold the world and the wisdom thereof; yea, behold the house of Israel hath gathered together to fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.11.36'>And it came to pass that I saw and bear record, that the great and spacious building was the pride of the world; and it fell, and the fall thereof was exceedingly great. And the angel of the Lord spake unto me again, saying: Thus shall be the destruction of all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people, that shall fight against the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.14.11'>And it came to pass that I looked and beheld the whore of all the earth, and she sat upon many waters; and she had dominion over all the earth, among all nations, kindreds, tongues, and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.12'>And it came to pass that I beheld the church of the Lamb of God, and its numbers were few, because of the wickedness and abominations of the whore who sat upon many waters; nevertheless, I beheld that the church of the Lamb, who were the saints of God, were also upon all the face of the earth; and their dominions upon the face of the earth were small, because of the wickedness of the great whore whom I saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.13'>And it came to pass that I beheld that the great mother of abominations did gather together multitudes upon the face of all the earth, among all the nations of the Gentiles, to fight against the Lamb of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.14'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, beheld the power of the Lamb of God, that it descended upon the saints of the church of the Lamb, and upon the covenant people of the Lord, who were scattered upon all the face of the earth; and they were armed with righteousness and with the power of God in great glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.15'>And it came to pass that I beheld that the wrath of God was poured out upon that great and abominable church, insomuch that there were wars and rumors of wars among all the nations and kindreds of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.16'>And as there began to be wars and rumors of wars among all the nations which belonged to the mother of abominations, the angel spake unto me, saying: Behold, the wrath of God is upon the mother of harlots; and behold, thou seest all these things-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.17'>And when the day cometh that the wrath of God is poured out upon the mother of harlots, which is the great and abominable church of all the earth, whose founder is the devil, then, at that day, the work of the Father shall commence, in preparing the way for the fulfilling of his covenants, which he hath made to his people who are of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.18'>And it came to pass that the angel spake unto me, saying: Look!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.19'>And I looked and beheld a man, and he was dressed in a white robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.20'>And the angel said unto me: Behold one of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.14.26'>And also others who have been, to them hath he shown all things, and they have written them; and they are sealed up to come forth in their purity, according to the truth which is in the Lamb, in the own due time of the Lord, unto the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.14.27'>And I, Nephi, heard and bear record, that the name of the apostle of the Lamb was John, according to the word of the angel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.15.18'>Wherefore, our father hath not spoken of our seed alone, but also of all the house of Israel, pointing to the covenant which should be fulfilled in the latter days; which covenant the Lord made to our father Abraham, saying: In thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.15.19'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, spake much unto them concerning these things; yea, I spake unto them concerning the restoration of the Jews in the latter days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.15.34'>But behold, I say unto you, the kingdom of God is not filthy, and there cannot any unclean thing enter into the kingdom of God; wherefore there must needs be a place of filthiness prepared for that which is filthy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.16.15'>And it came to pass that we did travel for the space of many days, slaying food by the way, with our bows and our arrows and our stones and our slings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.16.19'>And it came to pass that we did return without food to our families, and being much fatigued, because of their journeying, they did suffer much for the want of food.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.16.23'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did make out of wood a bow, and out of a straight stick, an arrow; wherefore, I did arm myself with a bow and an arrow, with a sling and with stones. And I said unto my father: Whither shall I go to obtain food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.24'>And it came to pass that he did inquire of the Lord, for they had humbled themselves because of my words; for I did say many things unto them in the energy of my soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.25'>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came unto my father; and he was truly chastened because of his murmuring against the Lord, insomuch that he was brought down into the depths of sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.26'>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord said unto him: Look upon the ball, and behold the things which are written.</verse>

And thus we see that by small means the Lord can bring about great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.30'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did go forth up into the top of the mountain, according to the directions which were given upon the ball.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.16.33'>And it came to pass that we did again take our journey, traveling nearly the same course as in the beginning; and after we had traveled for the space of many days we did pitch our tents again, that we might tarry for the space of a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.34'>And it came to pass that Ishmael died, and was buried in the place which was called Nahom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.35'>And it came to pass that the daughters of Ishmael did mourn exceedingly, because of the loss of their father, and because of their afflictions in the wilderness; and they did murmur against my father, because he had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, saying: Our father is dead; yea, and we have wandered much in the wilderness, and we have suffered much affliction, hunger, thirst, and fatigue; and after all these sufferings we must perish in the wilderness with hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.36'>And thus they did murmur against my father, and also against me; and they were desirous to return again to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.37'>And Laman said unto Lemuel and also unto the sons of Ishmael: Behold, let us slay our father, and also our brother Nephi, who has taken it upon him to be our ruler and our teacher, who are his elder brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.38'>Now, he says that the Lord has talked with him, and also that angels have ministered unto him. But behold, we know that he lies unto us; and he tells us these things, and he worketh many things by his cunning arts, that he may deceive our eyes, thinking, perhaps, that he may lead us away into some strange wilderness; and after he has led us away, he has thought to make himself a king and a ruler over us, that he may do with us according to his will and pleasure. And after this manner did my brother Laman stir up their hearts to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.16.39'>And it came to pass that the Lord was with us, yea, even the voice of the Lord came and did speak many words unto them, and did chasten them exceedingly; and after they were chastened by the voice of the Lord they did turn away their anger, and did repent of their sins, insomuch that the Lord did bless us again with food, that we did not perish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>AND now, Jacob, I speak unto you: Thou art my first-born in the days of my tribulation in the wilderness. And behold, in thy childhood thou hast suffered afflictions and much sorrow, because of the rudeness of thy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>Nevertheless, Jacob, my first-born in the wilderness, thou knowest the greatness of God; and he shall consecrate thine afflictions for thy gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>Wherefore, thy soul shall be blessed, and thou shalt dwell safely with thy brother, Nephi; and thy days shall be spent in the service of thy God. Wherefore, I know that thou art redeemed, because of the righteousness of thy Redeemer; for thou hast beheld that in the fulness of time he cometh to bring salvation unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>And thou hast beheld in thy youth his glory; wherefore, thou art blessed even as they unto whom he shall minister in the flesh; for the Spirit is the same, yesterday, today, and forever. And the way is prepared from the fall of man, and salvation is free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. And by the law no flesh is justified; or, by the law men are cut off. Yea, by the temporal law they were cut off; and also, by the spiritual law they perish from that which is good, and become miserable forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>Wherefore, redemption cometh in and through the Holy Messiah; for he is full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>Behold, he offereth himself a sacrifice for sin, to answer the ends of the law, unto all those who have a broken heart and a contrite spirit; and unto none else can the ends of the law be answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>Wherefore, how great the importance to make these things known unto the inhabitants of the earth, that they may know that there is no flesh that can dwell in the presence of God, save it be through the merits, and mercy, and grace of the Holy Messiah, who layeth down his life according to the flesh, and taketh it again by the power of the Spirit, that he may bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, being the first that should rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>Wherefore, he is the firstfruits unto God, inasmuch as he shall make intercession for all the children of men; and they that believe in him shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And because of the intercession for all, all men come unto God; wherefore, they stand in the presence of him, to be judged of him according to the truth and holiness which is in him. Wherefore, the ends of the law which the Holy One hath given, unto the inflicting of the punishment which is affixed, which punishment that is affixed is in opposition to that of the happiness which is affixed, to answer the ends of the atonement-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>For it must needs be, that there is an opposition in all things. If not so, my first-born in the wilderness, righteousness could not be brought to pass, neither wickedness, neither holiness nor misery, neither good nor bad. Wherefore, all things must needs be a compound in one; wherefore, if it should be one body it must needs remain as dead, having no life neither death, nor corruption nor incorruption, happiness nor misery, neither sense nor insensibility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>Wherefore, it must needs have been created for a thing of naught; wherefore there would have been no purpose in the end of its creation. Wherefore, this thing must needs destroy the wisdom of God and his eternal purposes, and also the power, and the mercy, and the justice of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And if ye shall say there is no law, ye shall also say there is no sin. If ye shall say there is no sin, ye shall also say there is no righteousness. And if there be no righteousness there be no happiness. And if there be no righteousness nor happiness there be no punishment nor misery. And if these things are not there is no God. And if there is no God we are not, neither the earth; for there could have been no creation of things, neither to act nor to be acted upon; wherefore, all things must have vanished away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And now, my sons, I speak unto you these things for your profit and learning; for there is a God, and he hath created all things, both the heavens and the earth, and all things that in them are, both things to act and things to be acted upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>And to bring about his eternal purposes in the end of man, after he had created our first parents, and the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air, and in fine, all things which are created, it must needs be that there was an opposition; even the forbidden fruit in opposition to the tree of life; the one being sweet and the other bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>Wherefore, the Lord God gave unto man that he should act for himself. Wherefore, man could not act for himself save it should be that he was enticed by the one or the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>And I, Lehi, according to the things which I have read, must needs suppose that an angel of God, according to that which is written, had fallen from heaven; wherefore, he became a devil, having sought that which was evil before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And because he had fallen from heaven, and had become miserable forever, he sought also the misery of all mankind. Wherefore, he said unto Eve, yea, even that old serpent, who is the devil, who is the father of all lies, wherefore he said: Partake of the forbidden fruit, and ye shall not die, but ye shall be as God, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And after Adam and Eve had partaken of the forbidden fruit they were driven out of the garden of Eden, to till the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And they have brought forth children; yea, even the family of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And the days of the children of men were prolonged, according to the will of God, that they might repent while in the flesh; wherefore, their state became a state of probation, and their time was lengthened, according to the commandments which the Lord God gave unto the children of men. For he gave commandment that all men must repent; for he showed unto all men that they were lost, because of the transgression of their parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And now, behold, if Adam had not transgressed he would not have fallen, but he would have remained in the garden of Eden. And all things which were created must have remained in the same state in which they were after they were created; and they must have remained forever, and had no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And they would have had no children; wherefore they would have remained in a state of innocence, having no joy, for they knew no misery; doing no good, for they knew no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>But behold, all things have been done in the wisdom of him who knoweth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.26'>And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, save it be by the punishment of the law at the great and last day, according to the commandments which God hath given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.27'>Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; for he seeketh that all men might be miserable like unto himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.28'>And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.29'>And not choose eternal death, according to the will of the flesh and the evil which is therein, which giveth the spirit of the devil power to captivate, to bring you down to hell, that he may reign over you in his own kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.30'>I have spoken these few words unto you all, my sons, in the last days of my probation; and I have chosen the good part, according to the words of the prophet. And I have none other object save it be the everlasting welfare of your souls. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>AND now I speak unto you, Joseph, my last-born. Thou wast born in the wilderness of mine afflictions; yea, in the days of my greatest sorrow did thy mother bear thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And may the Lord consecrate also unto thee this land, which is a most precious land, for thine inheritance and the inheritance of thy seed with thy brethren, for thy security forever, if it so be that ye shall keep the commandments of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And now, Joseph, my last-born, whom I have brought out of the wilderness of mine afflictions, may the Lord bless thee forever, for thy seed shall not utterly be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>For behold, thou art the fruit of my loins; and I am a descendant of Joseph who was carried captive into Egypt. And great were the covenants of the Lord which he made unto Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>Wherefore, Joseph truly saw our day. And he obtained a promise of the Lord, that out of the fruit of his loins the Lord God would raise up a righteous branch unto the house of Israel; not the Messiah, but a branch which was to be broken off, nevertheless, to be remembered in the covenants of the Lord that the Messiah should be made manifest unto them in the latter days, in the spirit of power, unto the bringing of them out of darkness unto light-yea, out of hidden darkness and out of captivity unto freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>For Joseph truly testified, saying: A seer shall the Lord my God raise up, who shall be a choice seer unto the fruit of my loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>Yea, Joseph truly said: Thus saith the Lord unto me: A choice seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and he shall be esteemed highly among the fruit of thy loins. And unto him will I give commandment that he shall do a work for the fruit of thy loins, his brethren, which shall be of great worth unto them, even to the bringing of them to the knowledge of the covenants which I have made with thy fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>And I will give unto him a commandment that he shall do none other work, save the work which I shall command him. And I will make him great in mine eyes; for he shall do my work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>And he shall be great like unto Moses, whom I have said I would raise up unto you, to deliver my people, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>And Moses will I raise up, to deliver thy people out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>But a seer will I raise up out of the fruit of thy loins; and unto him will I give power to bring forth my word unto the seed of thy loins-and not to the bringing forth my word only, saith the Lord, but to the convincing them of my word, which shall have already gone forth among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>Wherefore, the fruit of thy loins shall write; and the fruit of the loins of Judah shall write; and that which shall be written by the fruit of thy loins, and also that which shall be written by the fruit of the loins of Judah, shall grow together, unto the confounding of false doctrines and laying down of contentions, and establishing peace among the fruit of thy loins, and bringing them to the knowledge of their fathers in the latter days, and also to the knowledge of my covenants, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>And out of weakness he shall be made strong, in that day when my work shall commence among all my people, unto the restoring thee, O house of Israel, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And thus prophesied Joseph, saying: Behold, that seer will the Lord bless; and they that seek to destroy him shall be confounded; for this promise, which I have obtained of the Lord, of the fruit of my loins, shall be fulfilled. Behold, I am sure of the fulfilling of this promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And his name shall be called after me; and it shall be after the name of his father. And he shall be like unto me; for the thing, which the Lord shall bring forth by his hand, by the power of the Lord shall bring my people unto salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Yea, thus prophesied Joseph: I am sure of this thing, even as I am sure of the promise of Moses; for the Lord hath said unto me, I will preserve thy seed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>And the Lord hath said: I will raise up a Moses; and I will give power unto him in a rod; and I will give judgment unto him in writing. Yet I will not loose his tongue, that he shall speak much, for I will not make him mighty in speaking. But I will write unto him my law, by the finger of mine own hand; and I will make a spokesman for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And the Lord said unto me also: I will raise up unto the fruit of thy loins; and I will make for him a spokesman. And I, behold, I will give unto him that he shall write the writing of the fruit of thy loins, unto the fruit of thy loins; and the spokesman of thy loins shall declare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>And the words which he shall write shall be the words which are expedient in my wisdom should go forth unto the fruit of thy loins. And it shall be as if the fruit of thy loins had cried unto them from the dust; for I know their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>And they shall cry from the dust; yea, even repentance unto their brethren, even after many generations have gone by them. And it shall come to pass that their cry shall go, even according to the simpleness of their words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>Because of their faith their words shall proceed forth out of my mouth unto their brethren who are the fruit of thy loins; and the weakness of their words will I make strong in their faith, unto the remembering of my covenant which I made unto thy fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>And now, behold, my son Joseph, after this manner did my father of old prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.23'>Wherefore, because of this covenant thou art blessed; for thy seed shall not be destroyed, for they shall hearken unto the words of the book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.24'>And there shall rise up one mighty among them, who shall do much good, both in word and in deed, being an instrument in the hands of God, with exceeding faith, to work mighty wonders, and do that thing which is great in the sight of God, unto the bringing to pass much restoration unto the house of Israel, and unto the seed of thy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.25'>And now, blessed art thou, Joseph. Behold, thou art little; wherefore hearken unto the words of thy brother, Nephi, and it shall be done unto thee even according to the words which I have spoken. Remember the words of thy dying father. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>AND now, I, Nephi, speak concerning the prophecies of which my father hath spoken, concerning Joseph, who was carried into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>For behold, he truly prophesied concerning all his seed. And the prophecies which he wrote, there are not many greater. And he prophesied concerning us, and our future generations; and they are written upon the plates of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>Wherefore, after my father had made an end of speaking concerning the prophecies of Joseph, he called the children of Laman, his sons, and his daughters, and said unto them: Behold, my sons, and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my first-born, I would that ye should give ear unto my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>For the Lord God hath said that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from my presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>But behold, my sons and my daughters, I cannot go down to my grave save I should leave a blessing upon you; for behold, I know that if ye are brought up in the way ye should go ye will not depart from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>Wherefore, if ye are cursed, behold, I leave my blessing upon you, that the cursing may be taken from you and be answered upon the heads of your parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>Wherefore, because of my blessing the Lord God will not suffer that ye shall perish; wherefore, he will be merciful unto you and unto your seed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>And it came to pass that after my father had made an end of speaking to the sons and daughters of Laman, he caused the sons and daughters of Lemuel to be brought before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>And he spake unto them, saying: Behold, my sons and my daughters, who are the sons and the daughters of my second son; behold I leave unto you the same blessing which I left unto the sons and daughters of Laman; wherefore, thou shalt not utterly be destroyed; but in the end thy seed shall be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>And it came to pass that when my father had made an end of speaking unto them, behold, he spake unto the sons of Ishmael, yea, and even all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>And after he had made an end of speaking unto them, he spake unto Sam, saying: Blessed art thou, and thy seed; for thou shalt inherit the land like unto thy brother Nephi. And thy seed shall be numbered with his seed; and thou shalt be even like unto thy brother, and thy seed like unto his seed; and thou shalt be blessed in all thy days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>And it came to pass after my father, Lehi, had spoken unto all his household, according to the feelings of his heart and the Spirit of the Lord which was in him, he waxed old. And it came to pass that he died, and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>And it came to pass that not many days after his death, Laman and Lemuel and the sons of Ishmael were angry with me because of the admonitions of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>For I, Nephi, was constrained to speak unto them, according to his word; for I had spoken many things unto them, and also my father, before his death; many of which sayings are written upon mine other plates; for a more history part are written upon mine other plates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>And upon these I write the things of my soul, and many of the scriptures which are engraven upon the plates of brass. For my soul delighteth in the scriptures, and my heart pondereth them, and writeth them for the learning and the profit of my children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>Behold, my soul delighteth in the things of the Lord; and my heart pondereth continually upon the things which I have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>Nevertheless, notwithstanding the great goodness of the Lord, in showing me his great and marvelous works, my heart exclaimeth: O wretched man that I am! Yea, my heart sorroweth because of my flesh; my soul grieveth because of mine iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>I am encompassed about, because of the temptations and the sins which do so easily beset me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>And when I desire to rejoice, my heart groaneth because of my sins; nevertheless, I know in whom I have trusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>My God hath been my support; he hath led me through mine afflictions in the wilderness; and he hath preserved me upon the waters of the great deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>He hath filled me with his love, even unto the consuming of my flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>He hath confounded mine enemies, unto the causing of them to quake before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>Behold, he hath heard my cry by day, and he hath given me knowledge by visions in the night-time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And by day have I waxed bold in mighty prayer before him; yea, my voice have I sent up on high; and angels came down and ministered unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>And upon the wings of his Spirit hath my body been carried away upon exceedingly high mountains. And mine eyes have beheld great things, yea, even too great for man; therefore I was bidden that I should not write them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>O then, if I have seen so great things, if the Lord in his condescension unto the children of men hath visited men in so much mercy, why should my heart weep and my soul linger in the valley of sorrow, and my flesh waste away, and my strength slacken, because of mine afflictions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And why should I yield to sin, because of my flesh? Yea, why should I give way to temptations, that the evil one have place in my heart to destroy my peace and afflict my soul? Why am I angry because of mine enemy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>Awake, my soul! No longer droop in sin. Rejoice, O my heart, and give place no more for the enemy of my soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>Do not anger again because of mine enemies. Do not slacken my strength because of mine afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>Rejoice, O my heart, and cry unto the Lord, and say: O Lord, I will praise thee forever; yea, my soul will rejoice in thee, my God, and the rock of my salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>O Lord, wilt thou redeem my soul? Wilt thou deliver me out of the hands of mine enemies? Wilt thou make me that I may shake at the appearance of sin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.32'>May the gates of hell be shut continually before me, because that my heart is broken and my spirit is contrite! O Lord, wilt thou not shut the gates of thy righteousness before me, that I may walk in the path of the low valley, that I may be strict in the plain road!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.33'>O Lord, wilt thou encircle me around in the robe of thy righteousness! O Lord, wilt thou make a way for mine escape before mine enemies! Wilt thou make my path straight before me! Wilt thou not place a stumbling block in my way-but that thou wouldst clear my way before me, and hedge not up my way, but the ways of mine enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.34'>O Lord, I have trusted in thee, and I will trust in thee forever. I will not put my trust in the arm of flesh; for I know that cursed is he that putteth his trust in the arm of flesh. Yea, cursed is he that putteth his trust in man or maketh flesh his arm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.35'>Yea, I know that God will give liberally to him that asketh. Yea, my God will give me, if I ask not amiss; therefore I will lift up my voice unto thee; yea, I will cry unto thee, my God, the rock of my righteousness. Behold, my voice shall forever ascend up unto thee, my rock and mine everlasting God. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>BEHOLD, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cry much unto the Lord my God, because of the anger of my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>But behold, their anger did increase against me, insomuch that they did seek to take away my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>Yea, they did murmur against me, saying: Our younger brother thinks to rule over us; and we have had much trial because of him; wherefore, now let us slay him, that we may not be afflicted more because of his words. For behold, we will not have him to be our ruler; for it belongs unto us, who are the elder brethren, to rule over this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>Now I do not write upon these plates all the words which they murmured against me. But it sufficeth me to say, that they did seek to take away my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And it came to pass that the Lord did warn me, that I, Nephi, should depart from them and flee into the wilderness, and all those who would go with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>Wherefore, it came to pass that I, Nephi, did take my family, and also Zoram and his family, and Sam, mine elder brother and his family, and Jacob and Joseph, my younger brethren, and also my sisters, and all those who would go with me. And all those who would go with me were those who believed in the warnings and the revelations of God; wherefore, they did hearken unto my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>And we did take our tents and whatsoever things were possible for us, and did journey in the wilderness for the space of many days. And after we had journeyed for the space of many days we did pitch our tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>And my people would that we should call the name of the place Nephi; wherefore, we did call it Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>And all those who were with me did take upon them to call themselves the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>And we did observe to keep the judgments, and the statutes, and the commandments of the Lord in all things, according to the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>And the Lord was with us; and we did prosper exceedingly; for we did sow seed, and we did reap again in abundance. And we began to raise flocks, and herds, and animals of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>And I, Nephi, had also brought the records which were engraven upon the plates of brass; and also the ball, or compass, which was prepared for my father by the hand of the Lord, according to that which is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>And it came to pass that we began to prosper exceedingly, and to multiply in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>And I, Nephi, did take the sword of Laban, and after the manner of it did make many swords, lest by any means the people who were now called Lamanites should come upon us and destroy us; for I knew their hatred towards me and my children and those who were called my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>And I did teach my people to build buildings, and to work in all manner of wood, and of iron, and of copper, and of brass, and of steel, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious ores, which were in great abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>And I, Nephi, did build a temple; and I did construct it after the manner of the temple of Solomon save it were not built of so many precious things; for they were not to be found upon the land, wherefore, it could not be built like unto Solomon's temple. But the manner of the construction was like unto the temple of Solomon; and the workmanship thereof was exceedingly fine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.17'>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, did cause my people to be industrious, and to labor with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.18'>And it came to pass that they would that I should be their king. But I, Nephi, was desirous that they should have no king; nevertheless, I did for them according to that which was in my power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.19'>And behold, the words of the Lord had been fulfilled unto my brethren, which he spake concerning them, that I should be their ruler and their teacher. Wherefore, I had been their ruler and their teacher, according to the commandments of the Lord, until the time they sought to take away my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.20'>Wherefore, the word of the Lord was fulfilled which he spake unto me, saying that: Inasmuch as they will not hearken unto thy words they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord. And behold, they were cut off from his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.21'>And he had caused the cursing to come upon them, yea, even a sore cursing, because of their iniquity. For behold, they had hardened their hearts against him, that they had become like unto a flint; wherefore, as they were white, and exceedingly fair and delightsome, that they might not be enticing unto my people the Lord God did cause a skin of blackness to come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.22'>And thus saith the Lord God: I will cause that they shall be loathsome unto thy people, save they shall repent of their iniquities.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.5.31'>Wherefore, I, Nephi, to be obedient to the commandments of the Lord, went and made these plates upon which I have engraven these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.32'>And I engraved that which is pleasing unto God. And if my people are pleased with the things of God they will be pleased with mine engravings which are upon these plates.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.6'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.1'>THE words of Jacob, the brother of Nephi, which he spake unto the people of Nephi:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.2'>Behold, my beloved brethren, I, Jacob, having been called of God, and ordained after the manner of his holy order, and having been consecrated by my brother Nephi, unto whom ye look as a king or a protector, and on whom ye depend for safety, behold ye know that I have spoken unto you exceedingly many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.3'>Nevertheless, I speak unto you again; for I am desirous for the welfare of your souls. Yea, mine anxiety is great for you; and ye yourselves know that it ever has been. For I have exhorted you with all diligence; and I have taught you the words of my father; and I have spoken unto you concerning all things which are written, from the creation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.4'>And now, behold, I would speak unto you concerning things which are, and which are to come; wherefore, I will read you the words of Isaiah. And they are the words which my brother has desired that I should speak unto you. And I speak unto you for your sakes, that ye may learn and glorify the name of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.5'>And now, the words which I shall read are they which Isaiah spake concerning all the house of Israel; wherefore, they may be likened unto you, for ye are of the house of Israel. And there are many things which have been spoken by Isaiah which may be likened unto you, because ye are of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.6'>And now, these are the words: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will lift up mine hand to the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people; and they shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be carried upon their shoulders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.7'>And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy nursing mothers; they shall bow down to thee with their faces towards the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord; for they shall not be ashamed that wait for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.8'>And now I, Jacob, would speak somewhat concerning these words. For behold, the Lord has shown me that those who were at Jerusalem, from whence we came, have been slain and carried away captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.9'>Nevertheless, the Lord has shown unto me that they should return again. And he also has shown unto me that the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, should manifest himself unto them in the flesh; and after he should manifest himself they should scourge him and crucify him, according to the words of the angel who spake it unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.10'>And after they have hardened their hearts and stiffened their necks against the Holy One of Israel, behold, the judgments of the Holy One of Israel shall come upon them. And the day cometh that they shall be smitten and afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.11'>Wherefore, after they are driven to and fro, for thus saith the angel, many shall be afflicted in the flesh, and shall not be suffered to perish, because of the prayers of the faithful; they shall be scattered, and smitten, and hated; nevertheless, the Lord will be merciful unto them, that when they shall come to the knowledge of their Redeemer, they shall be gathered together again to the lands of their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.12'>And blessed are the Gentiles, they of whom the prophet has written; for behold, if it so be that they shall repent and fight not against Zion, and do not unite themselves to that great and abominable church, they shall be saved; for the Lord God will fulfil his covenants which he has made unto his children; and for this cause the prophet has written these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.13'>Wherefore, they that fight against Zion and the covenant people of the Lord shall lick up the dust of their feet; and the people of the Lord shall not be ashamed. For the people of the Lord are they who wait for him; for they still wait for the coming of the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.14'>And behold, according to the words of the prophet, the Messiah will set himself again the second time to recover them; wherefore, he will manifest himself unto them in power and great glory, unto the destruction of their enemies, when that day cometh when they shall believe in him; and none will he destroy that believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.15'>And they that believe not in him shall be destroyed, both by fire, and by tempest, and by earthquakes, and by bloodsheds, and by pestilence, and by famine. And they shall know that the Lord is God, the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.16'>For shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive delivered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.17'>But thus saith the Lord: Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be delivered; for the Mighty God shall deliver his covenant people. For thus saith the Lord: I will contend with them that contendeth with thee-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.18'>And I will feed them that oppress thee, with their own flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood as with sweet wine; and all flesh shall know that I the Lord am thy Savior and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</verse>

Behold, for your iniquities have ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother put away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.2'>That he has spoken unto the Jews, by the mouth of his holy prophets, even from the beginning down, from generation to generation, until the time comes that they shall be restored to the true church and fold of God; when they shall be gathered home to the lands of their inheritance, and shall be established in all their lands of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.3'>Behold, my beloved brethren, I speak unto you these things that ye may rejoice, and lift up your heads forever, because of the blessings which the Lord God shall bestow upon your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.4'>For I know that ye have searched much, many of you, to know of things to come; wherefore I know that ye know that our flesh must waste away and die; nevertheless, in our bodies we shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.5'>Yea, I know that ye know that in the body he shall show himself unto those at Jerusalem, from whence we came; for it is expedient that it should be among them; for it behooveth the great Creator that he suffereth himself to become subject unto man in the flesh, and die for all men, that all men might become subject unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.6'>For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall; and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the presence of the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.13'>O how great the plan of our God! For on the other hand, the paradise of God must deliver up the spirits of the righteous, and the grave deliver up the body of the righteous; and the spirit and the body is restored to itself again, and all men become incorruptible, and immortal, and they are living souls, having a perfect knowledge like unto us in the flesh, save it be that our knowledge shall be perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.14'>Wherefore, we shall have a perfect knowledge of all our guilt, and our uncleanness, and our nakedness; and the righteous shall have a perfect knowledge of their enjoyment, and their righteousness, being clothed with purity, yea, even with the robe of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.15'>And it shall come to pass that when all men shall have passed from this first death unto life, insomuch as they have become immortal, they must appear before the judgment-seat of the Holy One of Israel; and then cometh the judgment, and then must they be judged according to the holy judgment of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.16'>And assuredly, as the Lord liveth, for the Lord God hath spoken it, and it is his eternal word, which cannot pass away, that they who are righteous shall be righteous still, and they who are filthy shall be filthy still; wherefore, they who are filthy are the devil and his angels; and they shall go away into everlasting fire, prepared for them; and their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever and has no end.</verse>

Behold, the way for man is narrow, but it lieth in a straight course before him, and the keeper of the gate is the Holy One of Israel; and he employeth no servant there; and there is none other way save it be by the gate; for he cannot be deceived, for the Lord God is his name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.45'>O, my beloved brethren, turn away from your sins; shake off the chains of him that would bind you fast; come unto that God who is the rock of your salvation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.52'>Behold, my beloved brethren, remember the words of your God; pray unto him continually by day, and give thanks unto his holy name by night. Let your hearts rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.53'>And behold how great the covenants of the Lord, and how great his condescensions unto the children of men; and because of his greatness, and his grace and mercy, he has promised unto us that our seed shall not utterly be destroyed, according to the flesh, but that he would preserve them; and in future generations they shall become a righteous branch unto the house of Israel.</verse>

For behold, Isaiah spake many things which were hard for many of my people to understand; for they know not concerning the manner of prophesying among the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.25.2'>For I, Nephi, have not taught them many things concerning the manner of the Jews; for their works were works of darkness, and their doings were doings of abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.25.3'>Wherefore, I write unto my people, unto all those that shall receive hereafter these things which I write, that they may know the judgments of God, that they come upon all nations, according to the word which he hath spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.25.4'>Wherefore, hearken, O my people, which are of the house of Israel, and give ear unto my words; for because the words of Isaiah are not plain unto you, nevertheless they are plain unto all those that are filled with the spirit of prophecy. But I give unto you a prophecy, according to the spirit which is in me; wherefore I shall prophesy according to the plainness which hath been with me from the time that I came out from Jerusalem with my father; for behold, my soul delighteth in plainness unto my people, that they may learn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.25.5'>Yea, and my soul delighteth in the words of Isaiah, for I came out from Jerusalem, and mine eyes hath beheld the things of the Jews, and I know that the Jews do understand the things of the prophets, and there is none other people that understand the things which were spoken unto the Jews like unto them, save it be that they are taught after the manner of the things of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.25.6'>But behold, I, Nephi, have not taught my children after the manner of the Jews; but behold, I, of myself, have dwelt at Jerusalem, wherefore I know concerning the regions round about; and I have made mention unto my children concerning the judgments of God, which hath come to pass among the Jews, unto my children, according to all that which Isaiah hath spoken, and I do not write them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.25.7'>But behold, I proceed with mine own prophecy, according to my plainness; in the which I know that no man can err; nevertheless, in the days that the prophecies of Isaiah shall be fulfilled men shall know of a surety, at the times when they shall come to pass.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.25.19'>For according to the words of the prophets, the Messiah cometh in six hundred years from the time that my father left Jerusalem; and according to the words of the prophets, and also the word of the angel of God, his name shall be Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.25.20'>And now, my brethren, I have spoken plainly that ye cannot err. And as the Lord God liveth that brought Israel up out of the land of Egypt, and gave unto Moses power that he should heal the nations after they had been bitten by the poisonous serpents, if they would cast their eyes unto the serpent which he did raise up before them, and also gave him power that he should smite the rock and the water should come forth; yea, behold I say unto you, that as these things are true, and as the Lord God liveth, there is none other name given under heaven save it be this Jesus Christ, of which I have spoken, whereby man can be saved.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.31.4'>Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.31.5'>And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water!</verse>

But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men that, according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.31.8'>Wherefore, after he was baptized with water the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.31.9'>And again, it showeth unto the children of men the straitness of the path, and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he having set the example before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.31.10'>And he said unto the children of men: Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.31.14'>But, behold, my beloved brethren, thus came the voice of the Son unto me, saying: After ye have repented of your sins, and witnessed unto the Father that ye are willing to keep my commandments, by the baptism of water, and have received the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost, and can speak with a new tongue, yea, even with the tongue of angels, and after this should deny me, it would have been better for you that ye had not known me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.31.15'>And I heard a voice from the Father, saying: Yea, the words of my Beloved are true and faithful. He that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved.</verse>

For the gate by which ye should enter is repentance and baptism by water; and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire and by the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.31.18'>And then are ye in this strait and narrow path which leads to eternal life; yea, ye have entered in by the gate; ye have done according to the commandments of the Father and the Son; and ye have received the Holy Ghost, which witnesses of the Father and the Son, unto the fulfilling of the promise which he hath made, that if ye entered in by the way ye should receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.31.19'>And now, my beloved brethren, after ye have gotten into this strait and narrow path, I would ask if all is done?

        <verse osisID='Exod.31.20'>Wherefore, ye must press forward with a steadfastness in Christ, having a perfect brightness of hope, and a love of God and of all men.

        <verse osisID='Exod.32.8'>And now, my beloved brethren, I perceive that ye ponder still in your hearts; and it grieveth me that I must speak concerning this thing. For if ye would hearken unto the Spirit which teacheth a man to pray ye would know that ye must pray; for the evil spirit teacheth not a man to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.1.1'>FOR behold, it came to pass that *fifty and five years had passed away from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; wherefore, Nephi gave me, Jacob, a commandment concerning the small plates, upon which these things are engraven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.2'>And he gave me, Jacob, a commandment that I should write upon these plates a few of the things which I considered to be most precious; that I should not touch, save it were lightly, concerning the history of this people which are called the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.3'>For he said that the history of his people should be engraven upon his other plates, and that I should preserve these plates and hand them down unto my seed, from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.4'>And if there were preaching which was sacred, or revelation which was great, or prophesying, that I should engraven the heads of them upon these plates, and touch upon them as much as it were possible, for Christ's sake, and for the sake of our people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.5'>For because of faith and great anxiety, it truly had been made manifest unto us concerning our people, what things should happen unto them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.1.7'>Wherefore we labored diligently among our people, that we might persuade them to come unto Christ, and partake of the goodness of God, that they might enter into his rest, lest by any means he should swear in his wrath they should not enter in, as in the provocation in the days of temptation while the children of Israel were in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.8'>Wherefore, we would to God that we could persuade all men not to rebel against God, to provoke him to anger, but that all men would believe in Christ, and view his death, and suffer his cross and bear the shame of the world; wherefore, I, Jacob, take it upon me to fulfil the commandment of my brother Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.9'>Now Nephi began to be old, and he saw that he must soon die; wherefore, he anointed a man to be a king and a ruler over his people now, according to the reigns of the kings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.2.10'>But, notwithstanding the greatness of the task, I must do according to the strict commands of God, and tell you concerning your wickedness and abominations, in the presence of the pure in heart, and the broken heart, and under the glance of the piercing eye of the Almighty God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.2.31'>For behold, I, the Lord, have seen the sorrow, and heard the mourning of the daughters of my people in the land of Jerusalem, yea, and in all the lands of my people, because of the wickedness and abominations of their husbands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.2.34'>And now behold, my brethren, ye know that these commandments were given to our father, Lehi; wherefore, ye have known them before; and ye have come unto great condemnation; for ye have done these things which ye ought not to have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.35'>Behold, ye have done greater iniquities than the Lamanites, our brethren. Ye have broken the hearts of your tender wives, and lost the confidence of your children, because of your bad examples before them; and the sobbings of their hearts ascend up to God against you. And because of the strictness of the word of God, which cometh down against you, many hearts died, pierced with deep wounds.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.3.1'>BUT behold, I, Jacob, would speak unto you that are pure in heart. Look unto God with firmness of mind, and pray unto him with exceeding faith, and he will console you in your afflictions, and he will plead your cause, and send down justice upon those who seek your destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.2'>O all ye that are pure in heart, lift up your heads and receive the pleasing word of God, and feast upon his love; for ye may, if your minds are firm, forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.3'>But, wo, wo, unto you that are not pure in heart, that are filthy this day before God; for except ye repent the land is cursed for your sakes; and the Lamanites, which are not filthy like unto you, nevertheless they are cursed with a sore cursing, shall scourge you even unto destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.4'>And the time speedily cometh, that except ye repent they shall possess the land of your inheritance, and the Lord God will lead away the righteous out from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.5'>Behold, the Lamanites your brethren, whom ye hate because of their filthiness and the cursing which hath come upon their skins, are more righteous than you; for they have not forgotten the commandment of the Lord, which was given unto our father-that they should have save it were one wife, and concubines they should have none, and there should not be whoredoms committed among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.6'>And now, this commandment they observe to keep; wherefore, because of this observance, in keeping this commandment, the Lord God will not destroy them, but will be merciful unto them; and one day they shall become a blessed people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.7'>Behold, their husbands love their wives, and their wives love their husbands; and their husbands and their wives love their children; and their unbelief and their hatred towards you is because of the iniquity of their fathers; wherefore, how much better are you than they, in the sight of your great Creator?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.8'>O my brethren, I fear that unless ye shall repent of your sins that their skins will be whiter than yours, when ye shall be brought with them before the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.9'>Wherefore, a commandment I give unto you, which is the word of God, that ye revile no more against them because of the darkness of their skins; neither shall ye revile against them because of their filthiness; but ye shall remember your own filthiness, and remember that their filthiness came because of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.10'>Wherefore, ye shall remember your children, how that ye have grieved their hearts because of the example that ye have set before them; and also, remember that ye may, because of your filthiness, bring your children unto destruction, and their sins be heaped upon your heads at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.11'>O my brethren, hearken unto my words; arouse the faculties of your souls; shake yourselves that ye may awake from the slumber of death; and loose yourselves from the pains of hell that ye may not become angels to the devil, to be cast into that lake of fire and brimstone which is the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.12'>And now I, Jacob, spake many more things unto the people of Nephi, warning them against fornication and lasciviousness, and every kind of sin, telling them the awful consequences of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.13'>And a hundredth part of the proceedings of this people, which now began to be numerous, cannot be written upon these plates; but many of their proceedings are written upon the larger plates, and their wars, and their contentions, and the reigns of their kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.14'>These plates are called the plates of Jacob, and they were made by the hand of Nephi. And I make an end of speaking these words.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.1'>NOW behold, it came to pass that I, Jacob, having ministered much unto my people in word, (and I cannot write but a little of my words, because of the difficulty of engraving our words upon plates) and we know that the things which we write upon plates must remain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.2'>But whatsoever things we write upon anything save it be upon plates must perish and vanish away; but we can write a few words upon plates, which will give our children, and also our beloved brethren, a small degree of knowledge concerning us, or concerning their fathers-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.3'>Now in this thing we do rejoice; and we labor diligently to engraven these words upon plates, hoping that our beloved brethren and our children will receive them with thankful hearts, and look upon them that they may learn with joy and not with sorrow, neither with contempt, concerning their first parents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.4'>For, for this intent have we written these things, that they may know that we knew of Christ, and we had a hope of his glory many hundred years before his coming; and not only we ourselves had a hope of his glory, but also all the holy prophets which were before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.5'>Behold, they believed in Christ and worshiped the Father in his name, and also we worship the Father in his name. And for this intent we keep the law of Moses, it pointing our souls to him; and for this cause it is sanctified unto us for righteousness, even as it was accounted unto Abraham in the wilderness to be obedient unto the commands of God in offering up his son Isaac, which is a similitude of God and his Only Begotten Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.6'>Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can command in the name of Jesus and the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.7'>Nevertheless, the Lord God showeth us our weakness that we may know that it is by his grace, and his great condescensions unto the children of men, that we have power to do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.8'>Behold, great and marvelous are the works of the Lord. How unsearchable are the depths of the mysteries of him; and it is impossible that man should find out all his ways. And no man knoweth of his ways save it be revealed unto him; wherefore, brethren, despise not the revelations of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.9'>For behold, by the power of his word man came upon the face of the earth, which earth was created by the power of his word. Wherefore, if God being able to speak and the world was, and to speak and man was created, O then, why not able to command the earth, or the workmanship of his hands upon the face of it, according to his will and pleasure?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.10'>Wherefore, brethren, seek not to counsel the Lord, but to take counsel from his hand. For behold, ye yourselves know that he counseleth in wisdom, and in justice, and in great mercy, over all his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.11'>Wherefore, beloved brethren, be reconciled unto him through the atonement of Christ, his Only Begotten Son, and ye may obtain a resurrection, according to the power of the resurrection which is in Christ, and be presented as the first-fruits of Christ unto God, having faith, and obtained a good hope of glory in him before he manifesteth himself in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.12'>And now, beloved, marvel not that I tell you these things; for why not speak of the atonement of Christ, and attain to a perfect knowledge of him, as to attain to the knowledge of a resurrection and the world to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.13'>Behold, my brethren, he that prophesieth, let him prophesy to the understanding of men; for the Spirit speaketh the truth and lieth not. Wherefore, it speaketh of things as they really are, and of things as they really will be; wherefore, these things are manifested unto us plainly, for the salvation of our souls. But behold, we are not witnesses alone in these things; for God also spake them unto prophets of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.14'>But behold, the Jews were a stiffnecked people; and they despised the words of plainness, and killed the prophets, and sought for things that they could not understand. Wherefore, because of their blindness, which blindness came by looking beyond the mark, they must needs fall; for God hath taken away his plainness from them, and delivered unto them many things which they cannot understand, because they desired it. And because they desired it God hath done it, that they may stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.15'>And now I, Jacob, am led on by the Spirit unto prophesying; for I perceive by the workings of the Spirit which is in me, that by the stumbling of the Jews they will reject the stone upon which they might build and have safe foundation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.16'>But behold, according to the scriptures, this stone shall become the great, and the last, and the only sure foundation, upon which the Jews can build.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.17'>And now, my beloved, how is it possible that these, after having rejected the sure foundation, can ever build upon it, that it may become the head of their corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.18'>Behold, my beloved brethren, I will unfold this mystery unto you; if I do not, by any means, get shaken from my firmness in the Spirit, and stumble because of my over anxiety for you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.1'>BEHOLD, my brethren, do ye not remember to have read the words of the prophet Zenos, which he spake unto the house of Israel, saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.3'>For behold, thus saith the Lord, I will liken thee, O house of Israel, like unto a tame olive-tree, which a man took and nourished in his vineyard; and it grew, and waxed old, and began to decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.4'>And it came to pass that the master of the vineyard went forth, and he saw that his olive-tree began to decay; and he said: I will prune it, and dig about it, and nourish it, that perhaps it may shoot forth young and tender branches, and it perish not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.8'>And behold, saith the Lord of the vineyard, I take away many of these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will; and it mattereth not that if it so be that the root of this tree will perish, I may preserve the fruit thereof unto myself; wherefore, I will take these young and tender branches, and I will graft them whithersoever I will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.9'>Take thou the branches of the wild olive-tree, and graft them in, in the stead thereof; and these which I have plucked off I will cast into the fire and burn them, that they may not cumber the ground of my vineyard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.11'>And the Lord of the vineyard caused that it should be digged about, and pruned, and nourished, saying unto his servant: It grieveth me that I should lose this tree; wherefore, that perhaps I might preserve the roots thereof that they perish not, that I might preserve them unto myself, I have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.12'>Wherefore, go thy way; watch the tree, and nourish it, according to my words.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.15'>And it came to pass that a long time passed away, and the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Come, let us go down into the vineyard, that we may labor in the vineyard.</verse>

Now, if we had not grafted in these branches, the tree thereof would have perished. And now, behold, I shall lay up much fruit, which the tree thereof hath brought forth; and the fruit thereof I shall lay up against the season, unto mine own self.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.20'>And it came to pass that they went forth whither the master had hid the natural branches of the tree, and he said unto the servant: Behold these; and he beheld the first that it had brought forth much fruit; and he beheld also that it was good. And he said unto the servant: Take of the fruit thereof, and lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self; for behold, said he, this long time have I nourished it, and it hath brought forth much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.21'>And it came to pass that the servant said unto his master: How comest thou hither to plant this tree, or this branch of the tree? For behold, it was the poorest spot in all the land of thy vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.22'>And the Lord of the vineyard said unto him: Counsel me not; I knew that it was a poor spot of ground; wherefore, I said unto thee, I have nourished it this long time, and thou beholdest that it hath brought forth much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.23'>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto his servant: Look hither; behold I have planted another branch of the tree also; and thou knowest that this spot of ground was poorer than the first. But, behold the tree. I have nourished it this long time, and it hath brought forth much fruit; therefore, gather it, and lay it up against the season, that I may preserve it unto mine own self.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.24'>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said again unto his servant: Look hither, and behold another branch also, which I have planted; behold that I have nourished it also, and it hath brought forth fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.25'>And he said unto the servant: Look hither and behold the last. Behold, this have I planted in a good spot of ground; and I have nourished it this long time, and only a part of the tree hath brought forth tame fruit, and the other part of the tree hath brought forth wild fruit; behold, I have nourished this tree like unto the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.26'>And it came to pass that the Lord of the vineyard said unto the servant: Pluck off the branches that have not brought forth good fruit, and cast them into the fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.65'>And as they begin to grow ye shall clear away the branches which bring forth bitter fruit, according to the strength of the good and the size thereof; and ye shall not clear away the bad thereof all at once, lest the roots thereof should be too strong for the graft, and the graft thereof shall perish, and I lose the trees of my vineyard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.5.71'>And the Lord of the vineyard said unto them: Go to, and labor in the vineyard, with your might. For behold, this is the last time that I shall nourish my vineyard; for the end is nigh at hand, and the season speedily cometh; and if ye labor with your might with me ye shall have joy in the fruit which I shall lay up unto myself against the time which will soon come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.72'>And it came to pass that the servants did go and labor with their mights; and the Lord of the vineyard labored also with them; and they did obey the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.73'>And there began to be the natural fruit again in the vineyard; and the natural branches began to grow and thrive exceedingly; and the wild branches began to be plucked off and to be cast away; and they did keep the root and the top thereof equal, according to the strength thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.74'>And thus they labored, with all diligence, according to the commandments of the Lord of the vineyard, even until the bad had been cast away out of the vineyard, and the Lord had preserved unto himself that the trees had become again the natural fruit; and they became like unto one body; and the fruits were equal; and the Lord of the vineyard had preserved unto himself the natural fruit, which was most precious unto him from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.75'>And it came to pass that when the Lord of the vineyard saw that his fruit was good, and that his vineyard was no more corrupt, he called up his servants, and said unto them: Behold, for this last time have we nourished my vineyard; and thou beholdest that I have done according to my will; and I have preserved the natural fruit, that it is good, even like as it was in the beginning. And blessed art thou; for because ye have been diligent in laboring with me in my vineyard, and have kept my commandments, and have brought unto me again the natural fruit, that my vineyard is no more corrupted, and the bad is cast away, behold ye shall have joy with me because of the fruit of my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.76'>For behold, for a long time will I lay up of the fruit of my vineyard unto mine own self against the season, which speedily cometh; and for the last time have I nourished my vineyard, and pruned it, and dug about it, and dunged it; wherefore I will lay up unto mine own self of the fruit, for a long time, according to that which I have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.77'>And when the time cometh that evil fruit shall again come into my vineyard, then will I cause the good and the bad to be gathered; and the good will I preserve unto myself, and the bad will I cast away into its own place.

        <verse osisID='Lev.6.2'>And the day that he shall set his hand again the second time to recover his people, is the day, yea, even the last time, that the servants of the Lord shall go forth in his power, to nourish and prune his vineyard; and after that the end soon cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.6.3'>And how blessed are they who have labored diligently in his vineyard; and how cursed are they who shall be cast out into their own place! And the world shall be burned with fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.6.5'>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I beseech of you in words of soberness that ye would repent, and come with full purpose of heart, and cleave unto God as he cleaveth unto you.

      <chapter osisID='Lev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.1'>AND now it came to pass after some years had passed away, there came a man among the people of Nephi, whose name was Sherem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.2'>And it came to pass that he began to preach among the people, and to declare unto them that there should be no Christ. And he preached many things which were flattering unto the people; and this he did that he might overthrow the doctrine of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.3'>And he labored diligently that he might lead away the hearts of the people, insomuch that he did lead away many hearts; and he knowing that I, Jacob, had faith in Christ who should come, he sought much opportunity that he might come unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.4'>And he was learned, that he had a perfect knowledge of the language of the people; wherefore, he could use much flattery, and much power of speech, according to the power of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.5'>And he had hope to shake me from the faith, notwithstanding the many revelations and the many things which I had seen concerning these things; for I truly had seen angels, and they had ministered unto me. And also, I had heard the voice of the Lord speaking unto me in very word, from time to time; wherefore, I could not be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.6'>And it came to pass that he came unto me, and on this wise did he speak unto me, saying: Brother Jacob, I have sought much opportunity that I might speak unto you; for I have heard and also know that thou goest about much, preaching that which ye call the gospel, or the doctrine of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.7'>And ye have led away much of this people that they pervert the right way of God, and keep not the law of Moses which is the right way; and convert the law of Moses into the worship of a being which ye say shall come many hundred years hence. And now behold, I, Sherem, declare unto you that this is blasphemy; for no man knoweth of such things; for he cannot tell of things to come. And after this manner did Sherem contend against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.8'>But behold, the Lord God poured in his Spirit into my soul, insomuch that I did confound him in all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.9'>And I said unto him: Deniest thou the Christ who shall come? And he said: If there should be a Christ, I would not deny him; but I know that there is no Christ, neither has been, nor ever will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.10'>And I said unto him: Believest thou the scriptures? And he said, Yea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.11'>And I said unto him: Then ye do not understand them; for they truly testify of Christ. Behold, I say unto you that none of the prophets have written, nor prophesied, save they have spoken concerning this Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.12'>And this is not all-it has been made manifest unto me, for I have heard and seen; and it also has been made manifest unto me by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore, I know if there should be no atonement made all mankind must be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.13'>And it came to pass that he said unto me: Show me a sign by this power of the Holy Ghost, in the which ye know so much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.14'>And I said unto him: What am I that I should tempt God to show unto thee a sign in the thing which thou knowest to be true? Yet thou wilt deny it, because thou art of the devil. Nevertheless, not my will be done; but if God shall smite thee, let that be a sign unto thee that he has power, both in heaven and in earth; and also, that Christ shall come. And thy will, O Lord, be done, and not mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.15'>And it came to pass that when I, Jacob, had spoken these words, the power of the Lord came upon him, insomuch that he fell to the earth. And it came to pass that he was nourished for the space of many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.16'>And it came to pass that he said unto the people: Gather together on the morrow, for I shall die; wherefore, I desire to speak unto the people before I shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.17'>And it came to pass that on the morrow the multitude were gathered together; and he spake plainly unto them and denied the things which he had taught them, and confessed the Christ, and the power of the Holy Ghost, and the ministering of angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.18'>And he spake plainly unto them, that he had been deceived by the power of the devil. And he spake of hell, and of eternity, and of eternal punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.19'>And he said: I fear lest I have committed the unpardonable sin, for I have lied unto God; for I denied the Christ, and said that I believed the scriptures; and they truly testify of him. And because I have thus lied unto God I greatly fear lest my case shall be awful; but I confess unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.20'>And it came to pass that when he had said these words he could say no more, and he gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.21'>And when the multitude had witnessed that he spake these things as he was about to give up the ghost, they were astonished exceedingly; insomuch that the power of God came down upon them, and they were overcome that they fell to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.22'>Now, this thing was pleasing unto me, Jacob, for I had requested it of my Father who was in heaven; for he had heard my cry and answered my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.23'>And it came to pass that peace and the love of God was restored again among the people; and they searched the scriptures, and hearkened no more to the words of this wicked man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.24'>And it came to pass that many means were devised to reclaim and restore the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth; but it all was vain, for they delighted in wars and bloodshed, and they had an eternal hatred against us, their brethren. And they sought by the power of their arms to destroy us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.25'>Wherefore, the people of Nephi did fortify against them with their arms, and with all their might, trusting in the God and rock of their salvation; wherefore, they became as yet, conquerors of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.26'>And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the other plates of Nephi, wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.7.27'>And I, Jacob, saw that I must soon go down to my grave; wherefore, I said unto my son Enos: Take these plates. And I told him the things which my brother Nephi had commanded me, and he promised obedience unto the commands. And I make an end of my writing upon these plates, which writing has been small; and to the reader I bid farewell, hoping that many of my brethren may read my words. Brethren, adieu.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Num.1.1'>BEHOLD, it came to pass that I, Enos, knowing my father that he was a just man-for he taught me in his language, and also in the nurture and admonition of the Lord-and blessed be the name of my God for it-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.2'>And I will tell you of the wrestle which I had before God, before I received a remission of my sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.3'>Behold, I went to hunt beasts in the forests; and the words which I had often heard my father speak concerning eternal life, and the joy of the saints, sunk deep into my heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.4'>And my soul hungered; and I kneeled down before my Maker, and I cried unto him in mighty prayer and supplication for mine own soul; and all the day long did I cry unto him; yea, and when the night came I did still raise my voice high that it reached the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.5'>And there came a voice unto me, saying: Enos, thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.6'>And I, Enos, knew that God could not lie; wherefore, my guilt was swept away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.7'>And I said: Lord, how is it done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.8'>And he said unto me: Because of thy faith in Christ, whom thou hast never before heard nor seen. And many years pass away before he shall manifest himself in the flesh; wherefore, go to, thy faith hath made thee whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.9'>Now, it came to pass that when I had heard these words I began to feel a desire for the welfare of my brethren, the Nephites; wherefore, I did pour out my whole soul unto God for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.10'>And while I was thus struggling in the spirit, behold, the voice of the Lord came into my mind again, saying: I will visit thy brethren according to their diligence in keeping my commandments. I have given unto them this land, and it is a holy land; and I curse it not save it be for the cause of iniquity; wherefore, I will visit thy brethren according as I have said; and their transgressions will I bring down with sorrow upon their own heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.11'>And after I, Enos, had heard these words, my faith began to be unshaken in the Lord; and I prayed unto him with many long strugglings for my brethren, the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.12'>And it came to pass that after I had prayed and labored with all diligence, the Lord said unto me: I will grant unto thee according to thy desires, because of thy faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.13'>And now behold, this was the desire which I desired of him-that if it should so be, that my people, the Nephites, should fall into transgression, and by any means be destroyed, and the Lamanites should not be destroyed, that the Lord God would preserve a record of my people, the Nephites; even if it so be by the power of his holy arm, that it might be brought forth at some future day unto the Lamanites, that, perhaps, they might be brought unto salvation-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.14'>For at the present our strugglings were vain in restoring them to the true faith. And they swore in their wrath that, if it were possible, they would destroy our records and us, and also all the traditions of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.15'>Wherefore, I knowing that the Lord God was able to preserve our records, I cried unto him continually, for he had said unto me: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask in faith, believing that ye shall receive in the name of Christ, ye shall receive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.16'>And I had faith, and I did cry unto God that he would preserve the records; and he covenanted with me that he would bring them forth unto the Lamanites in his own due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.17'>And I, Enos, knew it would be according to the covenant which he had made; wherefore my soul did rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.18'>And the Lord said unto me: Thy fathers have also required of me this thing; and it shall be done unto them according to their faith; for their faith was like unto thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.19'>And now it came to pass that I, Enos, went about among the people of Nephi, prophesying of things to come, and testifying of the things which I had heard and seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.20'>And I bear record that the people of Nephi did seek diligently to restore the Lamanites unto the true faith in God. But our labors were vain; their hatred was fixed, and they were led by their evil nature that they became wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, full of idolatry and filthiness; feeding upon beasts of prey; dwelling in tents, and wandering about in the wilderness with a short skin girdle about their loins and their heads shaven; and their skill was in the bow, and in the cimeter, and the ax. And many of them did eat nothing save it was raw meat; and they were continually seeking to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.21'>And it came to pass that the people of Nephi did till the land, and raise all manner of grain, and of fruit, and flocks of herds, and flocks of all manner of cattle of every kind, and goats, and wild goats, and also many horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.22'>And there were exceedingly many prophets among us. And the people were a stiffnecked people, hard to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.23'>And there was nothing save it was exceeding harshness, preaching and prophesying of wars, and contentions, and destructions, and continually reminding them of death, and the duration of eternity, and the judgments and the power of God, and all these things-stirring them up continually to keep them in the fear of the Lord. I say there was nothing short of these things, and exceedingly great plainness of speech, would keep them from going down speedily to destruction. And after this manner do I write concerning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.24'>And I saw wars between the Nephites and Lamanites in the course of my days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.25'>And it came to pass that I began to be old, *and an hundred and seventy and nine years had passed away from the time that our father Lehi left Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.26'>And I saw that I must soon go down to my grave, having been wrought upon by the power of God that I must preach and prophesy unto this people, and declare the word according to the truth which is in Christ. And I have declared it in all my days, and have rejoiced in it above that of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Num.1.27'>And I soon go to the place of my rest, which is with my Redeemer; for I know that in him I shall rest. And I rejoice in the day when my mortal shall put on immortality, and shall stand before him; then shall I see his face with pleasure, and he will say unto me: Come unto me, ye blessed, there is a place prepared for you in the mansions of my Father.

        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>And as these plates are small, and as these things are written for the intent of the benefit of our brethren the Lamanites, wherefore, it must needs be that I write a little; but I shall not write the things of my prophesying, nor of my revelations. For what could I write more than my fathers have written? For have not they revealed the plan of salvation? I say unto you, Yea; and this sufficeth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>Behold, it is expedient that much should be done among this people, because of the hardness of their hearts, and the deafness of their ears, and the blindness of their minds, and the stiffness of their necks; nevertheless, God is exceedingly merciful unto them, and has not as yet swept them off from the face of the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>And they were scattered upon much of the face of the land, and the Lamanites also. And they were exceedingly more numerous than were they of the Nephites; and they loved murder and would drink the blood of beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>And it came to pass that they came many times against us, the Nephites, to battle. But our kings and our leaders were mighty men in the faith of the Lord; and they taught the people the ways of the Lord; wherefore, we withstood the Lamanites and swept them away out of our lands, and began to fortify our cities, or whatsoever place of our inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>And we multiplied exceedingly, and spread upon the face of the land, and became exceedingly rich in gold, and in silver, and in precious things, and in fine workmanship of wood, in buildings, and in machinery, and also in iron and copper, and brass and steel, making all manner of tools of every kind to till the ground, and weapons of war-yea, the sharp pointed arrow, and the quiver, and the dart, and the javelin, and all preparations for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>And thus being prepared to meet the Lamanites, they did not prosper against us. But the word of the Lord was verified, which he spake unto our fathers, saying that: Inasmuch as ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>And it came to pass that the prophets of the Lord did threaten the people of Nephi, according to the word of God, that if they did not keep the commandments, but should fall into transgression, they should be destroyed from off the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>Wherefore, the prophets, and the priests, and the teachers, did labor diligently, exhorting with all long-suffering the people to diligence; teaching the law of Moses, and the intent for which it was given; persuading them to look forward unto the Messiah, and believe in him to come as though he already was. And after this manner did they teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>And it came to pass that by so doing they kept them from being destroyed upon the face of the land; for they did prick their hearts with the word, continually stirring them up unto repentance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And now, I speak somewhat concerning that which I have written; for after I had made an abridgment from the plates of Nephi, down to the reign of this king Benjamin, of whom Amaleki spake, I searched among the records which had been delivered into my hands, and I found these plates, which contained this small account of the prophets, from Jacob down to the reign of this king Benjamin, and also many of the words of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And the things which are upon these plates pleasing me, because of the prophecies of the coming of Christ; and my fathers knowing that many of them have been fulfilled; yea, and I also know that as many things as have been prophesied concerning us down to this day have been fulfilled, and as many as go beyond this day must surely come to pass-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>Wherefore, I chose these things, to finish my record upon them, which remainder of my record I shall take from the plates of Nephi; and I cannot write the hundredth part of the things of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But behold, I shall take these plates, which contain these prophesyings and revelations, and put them with the remainder of my record, for they are choice unto me; and I know they will be choice unto my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And I do this for a wise purpose; for thus it whispereth me, according to the workings of the Spirit of the Lord which is in me. And now, I do not know all things; but the Lord knoweth all things which are to come; wherefore, he worketh in me to do according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>And my prayer to God is concerning my brethren, that they may once again come to the knowledge of God, yea, the redemption of Christ; that they may once again be a delightsome people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And now I, Mormon, *proceed to finish out my record, which I take from the plates of Nephi; and I make it according to the knowledge and the understanding which God has given me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>Wherefore, it came to pass that after Amaleki had delivered up these plates into the hands of king Benjamin, he took them and put them with the other plates, which contained records which had been handed down by the kings, from generation to generation until the days of king Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And they were handed down from king Benjamin, from generation to generation until they have fallen into my hands. And I, Mormon, pray to God that they may be preserved from this time henceforth. And I know that they will be preserved; for there are great things written upon them, out of which my people and their brethren shall be judged at the great and last day, according to the word of God which is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And now, concerning this king Benjamin-he had somewhat of contentions among his own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And it came to pass also that the armies of the Lamanites came down out of the land of Nephi, to battle against his people. But behold, king Benjamin gathered together his armies, and he did stand against them; and he did fight with the strength of his own arm, with the sword of Laban.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And in the strength of the Lord they did contend against their enemies, until they had slain many thousands of the Lamanites. And it came to pass that they did contend against the Lamanites until they had driven them out of all the lands of their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And it came to pass that after there had been false Christs, and their mouths had been shut, and they punished according to their crimes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And after there had been false prophets, and false preachers and teachers among the people, and all these having been punished according to their crimes; and after there having been much contention and many dissensions away unto the Lamanites, behold, it came to pass that king Benjamin, with the assistance of the holy prophets who were among his people-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>For behold, king Benjamin was a holy man, and he did reign over his people in righteousness; and there were many holy men in the land, and they did speak the word of God with power and with authority; and they did use much sharpness because of the stiffneckedness of the people-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Wherefore, with the help of these, king Benjamin, by laboring with all the might of his body and the faculty of his whole soul, and also the prophets, did once more establish peace in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And it came to pass that the people of Zarahemla, and of Mosiah, did unite together; and Mosiah was appointed to be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And it came to pass in the days of Mosiah, there was a large stone brought unto him with engravings on it; and he did interpret the engravings by the gift and power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And they gave an account of one Coriantumr, and the slain of his people. And Coriantumr was discovered by the people of Zarahemla; and he dwelt with them for the space of nine moons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>It also spake a few words concerning his fathers. And his first parents came out from the tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people; and the severity of the Lord fell upon them according to his judgments, which are just; and their bones lay scattered in the land northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>Behold, I, Amaleki, was born in the days of Mosiah; and I have lived to see his death; and Benjamin, his son, reigneth in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And behold, I have seen, in the days of king Benjamin, a serious war and much bloodshed between the Nephites and the Lamanites. But behold, the Nephites did obtain much advantage over them; yea, insomuch that king Benjamin did drive them out of the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And it came to pass that I began to be old; and, having no seed, and knowing king Benjamin to be a just man before the Lord, wherefore, I shall deliver up these plates unto him, exhorting all men to come unto God, the Holy One of Israel, and believe in prophesying, and in revelations, and in the ministering of angels, and in the gift of speaking with tongues, and in the gift of interpreting languages, and in all things which are good; for there is nothing which is good save it comes from the Lord; and that which is evil cometh from the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And now, my beloved brethren, I would that ye should come unto Christ, who is the Holy One of Israel, and partake of his salvation, and the power of his redemption. Yea, come unto him, and offer your whole souls as an offering unto him, and continue in fasting and praying, and endure to the end; and as the Lord liveth ye will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>And now I would speak somewhat concerning a certain number who went up into the wilderness to return to the land of Nephi; for there was a large number who were desirous to possess the land of their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>Wherefore, they went up into the wilderness. And their leader being a strong and mighty man, and a stiffnecked man, wherefore he caused a contention among them; and they were all slain, save fifty, in the wilderness, and they returned again to the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>And it came to pass that they also took others to a considerable number, and took their journey again into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>And I, Amaleki, had a brother, who also went with them; and I have not since known concerning them. And I am about to lie down in my grave; and these plates are full. And I make an end of my speaking.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.1'>AND now there was no more contention in all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who belonged to king Benjamin, so that king Benjamin had continual peace all the remainder of his days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.2'>And it came to pass that he had three sons; and he called their names Mosiah, and Helorum, and Helaman. And he caused that they should be taught in all the language of his fathers, that thereby they might become men of understanding; and that they might know concerning the prophecies which had been spoken by the mouths of their fathers, which were delivered them by the hand of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.3'>And he also taught them concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, saying: My sons, I would that ye should remember that were it not for these plates, which contain these records and these commandments, we must have suffered in ignorance, even at this present time, not knowing the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.4'>For it were not possible that our father, Lehi, could have remembered all these things, to have taught them to his children, except it were for the help of these plates; for he having been taught in the language of the Egyptians therefore he could read these engravings, and teach them to his children, that thereby they could teach them to their children, and so fulfilling the commandments of God, even down to this present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.5'>I say unto you, my sons, were it not for these things, which have been kept and preserved by the hand of God, that we might read and understand of his mysteries, and have his commandments always before our eyes, that even our fathers would have dwindled in unbelief, and we should have been like unto our brethren, the Lamanites, who know nothing concerning these things, or even do not believe them when they are taught them, because of the traditions of their fathers, which are not correct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.6'>O my sons, I would that ye should remember that these sayings are true, and also that these records are true. And behold, also the plates of Nephi, which contain the records and the sayings of our fathers from the time they left Jerusalem until now, and they are true; and we can know of their surety because we have them before our eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.7'>And now, my sons, I would that ye should remember to search them diligently, that ye may profit thereby; and I would that ye should keep the commandments of God, that ye may prosper in the land according to the promises which the Lord made unto our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.8'>And many more things did king Benjamin teach his sons, which are not written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.9'>And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of teaching his sons, that he waxed old, and he saw that he must very soon go the way of all the earth; therefore, he thought it expedient that he should confer the kingdom upon one of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.10'>Therefore, *he had Mosiah brought before him; and these are the words which he spake unto him, saying: My son, I would that ye should make a proclamation throughout all this land among all this people, or the people of Zarahemla, and the people of Mosiah who dwell in the land, that thereby they may be gathered together; for on the morrow I shall proclaim unto this my people out of mine own mouth that thou art a king and a ruler over this people, whom the Lord our God hath given us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.11'>And moreover, I shall give this people a name, that thereby they may be distinguished above all the people which the Lord God hath brought out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I do because they have been a diligent people in keeping the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.12'>And I give unto them a name that never shall be blotted out, except it be through transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.13'>Yea, and moreover I say unto you, that if this highly favored people of the Lord should fall into transgression, and become a wicked and an adulterous people, that the Lord will deliver them up, that thereby they become weak like unto their brethren; and he will no more preserve them by his matchless and marvelous power, as he has hitherto preserved our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.14'>For I say unto you, that if he had not extended his arm in the preservation of our fathers they must have fallen into the hands of the Lamanites, and become victims to their hatred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.15'>And it came to pass that after king Benjamin had made an end of these sayings to his son, that he gave him charge concerning all the affairs of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.16'>And moreover, he also gave him charge concerning the records which were engraven on the plates of brass; and also the plates of Nephi; and also, the sword of Laban, and the ball or director, which led our fathers through the wilderness, which was prepared by the hand of the Lord that thereby they might be led, every one according to the heed and diligence which they gave unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.17'>Therefore, as they were unfaithful they did not prosper nor progress in their journey, but were driven back, and incurred the displeasure of God upon them; and therefore they were smitten with famine and sore afflictions, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.18'>And now, it came to pass that Mosiah went and did as his father had commanded him, and proclaimed unto all the people who were in the land of Zarahemla that thereby they might gather themselves together, to go up to the temple to hear the words which his father should speak unto them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.1'>AND it came to pass that after Mosiah had done as his father had commanded him, and had made a proclamation throughout all the land, that the people gathered themselves together throughout all the land, that they might go up to the temple to hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.2'>And there were a great number, even so many that they did not number them; for they had multiplied exceedingly and waxed great in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.3'>And they also took of the firstlings of their flocks, that they might offer sacrifice and burnt offerings according to the law of Moses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.4'>And also that they might give thanks to the Lord their God, who had brought them out of the land of Jerusalem, and who had delivered them out of the hands of their enemies, and had appointed just men to be their teachers, and also a just man to be their king, who had established peace in the land of Zarahemla, and who had taught them to keep the commandments of God, that they might rejoice and be filled with love towards God and all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.5'>And it came to pass that when they came up to the temple, they pitched their tents round about, every man according to his family, consisting of his wife, and his sons, and his daughters, and their sons, and their daughters, from the eldest down to the youngest, every family being separate one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.6'>And they pitched their tents round about the temple, every man having his tent with the door thereof towards the temple, that thereby they might remain in their tents and hear the words which king Benjamin should speak unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.7'>For the multitude being so great that king Benjamin could not teach them all within the walls of the temple, therefore he caused a tower to be erected, that thereby his people might hear the words which he should speak unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.8'>And it came to pass that he began to speak to his people from the tower; and they could not all hear his words because of the greatness of the multitude; therefore he caused that the words which he spake should be written and sent forth among those that were not under the sound of his voice, that they might also receive his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.9'>And these are the words which he spake and caused to be written, saying: My brethren, all ye that have assembled yourselves together, you that can hear my words which I shall speak unto you this day; for I have not commanded you to come up hither to trifle with the words which I shall speak, but that you should hearken unto me, and open your ears that ye may hear, and your hearts that ye may understand, and your minds that the mysteries of God may be unfolded to your view.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.10'>I have not commanded you to come up hither that ye should fear me, or that ye should think that I of myself am more than a mortal man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.11'>But I am like as yourselves, subject to all manner of infirmities in body and mind; yet I have been chosen by this people, and consecrated by my father, and was suffered by the hand of the Lord that I should be a ruler and a king over this people; and have been kept and preserved by his matchless power, to serve you with all the might, mind and strength which the Lord hath granted unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.12'>I say unto you that as I have been suffered to spend my days in your service, even up to this time, and have not sought gold nor silver nor any manner of riches of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.13'>Neither have I suffered that ye should be confined in dungeons, nor that ye should make slaves one of another, nor that ye should murder, or plunder, or steal, or commit adultery; nor even have I suffered that ye should commit any manner of wickedness, and have taught you that ye should keep the commandments of the Lord, in all things which he hath commanded you-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.14'>And even I, myself, have labored with mine own hands that I might serve you, and that ye should not be laden with taxes, and that there should nothing come upon you which was grievous to be borne-and of all these things which I have spoken, ye yourselves are witnesses this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.15'>Yet, my brethren, I have not done these things that I might boast, neither do I tell these things that thereby I might accuse you; but I tell you these things that ye may know that I can answer a clear conscience before God this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.16'>Behold, I say unto you that because I said unto you that I had spent my days in your service, I do not desire to boast, for I have only been in the service of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.17'>And behold, I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.18'>Behold, ye have called me your king; and if I, whom ye call your king, do labor to serve you, then ought not ye to labor to serve one another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.19'>And behold also, if I, whom ye call your king, who has spent his days in your service, and yet has been in the service of God, do merit any thanks from you, O how you ought to thank your heavenly King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.20'>I say unto you, my brethren, that if you should render all the thanks and praise which your whole soul has power to possess, to that God who has created you, and has kept and preserved you, and has caused that ye should rejoice, and has granted that ye should live in peace one with another-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.21'>I say unto you that if ye should serve him who has created you from the beginning, and is preserving you from day to day, by lending you breath, that ye may live and move and do according to your own will, and even supporting you from one moment to another-I say, if ye should serve him with all your whole souls yet ye would be unprofitable servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.22'>And behold, all that he requires of you is to keep his commandments; and he has promised you that if ye would keep his commandments ye should prosper in the land; and he never doth vary from that which he hath said; therefore, if ye do keep his commandments he doth bless you and prosper you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.23'>And now, in the first place, he hath created you, and granted unto you your lives, for which ye are indebted unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.24'>And secondly, he doth require that ye should do as he hath commanded you; for which if ye do, he doth immediately bless you; and therefore he hath paid you. And ye are still indebted unto him, and are, and will be, forever and ever; therefore, of what have ye to boast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.25'>And now I ask, can ye say aught of yourselves? I answer you, Nay. Ye cannot say that ye are even as much as the dust of the earth; yet ye were created of the dust of the earth; but behold, it belongeth to him who created you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.26'>And I, even I, whom ye call your king, am no better than ye yourselves are; for I am also of the dust. And ye behold that I am old, and am about to yield up this mortal frame to its mother earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.27'>Therefore, as I said unto you that I had served you, walking with a clear conscience before God, even so I at this time have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might be found blameless, and that your blood should not come upon me, when I shall stand to be judged of God of the things whereof he hath commanded me concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.28'>I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together that I might rid my garments of your blood, at this period of time when I am about to go down to my grave, that I might go down in peace, and my immortal spirit may join the choirs above in singing the praises of a just God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.29'>And moreover, I say unto you that I have caused that ye should assemble yourselves together, that I might declare unto you that I can no longer be your teacher, nor your king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.30'>For even at this time, my whole frame doth tremble exceedingly while attempting to speak unto you; but the Lord God doth support me, and hath suffered me that I should speak unto you, and hath commanded me that I should declare unto you this day, that my son Mosiah is a king and a ruler over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.31'>And now, my brethren, I would that ye should do as ye have hitherto done. As ye have kept my commandments, and also the commandments of my father, and have prospered, and have been kept from falling into the hands of your enemies, even so if ye shall keep the commandments of my son, or the commandments of God which shall be delivered unto you by him, ye shall prosper in the land, and your enemies shall have no power over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.32'>But, O my people, beware lest there shall arise contentions among you, and ye list to obey the evil spirit, which was spoken of by my father Mosiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.33'>For behold, there is a wo pronounced upon him who listeth to obey that spirit; for if he listeth to obey him, and remaineth and dieth in his sins, the same drinketh damnation to his own soul; for he receiveth for his wages an everlasting punishment, having transgressed the law of God contrary to his own knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.34'>I say unto you, that there are not any among you, except it be your little children that have not been taught concerning these things, but what knoweth that ye are eternally indebted to your heavenly Father, to render to him all that you have and are; and also have been taught concerning the records which contain the prophecies which have been spoken by the holy prophets, even down to the time our father, Lehi, left Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.35'>And also, all that has been spoken by our fathers until now. And behold, also, they spake that which was commanded them of the Lord; therefore, they are just and true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.36'>And now, I say unto you, my brethren, that after ye have known and have been taught all these things, if ye should transgress and go contrary to that which has been spoken, that ye do withdraw yourselves from the Spirit of the Lord, that it may have no place in you to guide you in wisdom's paths that ye may be blessed, prospered, and preserved-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.37'>I say unto you, that the man that doeth this, the same cometh out in open rebellion against God; therefore he listeth to obey the evil spirit, and becometh an enemy to all righteousness; therefore, the Lord has no place in him, for he dwelleth not in unholy temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.38'>Therefore if that man repenteth not, and remaineth and dieth an enemy to God, the demands of divine justice do awaken his immortal soul to a lively sense of his own guilt, which doth cause him to shrink from the presence of the Lord, and doth fill his breast with guilt, and pain, and anguish, which is like an unquenchable fire, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.39'>And now I say unto you, that mercy hath no claim on that man; therefore his final doom is to endure a never-ending torment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.40'>O, all ye old men, and also ye young men, and you little children who can understand my words, for I have spoken plainly unto you that ye might understand, I pray that ye should awake to a remembrance of the awful situation of those that have fallen into transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.41'>And moreover, I would desire that ye should consider on the blessed and happy state of those that keep the commandments of God. For behold, they are blessed in all things, both temporal and spiritual; and if they hold out faithful to the end they are received into heaven, that thereby they may dwell with God in a state of never-ending happiness. O remember, remember that these things are true; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.1'>AND again my brethren, I would call your attention, for I have somewhat more to speak unto you; for behold, I have things to tell you concerning that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.2'>And the things which I shall tell you are made known unto me by an angel from God. And he said unto me: Awake; and I awoke, and behold he stood before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.3'>And he said unto me: Awake, and hear the words which I shall tell thee; for behold, I am come to declare unto you the glad tidings of great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.4'>For the Lord hath heard thy prayers, and hath judged of thy righteousness, and hath sent me to declare unto thee that thou mayest rejoice; and that thou mayest declare unto thy people, that they may also be filled with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.5'>For behold, the time cometh, and is not far distant, that with power, the Lord Omnipotent who reigneth, who was, and is from all eternity to all eternity, shall come down from heaven among the children of men, and shall dwell in a tabernacle of clay, and shall go forth amongst men, working mighty miracles, such as healing the sick, raising the dead, causing the lame to walk, the blind to receive their sight, and the deaf to hear, and curing all manner of diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.6'>And he shall cast out devils, or the evil spirits which dwell in the hearts of the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.7'>And lo, he shall suffer temptations, and pain of body, hunger, thirst, and fatigue, even more than man can suffer, except it be unto death; for behold, blood cometh from every pore, so great shall be his anguish for the wickedness and the abominations of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.8'>And he shall be called Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things from the beginning; and his mother shall be called Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.9'>And lo, he cometh unto his own, that salvation might come unto the children of men even through faith on his name; and even after all this they shall consider him a man, and say that he hath a devil, and shall scourge him, and shall crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.10'>And he shall rise the third day from the dead; and behold, he standeth to judge the world; and behold, all these things are done that a righteous judgment might come upon the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.11'>For behold, and also his blood atoneth for the sins of those who have fallen by the transgression of Adam, who have died not knowing the will of God concerning them, or who have ignorantly sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.12'>But wo, wo unto him who knoweth that he rebelleth against God! For salvation cometh to none such except it be through repentance and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.13'>And the Lord God hath sent his holy prophets among all the children of men, to declare these things to every kindred, nation, and tongue, that thereby whosoever should believe that Christ should come, the same might receive remission of their sins, and rejoice with exceedingly great joy, even as though he had already come among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.14'>Yet the Lord God saw that his people were a stiffnecked people, and he appointed unto them a law, even the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.15'>And many signs, and wonders, and types, and shadows showed he unto them, concerning his coming; and also holy prophets spake unto them concerning his coming; and yet they hardened their hearts, and understood not that the law of Moses availeth nothing except it were through the atonement of his blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.16'>And even if it were possible that little children could sin they could not be saved; but I say unto you they are blessed; for behold, as in Adam, or by nature, they fall, even so the blood of Christ atoneth for their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.17'>And moreover, I say unto you, that there shall be no other name given nor any other way nor means whereby salvation can come unto the children of men, only in and through the name of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.18'>For behold he judgeth, and his judgment is just; and the infant perisheth not that dieth in his infancy; but men drink damnation to their own souls except they humble themselves and become as little children, and believe that salvation was, and is, and is to come, in and through the atoning blood of Christ, the Lord Omnipotent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.19'>For the natural man is an enemy to God, and has been from the fall of Adam, and will be, forever and ever, unless he yields to the enticings of the Holy Spirit, and putteth off the natural man and becometh a saint through the atonement of Christ the Lord, and becometh as a child, submissive, meek, humble, patient, full of love, willing to submit to all things which the Lord seeth fit to inflict upon him, even as a child doth submit to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.20'>And moreover, I say unto you, that the time shall come when the knowledge of a Savior shall spread throughout every nation, kindred, tongue, and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.21'>And behold, when that time cometh, none shall be found blameless before God, except it be little children, only through repentance and faith on the name of the Lord God Omnipotent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.22'>And even at this time, when thou shalt have taught thy people the things which the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, even then are they found no more blameless in the sight of God, only according to the words which I have spoken unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.23'>And now I have spoken the words which the Lord God hath commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.24'>And thus saith the Lord: They shall stand as a bright testimony against this people, at the judgment day; whereof they shall be judged, every man according to his works, whether they be good, or whether they be evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.25'>And if they be evil they are consigned to an awful view of their own guilt and abominations, which doth cause them to shrink from the presence of the Lord into a state of misery and endless torment, from whence they can no more return; therefore they have drunk damnation to their own souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.26'>Therefore, they have drunk out of the cup of the wrath of God, which justice could no more deny unto them than it could deny that Adam should fall because of his partaking of the forbidden fruit; therefore, mercy could have claim on them no more forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.27'>And their torment is as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flames are unquenchable, and whose smoke ascendeth up forever and ever. Thus hath the Lord commanded me. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.1'>AND now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had made an end of speaking the words which had been delivered unto him by the angel of the Lord, that he cast his eyes round about on the multitude, and behold they had fallen to the earth, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.2'>And they had viewed themselves in their own carnal state, even less than the dust of the earth. And they all cried aloud with one voice, saying: O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood of Christ that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified; for we believe in Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who created heaven and earth, and all things; who shall come down among the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.3'>And it came to pass that after they had spoken these words the Spirit of the Lord came upon them, and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins, and having peace of conscience, because of the exceeding faith which they had in Jesus Christ who should come, according to the words which king Benjamin had spoken unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.4'>And king Benjamin again opened his mouth and began to speak unto them, saying: My friends and my brethren, my kindred and my people, I would again call your attention, that ye may hear and understand the remainder of my words which I shall speak unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.5'>For behold, if the knowledge of the goodness of God at this time has awakened you to a sense of your nothingness, and your worthless and fallen state-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.6'>I say unto you, if ye have come to a knowledge of the goodness of God, and his matchless power, and his wisdom, and his patience, and his long-suffering towards the children of men; and also, the atonement which has been prepared from the foundation of the world, that thereby salvation might come to him that should put his trust in the Lord, and should be diligent in keeping his commandments, and continue in the faith even unto the end of his life, I mean the life of the mortal body-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.7'>I say, that this is the man who receiveth salvation, through the atonement which was prepared from the foundation of the world for all mankind, which ever were since the fall of Adam, or who are, or who ever shall be, even unto the end of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.8'>And this is the means whereby salvation cometh. And there is none other salvation save this which hath been spoken of; neither are there any conditions whereby man can be saved except the conditions which I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.9'>Believe in God; believe that he is, and that he created all things, both in heaven and in earth; believe that he has all wisdom, and all power, both in heaven and in earth; believe that man doth not comprehend all the things which the Lord can comprehend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.10'>And again, believe that ye must repent of your sins and forsake them, and humble yourselves before God; and ask in sincerity of heart that he would forgive you; and now, if you believe all these things see that ye do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.11'>And again I say unto you as I have said before, that as ye have come to the knowledge of the glory of God, or if ye have known of his goodness and have tasted of his love, and have received a remission of your sins, which causeth such exceedingly great joy in your souls, even so I would that ye should remember, and always retain in remembrance, the greatness of God, and your own nothingness, and his goodness and long-suffering towards you, unworthy creatures, and humble yourselves even in the depths of humility, calling on the name of the Lord daily, and standing steadfastly in the faith of that which is to come, which was spoken by the mouth of the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.12'>And behold, I say unto you that if ye do this ye shall always rejoice, and be filled with the love of God, and always retain a remission of your sins; and ye shall grow in the knowledge of the glory of him that created you, or in the knowledge of that which is just and true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.13'>And ye will not have a mind to injure one another, but to live peaceably, and to render to every man according to that which is his due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.14'>And ye will not suffer your children that they go hungry, or naked; neither will ye suffer that they transgress the laws of God, and fight and quarrel one with another, and serve the devil, who is the master of sin, or who is the evil spirit which hath been spoken of by our fathers, he being an enemy to all righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.15'>But ye will teach them to walk in the ways of truth and soberness; ye will teach them to love one another, and to serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.16'>And also, ye yourselves will succor those that stand in need of your succor; ye will administer of your substance unto him that standeth in need; and ye will not suffer that the beggar putteth up his petition to you in vain, and turn him out to perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.17'>Perhaps thou shalt say: The man has brought upon himself his misery; therefore I will stay my hand, and will not give unto him of my food, nor impart unto him of my substance that he may not suffer, for his punishments are just-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.18'>But I say unto you, O man, whosoever doeth this the same hath great cause to repent; and except he repenteth of that which he hath done he perisheth forever, and hath no interest in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.19'>For behold, are we not all beggars? Do we not all depend upon the same Being, even God, for all the substance which we have, for both food and raiment, and for gold, and for silver, and for all the riches which we have of every kind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.20'>And behold, even at this time, ye have been calling on his name, and begging for a remission of your sins. And has he suffered that ye have begged in vain? Nay; he has poured out his Spirit upon you, and has caused that your hearts should be filled with joy, and has caused that your mouths should be stopped that ye could not find utterance, so exceedingly great was your joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.21'>And now, if God, who has created you, on whom you are dependent for your lives and for all that ye have and are, doth grant unto you whatsoever ye ask that is right, in faith, believing that ye shall receive, O then, how ye ought to impart of the substance that ye have one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.22'>And if ye judge the man who putteth up his petition to you for your substance that he perish not, and condemn him, how much more just will be your condemnation for withholding your substance, which doth not belong to you but to God, to whom also your life belongeth; and yet ye put up no petition, nor repent of the thing which thou hast done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.23'>I say unto you, wo be unto that man, for his substance shall perish with him; and now, I say these things unto those who are rich as pertaining to the things of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.24'>And again, I say unto the poor, ye who have not and yet have sufficient, that ye remain from day to day; I mean all you who deny the beggar, because ye have not; I would that ye say in your hearts that: I give not because I have not, but if I had I would give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.25'>And now, if ye say this in your hearts ye remain guiltless, otherwise ye are condemned; and your condemnation is just for ye covet that which ye have not received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.26'>And now, for the sake of these things which I have spoken unto you-that is, for the sake of retaining a remission of your sins from day to day, that ye may walk guiltless before God-I would that ye should impart of your substance to the poor, every man according to that which he hath, such as feeding the hungry, clothing the naked, visiting the sick and administering to their relief, both spiritually and temporally, according to their wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.27'>And see that all these things are done in wisdom and order; for it is not requisite that a man should run faster than he has strength. And again, it is expedient that he should be diligent, that thereby he might win the prize; therefore, all things must be done in order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.28'>And I would that ye should remember, that whosoever among you borroweth of his neighbor should return the thing that he borroweth, according as he doth agree, or else thou shalt commit sin; and perhaps thou shalt cause thy neighbor to commit sin also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.29'>And finally, I cannot tell you all the things whereby ye may commit sin; for there are divers ways and means, even so many that I cannot number them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.30'>But this much I can tell you, that if ye do not watch yourselves, and your thoughts, and your words, and your deeds, and observe the commandments of God, and continue in the faith of what ye have heard concerning the coming of our Lord, even unto the end of your lives, ye must perish. And now, O man, remember, and perish not.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.1'>AND now, it came to pass that when king Benjamin had thus spoken to his people, he sent among them, desiring to know of his people if they believed the words which he had spoken unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.2'>And they all cried with one voice, saying: Yea, we believe all the words which thou hast spoken unto us; and also, we know of their surety and truth, because of the Spirit of the Lord Omnipotent, which has wrought a mighty change in us, or in our hearts, that we have no more disposition to do evil, but to do good continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.3'>And we, ourselves, also, through the infinite goodness of God, and the manifestations of his Spirit, have great views of that which is to come; and were it expedient, we could prophesy of all things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.6'>And now, these are the words which king Benjamin desired of them; and therefore he said unto them: Ye have spoken the words that I desired; and the covenant which ye have made is a righteous covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.7'>And now, because of the covenant which ye have made ye shall be called the children of Christ, his sons, and his daughters; for behold, this day he hath spiritually begotten you; for ye say that your hearts are changed through faith on his name; therefore, ye are born of him and have become his sons and his daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.8'>And under this head ye are made free, and there is no other head whereby ye can be made free. There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore, I would that ye should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.9'>And it shall come to pass that whosoever doeth this shall be found at the right hand of God, for he shall know the name by which he is called; for he shall be called by the name of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.10'>And now it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall not take upon him the name of Christ must be called by some other name; therefore, he findeth himself on the left hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.11'>And I would that ye should remember also, that this is the name that I said I should give unto you that never should be blotted out, except it be through transgression; therefore, take heed that ye do not transgress, that the name be not blotted out of your hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.12'>I say unto you, I would that ye should remember to retain the name written always in your hearts, that ye are not found on the left hand of God, but that ye hear and know the voice by which ye shall be called, and also, the name by which he shall call you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.13'>For how knoweth a man the master whom he has not served, and who is a stranger unto him, and is far from the thoughts and intents of his heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.14'>And again, doth a man take an ass which belongeth to his neighbor, and keep him? I say unto you, Nay; he will not even suffer that he shall feed among his flocks, but will drive him away, and cast him out. I say unto you, that even so shall it be among you if ye know not the name by which ye are called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.5.15'>Therefore, I would that ye should be steadfast and immovable, always abounding in good works, that Christ, the Lord God Omnipotent, may seal you his, that you may be brought to heaven, that ye may have everlasting salvation and eternal life, through the wisdom, and power, and justice, and mercy of him who created all things, in heaven and in earth, who is God above all.

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.1'>AND now, it came to pass that after king Mosiah had had continual peace for the space of three years, he was desirous to know concerning the people who went up to dwell in the land of Lehi-Nephi, or in the city of Lehi-Nephi; for his people had heard nothing from them from the time they left the land of Zarahemla; therefore, they wearied him with their teasings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.2'>And it came to pass that *king Mosiah granted that sixteen of their strong men might go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi, to inquire concerning their brethren.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.4'>And now, they knew not the course they should travel in the wilderness to go up to the land of Lehi-Nephi; therefore they wandered many days in the wilderness, even forty days did they wander.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.5'>And when they had wandered forty days they came to a hill, which is north of the land of Shilom, and there they pitched their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.6'>And Ammon took three of his brethren, and their names were Amaleki, Helem, and Hem, and they went down into the land of Nephi.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.8'>And it came to pass when they had been in prison two days they were again brought before the king, and their bands were loosed; and they stood before the king, and were permitted, or rather commanded, that they should answer the questions which he should ask them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.9'>And he said unto them: Behold, I am Limhi, the son of Noah, who was the son of Zeniff, who came up out of the land of Zarahemla to inherit this land, which was the land of their fathers, who was made a king by the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.10'>And now, I desire to know the cause whereby ye were so bold as to come near the walls of the city, when I, myself, was with my guards without the gate?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.11'>And now, for this cause have I suffered that ye should be preserved, that I might inquire of you, or else I should have caused that my guards should have put you to death. Ye are permitted to speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.13'>For I am assured that if ye had known me ye would not have suffered that I should have worn these bands.

        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.14'>And now, it came to pass that after Limhi had heard the words of Ammon, he was exceedingly glad, and said: Now, I know of a surety that my brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla are yet alive. And now, I will rejoice; and on the morrow I will cause that my people shall rejoice also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.15'>For behold, we are in bondage to the Lamanites, and are taxed with a tax which is grievous to be borne. And now, behold, our brethren will deliver us out of our bondage, or out of the hands of the Lamanites, and we will be their slaves; for it is better that we be slaves to the Nephites than to pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.16'>And now, king Limhi commanded his guards that they should no more bind Ammon nor his brethren, but caused that they should go to the hill which was north of Shilom, and bring their brethren into the city, that thereby they might eat, and drink, and rest themselves from the labors of their journey; for they had suffered many things; they had suffered hunger, thirst, and fatigue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.17'>And now, it came to pass on the morrow that king Limhi sent a proclamation among all his people, that thereby they might gather themselves together to the temple, to hear the words which he should speak unto them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.19'>Therefore, lift up your heads, and rejoice, and put your trust in God, in that God who was the God of Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob; and also, that God who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt, and caused that they should walk through the Red Sea on dry ground, and fed them with manna that they might not perish in the wilderness; and many more things did he do for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.20'>And again, that same God has brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem, and has kept and preserved his people even until now; and behold, it is because of our iniquities and abominations that he has brought us into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.21'>And ye all are witnesses this day, that Zeniff, who was made king over this people, he being over-zealous to inherit the land of his fathers, therefore being deceived by the cunning and craftiness of king Laman, who having entered into a treaty with king Zeniff, and having yielded up into his hands the possessions of a part of the land, or even the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom; and the land round about-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.22'>And all this he did, for the sole purpose of bringing this people into subjection or into bondage. And behold, we at this time do pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites, to the amount of one half of our corn, and our barley, and even all our grain of every kind, and one half of the increase of our flocks and our herds; and even one half of all we have or possess the king of the Lamanites doth exact of us, or our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.23'>And now, is not this grievous to be borne? And is not this, our affliction, great? Now behold, how great reason we have to mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.24'>Yea, I say unto you, great are the reasons which we have to mourn; for behold how many of our brethren have been slain, and their blood has been spilt in vain, and all because of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.25'>For if this people had not fallen into transgression the Lord would not have suffered that this great evil should come upon them. But behold, they would not hearken unto his words; but there arose contentions among them, even so much that they did shed blood among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.26'>And a prophet of the Lord have they slain; yea, a chosen man of God, who told them of their wickedness and abominations, and prophesied of many things which are to come, yea, even the coming of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.27'>And because he said unto them that Christ was the God, the Father of all things, and said that he should take upon him the image of man, and it should be the image after which man was created in the beginning; or in other words, he said that man was created after the image of God, and that God should come down among the children of men, and take upon him flesh and blood, and go forth upon the face of the earth-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.28'>And now, because he said this, they did put him to death; and many more things did they do which brought down the wrath of God upon them. Therefore, who wondereth that they are in bondage, and that they are smitten with sore afflictions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.7.29'>For behold, the Lord hath said: I will not succor my people in the day of their transgression; but I will hedge up their ways that they prosper not; and their doings shall be as a stumbling block before them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.1'>AND it came to pass that after king Limhi had made an end of speaking to his people, for he spake many things unto them and only a few of them have I written in this book, he told his people all the things concerning their brethren who were in the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.2'>And he caused that Ammon should stand up before the multitude, and rehearse unto them all that had happened unto their brethren from the time that Zeniff went up out of the land even until the time that he himself came up out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.3'>And he also rehearsed unto them the last words which king Benjamin had taught them, and explained them to the people of king Limhi, so that they might understand all the words which he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.4'>And it came to pass that after he had done all this, that king Limhi dismissed the multitude, and caused that they should return every one unto his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.5'>And it came to pass that he caused that the plates which contained the record of his people from the time that they left the land of Zarahemla, should be brought before Ammon, that he might read them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.6'>Now, as soon as Ammon had read the record, the king inquired of him to know if he could interpret languages, and Ammon told him that he could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.7'>And the king said unto him: Being grieved for the afflictions of my people, I caused that forty and three of my people should take a journey into the wilderness, that thereby they might find the land of Zarahemla, that we might appeal unto our brethren to deliver us out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.8'>And they were lost in the wilderness for the space of many days, yet they were diligent, and found not the land of Zarahemla but returned to this land, having traveled in a land among many waters, having discovered a land which was covered with bones of men, and of beasts, and was also covered with ruins of buildings of every kind, having discovered a land which had been peopled with a people who were as numerous as the hosts of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.9'>And for a testimony that the things that they had said are true they have brought twenty-four plates which are filled with engravings, and they are of pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.10'>And behold, also, they have brought breastplates, which are large, and they are of brass and of copper, and are perfectly sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.11'>And again, they have brought swords, the hilts thereof have perished, and the blades thereof were cankered with rust; and there is no one in the land that is able to interpret the language or the engravings that are on the plates. Therefore I said unto thee: Canst thou translate?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.12'>And I say unto thee again: Knowest thou of any one that can translate? For I am desirous that these records should be translated into our language; for, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of a remnant of the people who have been destroyed, from whence these records came; or, perhaps, they will give us a knowledge of this very people who have been destroyed; and I am desirous to know the cause of their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.13'>Now Ammon said unto him: I can assuredly tell thee, O king, of a man that can translate the records; for he has wherewith that he can look, and translate all records that are of ancient date; and it is a gift from God. And the things are called interpreters, and no man can look in them except he be commanded, lest he should look for that he ought not and he should perish. And whosoever is commanded to look in them, the same is called seer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.14'>And behold, the king of the people who are in the land of Zarahemla is the man that is commanded to do these things, and who has this high gift from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.15'>And the king said that a seer is greater than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.16'>And Ammon said that a seer is a revelator and a prophet also; and a gift which is greater can no man have, except he should possess the power of God, which no man can; yet a man may have great power given him from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.17'>But a seer can know of things which are past, and also of things which are to come, and by them shall all things be revealed, or, rather, shall secret things be made manifest, and hidden things shall come to light, and things which are not known shall be made known by them, and also things shall be made known by them which otherwise could not be known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.18'>Thus God has provided a means that man, through faith, might work mighty miracles; therefore he becometh a great benefit to his fellow beings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.19'>And now, when Ammon had made an end of speaking these words the king rejoiced exceedingly, and gave thanks to God, saying: Doubtless a great mystery is contained within these plates, and these interpreters were doubtless prepared for the purpose of unfolding all such mysteries to the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.20'>O how marvelous are the works of the Lord, and how long doth he suffer with his people; yea, and how blind and impenetrable are the understandings of the children of men; for they will not seek wisdom, neither do they desire that she should rule over them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.8.21'>Yea, they are as a wild flock which fleeth from the shepherd, and scattereth, and are driven, and are devoured by the beasts of the forest.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.1'>I, Zeniff, having been taught in all the language of the Nephites, and having had a knowledge of the land of Nephi, or of the land of our fathers' first inheritance, *and having been sent as a spy among the Lamanites that I might spy out their forces, that our army might come upon them and destroy them-but when I saw that which was good among them I was desirous that they should not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.2'>Therefore, I contended with my brethren in the wilderness, for I would that our ruler should make a treaty with them; but he being an austere and a blood-thirsty man commanded that I should be slain; but I was rescued by the shedding of much blood; for father fought against father, and brother against brother, until the greater number of our army was destroyed in the wilderness; and we returned, those of us that were spared, to the land of Zarahemla, to relate that tale to their wives and their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.3'>And yet, I being over-zealous to inherit the land of our fathers, collected as many as were desirous to go up to possess the land, and started again on our journey into the wilderness to go up to the land; but we were smitten with famine and sore afflictions; for we were slow to remember the Lord our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.4'>Nevertheless, after many days' wandering in the wilderness we pitched our tents in the place where our brethren were slain, which was near to the land of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.5'>And it came to pass that I went again with four of my men into the city, in unto the king, that I might know of the disposition of the king, and that I might know if I might go in with my people and possess the land in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.6'>And I went in unto the king, and he covenanted with me that I might possess the land of Lehi-Nephi, and the land of Shilom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.7'>And he also commanded that his people should depart out of the land, and I and my people went into the land that we might possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.8'>And we began to build buildings, and to repair the walls of the city, yea, even the walls of the city of Lehi-Nephi, and the city of Shilom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.9'>And we began to till the ground, yea, even with all manner of seeds, with seeds of corn, and of wheat, and of barley, and with neas, and with sheum, and with seeds of all manner of fruits; and we did begin to multiply and prosper in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.10'>Now it was the cunning and the craftiness of king Laman, to bring my people into bondage, that he yielded up the land that we might possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.11'>Therefore it came to pass, that after we had dwelt in the land for the space of *twelve years that king Laman began to grow uneasy, lest by any means my people should wax strong in the land, and that they could not overpower them and bring them into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.12'>Now they were a lazy and an idolatrous people; therefore they were desirous to bring us into bondage, that they might glut themselves with the labors of our hands; yea, that they might feast themselves upon the flocks of our fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.13'>Therefore it came to pass that king Laman began to stir up his people that they should contend with my people; therefore there began to be wars and contentions in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.14'>For, in the *thirteenth year of my reign in the land of Nephi, away on the south of the land of Shilom, when my people were watering and feeding their flocks, and tilling their lands, a numerous host of Lamanites came upon them and began to slay them, and to take off their flocks, and the corn of their fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.15'>Yea, and it came to pass that they fled, all that were not overtaken, even into the city of Nephi, and did call upon me for protection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.16'>And it came to pass that I did arm them with bows, and with arrows, with swords, and with cimeters, and with clubs, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons which we could invent, and I and my people did go forth against the Lamanites to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.17'>Yea, in the strength of the Lord did we go forth to battle against the Lamanites; for I and my people did cry mightily to the Lord that he would deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, for we were awakened to a remembrance of the deliverance of our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.18'>And God did hear our cries and did answer our prayers; and we did go forth in his might; yea, we did go forth against the Lamanites, and in one day and a night we did slay three thousand and forty-three; we did slay them even until we had driven them out of our land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.9.19'>And I, myself, with mine own hands, did help to bury their dead. And behold, to our great sorrow and lamentation, two hundred and seventy-nine of our brethren were slain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.1'>AND it came to pass that we again began to establish the kingdom and we again began to possess the land in peace. And I caused that there should be weapons of war made of every kind, that thereby I might have weapons for my people against the time the Lamanites should come up again to war against my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.2'>And I set guards round about the land, that the Lamanites might not come upon us again unawares and destroy us; and thus I did guard my people and my flocks, and keep them from falling into the hands of our enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.3'>And it came to pass that we did inherit the land of our fathers for many years, yea, *for the space of twenty and two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.4'>And I did cause that the men should till the ground, and raise all manner of grain and all manner of fruit of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.5'>And I did cause that the women should spin, and toil, and work, and work all manner of fine linen, yea, and cloth of every kind, that we might clothe our nakedness; and thus we did prosper in the land-thus we did have continual peace in the land for the space of twenty and two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.6'>And it came to pass that king Laman died, and his son began to reign in his stead. And he began to stir his people up in rebellion against my people; therefore they began to prepare for war, and to come up to battle against my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.7'>But I had sent my spies out round about the land of Shemlon, that I might discover their preparations, that I might guard against them, that they might not come upon my people and destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.8'>And it came to pass that they came up upon the north of the land of Shilom, with their numerous hosts, men armed with bows, and with arrows, and with swords, and with cimeters, and with stones, and with slings; and they had their heads shaved that they were naked; and they were girded with a leathern girdle about their loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.9'>And it came to pass that I caused that the women and children of my people should be hid in the wilderness; and I also caused that all my old men that could bear arms, and also all my young men that were able to bear arms, should gather themselves together to go to battle against the Lamanites; and I did place them in their ranks, every man according to his age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.10'>And it came to pass that we did go up to battle against the Lamanites; and I, even I, in my old age, did go up to battle against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that we did go up in the strength of the Lord to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.11'>Now, the Lamanites knew nothing concerning the Lord, nor the strength of the Lord, therefore they depended upon their own strength. Yet they were a strong people, as to the strength of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.12'>They were a wild, and ferocious, and a blood-thirsty people, believing in the tradition of their fathers, which is this-Believing that they were driven out of the land of Jerusalem because of the iniquities of their fathers, and that they were wronged in the wilderness by their brethren, and they were also wronged while crossing the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.13'>And again, that they were wronged while in the land of their first inheritance, after they had crossed the sea, and all this because that Nephi was more faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord-therefore he was favored of the Lord, for the Lord heard his prayers and answered them, and he took the lead of their journey in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.14'>And his brethren were wroth with him because they understood not the dealings of the Lord; they were also wroth with him upon the waters because they hardened their hearts against the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.15'>And again, they were wroth with him when they had arrived in the promised land, because they said that he had taken the ruling of the people out of their hands; and they sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.16'>And again, they were wroth with him because he departed into the wilderness as the Lord had commanded him, and took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, for they said that he robbed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.17'>And thus they have taught their children that they should hate them, and that they should murder them, and that they should rob and plunder them, and do all they could to destroy them; therefore they have an eternal hatred towards the children of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.18'>For this very cause has king Laman, by his cunning, and lying craftiness, and his fair promises, deceived me, that I have brought this my people up into this land, that they may destroy them; yea, and we have suffered these many years in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.19'>And now I, Zeniff, after having told all these things unto my people concerning the Lamanites, I did stimulate them to go to battle with their might, putting their trust in the Lord; therefore, we did contend with them, face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.20'>And it came to pass that we did drive them again out of our land; and we slew them with a great slaughter, even so many that we did not number them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.10.21'>And it came to pass that we returned again to our own land, and my people again began to tend their flocks, and to till their ground.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.1'>AND now it came to pass that Zeniff conferred the kingdom upon Noah, one of his sons; therefore Noah began to reign in his stead; and he did not walk in the ways of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.2'>For behold, he did not keep the commandments of God, but he did walk after the desires of his own heart. And he had many wives and concubines. And he did cause his people to commit sin, and do that which was abominable in the sight of the Lord. Yea, and they did commit whoredoms and all manner of wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.3'>And he laid a tax of one fifth part of all they possessed, a fifth part of their gold and of their silver, and a fifth part of their ziff, and of their copper, and of their brass and their iron; and a fifth part of their fatlings; and also a fifth part of all their grain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.7'>Yea, and they also became idolatrous, because they were deceived by the vain and flattering words of the king and priests; for they did speak flattering things unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.8'>And it came to pass that king Noah built many elegant and spacious buildings; and he ornamented them with fine work of wood, and of all manner of precious things, of gold, and of silver, and of iron, and of brass, and of ziff, and of copper;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.9'>And he also built him a spacious palace, and a throne in the midst thereof, all of which was of fine wood and was ornamented with gold and silver and with precious things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.10'>And he also caused that his workmen should work all manner of fine work within the walls of the temple, of fine wood, and of copper, and of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.11'>And the seats which were set apart for the high priests, which were above all the other seats, he did ornament with pure gold; and he caused a breastwork to be built before them, that they might rest their bodies and their arms upon while they should speak lying and vain words to his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.12'>And it came to pass that he built a tower near the temple; yea, a very high tower, even so high that he could stand upon the top thereof and overlook the land of Shilom, and also the land of Shemlon, which was possessed by the Lamanites; and he could even look over all the land round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.13'>And it came to pass that he caused many buildings to be built in the land Shilom; and he caused a great tower to be built on the hill north of the land Shilom, which had been a resort for the children of Nephi at the time they fled out of the land; and thus he did do with the riches which he obtained by the taxation of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.14'>And it came to pass that he placed his heart upon his riches, and he spent his time in riotous living with his wives and his concubines; and so did also his priests spend their time with harlots.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.26'>Now it came to pass that when Abinadi had spoken these words unto them they were wroth with him, and sought to take away his life; but the Lord delivered him out of their hands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.28'>I command you to bring Abinadi hither, that I may slay him, for he has said these things that he might stir up my people to anger one with another, and to raise contentions among my people; therefore I will slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.11.29'>Now the eyes of the people were blinded; therefore they hardened their hearts against the words of Abinadi, and they sought from that time forward to take him.

        <verse osisID='Ruth.12.20'>And it came to pass that one of them said unto him: What meaneth the words which are written, and which have been taught by our fathers, saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.5'>And it came to pass that the king caused that his guards should surround Abinadi and take him; and they bound him and cast him into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.6'>And after three days, having counseled with his priests, he caused that he should again be brought before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.7'>And he said unto him: Abinadi, we have found an accusation against thee, and thou art worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.8'>For thou hast said that God himself should come down among the children of men; and now, for this cause thou shalt be put to death unless thou wilt recall all the words which thou hast spoken evil concerning me and my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.9'>Now Abinadi said unto him: I say unto you, I will not recall the words which I have spoken unto you concerning this people, for they are true; and that ye may know of their surety I have suffered myself that I have fallen into your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.10'>Yea, and I will suffer even until death, and I will not recall my words, and they shall stand as a testimony against you. And if ye slay me ye will shed innocent blood, and this shall also stand as a testimony against you at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.11'>And now king Noah was about to release him, for he feared his word; for he feared that the judgments of God would come upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.12'>But the priests lifted up their voices against him, and began to accuse him, saying: He has reviled the king. Therefore the king was stirred up in anger against him, and he delivered him up that he might be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.13'>And it came to pass that they took him and bound him, and scourged his skin with faggots, yea, even unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.14'>And now when the flames began to scorch him, he cried unto them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.15'>Behold, even as ye have done unto me, so shall it come to pass that thy seed shall cause that many shall suffer the pains that I do suffer, even the pains of death by fire; and this because they believe in the salvation of the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.16'>And it will come to pass that ye shall be afflicted with all manner of diseases because of your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.17'>Yea, and ye shall be smitten on every hand, and shall be driven and scattered to and fro, even as a wild flock is driven by wild and ferocious beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.18'>And in that day ye shall be hunted, and ye shall be taken by the hand of your enemies, and then ye shall suffer, as I suffer, the pains of death by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.19'>Thus God executeth vengeance upon those that destroy his people. O God, receive my soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.17.20'>And now, *when Abinadi had said these words, he fell, having suffered death by fire; yea, having been put to death because he would not deny the commandments of God, having sealed the truth of his words by his death.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.18'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.1'>AND now, it came to pass that Alma, who had fled from the servants of king Noah, repented of his sins and iniquities, and went about privately among the people, and began to teach the words of Abinadi-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.2'>Yea, concerning that which was to come, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and the redemption of the people, which was to be brought to pass through the power, and sufferings, and death of Christ, and his resurrection and ascension into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.3'>And as many as would hear his word he did teach. And he taught them privately, that it might not come to the knowledge of the king. And many did believe his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.4'>And it came to pass that as many as did believe him did go forth to a place which was called Mormon, having received its name from the king, being in the borders of the land having been infested, by times or at seasons, by wild beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.5'>Now, there was in Mormon a fountain of pure water, and Alma resorted thither, there being near the water a thicket of small trees, where he did hide himself in the daytime from the searches of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.6'>And it came to pass that as many as believed him went thither to hear his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.7'>And it came to pass *after many days there were a goodly number gathered together at the place of Mormon, to hear the words of Alma. Yea, all were gathered together that believed on his word, to hear him. And he did teach them, and did preach unto them repentance, and redemption, and faith on the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.8'>And it came to pass that he said unto them: Behold, here are the waters of Mormon (for thus were they called) and now, as ye are desirous to come into the fold of God, and to be called his people, and are willing to bear one another's burdens, that they may be light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.9'>Yea, and are willing to mourn with those that mourn; yea, and comfort those that stand in need of comfort, and to stand as witnesses of God at all times and in all things, and in all places that ye may be in, even until death, that ye may be redeemed of God, and be numbered with those of the first resurrection, that ye may have eternal life-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.10'>Now I say unto you, if this be the desire of your hearts, what have you against being baptized in the name of the Lord, as a witness before him that ye have entered into a covenant with him, that ye will serve him and keep his commandments, that he may pour out his Spirit more abundantly upon you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.11'>And now when the people had heard these words, they clapped their hands for joy, and exclaimed: This is the desire of our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.12'>And now it came to pass that Alma took Helam, he being one of the first, and went and stood forth in the water, and cried, saying: O Lord, pour out thy Spirit upon thy servant, that he may do this work with holiness of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.13'>And when he had said these words, the Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he said: Helam, I baptize thee, having authority from the Almighty God, as a testimony that ye have entered into a covenant to serve him until you are dead as to the mortal body; and may the Spirit of the Lord be poured out upon you; and may he grant unto you eternal life, through the redemption of Christ, whom he has prepared from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.14'>And after Alma had said these words, both Alma and Helam were buried in the water; and they arose and came forth out of the water rejoicing, being filled with the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.15'>And again, Alma took another, and went forth a second time into the water, and baptized him according to the first, only he did not bury himself again in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.16'>And after this manner he did baptize every one that went forth to the place of Mormon; and they were in number about two hundred and four souls; yea, and they were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were filled with the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.17'>And they were called the church of God, or the church of Christ, from that time forward. And it came to pass that whosoever was baptized by the power and authority of God was added to his church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.18'>And it came to pass that Alma, having authority from God, ordained priests; even one priest to every fifty of their number did he ordain to preach unto them, and to teach them concerning the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.19'>And he commanded them that they should teach nothing save it were the things which he had taught, and which had been spoken by the mouth of the holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.20'>Yea, even he commanded them that they should preach nothing save it were repentance and faith on the Lord, who had redeemed his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.21'>And he commanded them that there should be no contention one with another, but that they should look forward with one eye, having one faith and one baptism, having their hearts knit together in unity and in love one towards another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.22'>And thus he commanded them to preach. And thus they became the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.23'>And he commanded them that they should observe the sabbath day, and keep it holy, and also every day they should give thanks to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.24'>And he also commanded them that the priests whom he had ordained should labor with their own hands for their support.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.25'>And there was one day in every week that was set apart that they should gather themselves together to teach the people, and to worship the Lord their God, and also, as often as it was in their power, to assemble themselves together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.26'>And the priests were not to depend upon the people for their support; but for their labor they were to receive the grace of God, that they might wax strong in the Spirit, having the knowledge of God, that they might teach with power and authority from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.27'>And again Alma commanded that the people of the church should impart of their substance, every one according to that which he had; if he have more abundantly he should impart more abundantly; and of him that had but little, but little should be required; and to him that had not should be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.28'>And thus they should impart of their substance of their own free will and good desires towards God, and to those priests that stood in need, yea, and to every needy, naked soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.29'>And this he said unto them, having been commanded of God; and they did walk uprightly before God, imparting to one another both temporally and spiritually according to their needs and their wants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.30'>And now it came to pass that all this was done in Mormon, yea, by the waters of Mormon, in the forest that was near the waters of Mormon; yea, the place of Mormon, the waters of Mormon, the forest of Mormon, how beautiful are they to the eyes of them who there came to the knowledge of their Redeemer; yea, and how blessed are they, for they shall sing to his praise forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.31'>And these things were done in the borders of the land, that they might not come to the knowledge of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.32'>But behold, it came to pass that the king, having discovered a movement among the people, sent his servants to watch them. Therefore on the day that they were assembling themselves together to hear the word of the Lord they were discovered unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.33'>And now the king said that Alma was stirring up the people to rebellion against him; therefore he sent his army to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.18.34'>And it came to pass that Alma and the people of the Lord were apprised of the coming of the king's army; therefore they took their tents and their families and departed into the wilderness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.3'>And the lesser part began to breathe out threatenings against the king, and there began to be a great contention among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.4'>And now there was a man among them whose name was Gideon, and he being a strong man and an enemy to the king, therefore he drew his sword, and swore in his wrath that he would slay the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.5'>And it came to pass that he fought with the king; and when the king saw that he was about to overpower him, he fled and ran and got upon the tower which was near the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.6'>And Gideon pursued after him and was about to get upon the tower to slay the king, and the king cast his eyes round about towards the land of Shemlon, and behold, the army of the Lamanites were within the borders of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.7'>And now the king cried out in the anguish of his soul, saying: Gideon, spare me, for the Lamanites are upon us, and they will destroy us; yea, they will destroy my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.8'>And now the king was not so much concerned about his people as he was about his own life; nevertheless, Gideon did spare his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.9'>And the king commanded the people that they should flee before the Lamanites, and he himself did go before them, and they did flee into the wilderness, with their women and their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.10'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites did pursue them, and did overtake them, and began to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.11'>Now it came to pass that the king commanded them that all the men should leave their wives and their children, and flee before the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.12'>Now there were many that would not leave them, but had rather stay and perish with them. And the rest left their wives and their children and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.13'>And it came to pass that those who tarried with their wives and their children caused that their fair daughters should stand forth and plead with the Lamanites that they would not slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.14'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites had compassion on them, for they were charmed with the beauty of their women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.15'>Therefore the Lamanites did spare their lives, and took them captives and carried them back to the land of Nephi, and granted unto them that they might possess the land, under the conditions that they would deliver up king Noah into the hands of the Lamanites, and deliver up their property, even one half of all they possessed, one half of their gold, and their silver, and all their precious things, and thus they should pay tribute to the king of the Lamanites from year to year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.19.16'>And now there was one of the sons of the king among those that were taken captive, whose name was Limhi.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.15'>And now the Lord was slow to hear their cry because of their iniquities; nevertheless the Lord did hear their cries, and began to soften the hearts of the Lamanites that they began to ease their burdens; yet the Lord did not see fit to deliver them out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.16'>And it came to pass that they began to prosper by degrees in the land, and began to raise grain more abundantly, and flocks, and herds, that they did not suffer with hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.17'>Now there was a great number of women, more than there was of men; therefore king Limhi commanded that every man should impart to the support of the widows and their children, that they might not perish with hunger; and this they did because of the greatness of their number that had been slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.18'>Now the people of Limhi kept together in a body as much as it was possible, and secured their grain and their flocks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.19'>And the king himself did not trust his person without the walls of the city, unless he took his guards with him, fearing that he might by some means fall into the hands of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.20'>And he caused that his people should watch the land round about, that by some means they might take those priests that fled into the wilderness, who had stolen the daughters of the Lamanites, and that had caused such a great destruction to come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.21'>For they were desirous to take them that they might punish them; for they had come into the land of Nephi by night, and carried off their grain and many of their precious things; therefore they laid wait for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.22'>And it came to pass that there was no more disturbance between the Lamanites and the people of Limhi, *even until the time that Ammon and his brethren came into the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.23'>And the king having been without the gates of the city with his guard, discovered Ammon and his brethren; and supposing them to be priests of Noah therefore he caused that they should be taken, and bound, and cast into prison. And had they been the priests of Noah he would have caused that they should be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.24'>But when he found that they were not, but that they were his brethren, and had come from the land of Zarahemla, he was filled with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.25'>Now king Limhi had sent, previous to the coming of Ammon, a small number of men to search for the land of Zarahemla; but they could not find it, and they were lost in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.26'>Nevertheless, they did find a land which had been peopled; yea, a land which was covered with dry bones; yea, a land which had been peopled and which had been destroyed; and they, having supposed it to be the land of Zarahemla, returned to the land of Nephi, having arrived in the borders of the land not many days before the coming of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.27'>And they brought a record with them, even a record of the people whose bones they had found; and it was engraven on plates of ore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.28'>And now Limhi was again filled with joy on learning from the mouth of Ammon that king Mosiah had a gift from God, whereby he could interpret such engravings; yea, and Ammon also did rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.29'>Yet Ammon and his brethren were filled with sorrow because so many of their brethren had been slain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.30'>And also that king Noah and his priests had caused the people to commit so many sins and iniquities against God; and they also did mourn for the death of Abinadi; and also for the departure of Alma and the people that went with him, who had formed a church of God through the strength and power of God, and faith on the words which had been spoken by Abinadi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.31'>Yea, they did mourn for their departure, for they knew not whither they had fled. Now they would have gladly joined with them, for they themselves had entered into a covenant with God to serve him and keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.32'>And now since the coming of Ammon, king Limhi had also entered into a covenant with God, and also many of his people, to serve him and keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.33'>And it came to pass that king Limhi and many of his people were desirous to be baptized; but there was none in the land that had authority from God. And Ammon declined doing this thing, considering himself an unworthy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.34'>Therefore they did not at that time form themselves into a church, waiting upon the Spirit of the Lord. Now they were desirous to become even as Alma and his brethren, who had fled into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.35'>They were desirous to be baptized as a witness and a testimony that they were willing to serve God with all their hearts; nevertheless they did prolong the time; and an account of their baptism shall be given hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.21.36'>And now all the study of Ammon and his people, and king Limhi and his people, was to deliver themselves out of the hands of the Lamanites and from bondage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.22'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.1'>AND now it came to pass that Ammon and king Limhi began to consult with the people how they should deliver themselves out of bondage; and even they did cause that all the people should gather themselves together; and this they did that they might have the voice of the people concerning the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.2'>And it came to pass that they could find no way to deliver themselves out of bondage, except it were to take their women and children, and their flocks, and their herds, and their tents, and depart into the wilderness; for the Lamanites being so numerous, it was impossible for the people of Limhi to contend with them, thinking to deliver themselves out of bondage by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.3'>Now it came to pass that Gideon went forth and stood before the king, and said unto him: Now O king, thou hast hitherto hearkened unto my words many times when we have been contending with our brethren, the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.4'>And now O king, if thou hast not found me to be an unprofitable servant, or if thou hast hitherto listened to my words in any degree, and they have been of service to thee, even so I desire that thou wouldst listen to my words at this time, and I will be thy servant and deliver this people out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.5'>And the king granted unto him that he might speak. And Gideon said unto him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.6'>Behold the back pass, through the back wall, on the back side of the city. The Lamanites, or the guards of the Lamanites, by night are drunken; therefore let us send a proclamation among all this people that they gather together their flocks and herds, that they may drive them into the wilderness by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.7'>And I will go according to thy command and pay the last tribute of wine to the Lamanites, and they will be drunken; and we will pass through the secret pass on the left of their camp when they are drunken and asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.8'>Thus we will depart with our women and our children, our flocks, and our herds into the wilderness; and we will travel around the land of Shilom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.9'>And it came to pass that the king hearkened unto the words of Gideon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.10'>And king Limhi caused that his people should gather their flocks together; and he sent the tribute of wine to the Lamanites; and he also sent more wine, as a present unto them; and they did drink freely of the wine which king Limhi did send unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.11'>And it came to pass that the people of king Limhi did depart by night into the wilderness with their flocks and their herds, and they went round about the land of Shilom in the wilderness, and bent their course towards the land of Zarahemla, being led by Ammon and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.12'>And they had taken all their gold, and silver, and their precious things, which they could carry, and also their provisions with them, into the wilderness; and they pursued their journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.13'>And after being many days in the wilderness they arrived in the land of Zarahemla, and joined Mosiah's people, and became his subjects.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.14'>And it came to pass that Mosiah received them with joy; and he also received their records, and also the records which had been found by the people of Limhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.15'>And now it came to pass when the Lamanites had found that the people of Limhi had departed out of the land by night, that they sent an army into the wilderness to pursue them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.22.16'>And after they had pursued them two days, they could no longer follow their tracks; therefore they were lost in the wilderness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.7'>But he said unto them: Behold, it is not expedient that we should have a king; for thus saith the Lord: Ye shall not esteem one flesh above another, or one man shall not think himself above another; therefore I say unto you it is not expedient that ye should have a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.8'>Nevertheless, if it were possible that ye could always have just men to be your kings it would be well for you to have a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.9'>But remember the iniquity of king Noah and his priests; and I myself was caught in a snare, and did many things which were abominable in the sight of the Lord, which caused me sore repentance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.10'>Nevertheless, after much tribulation, the Lord did hear my cries, and did answer my prayers, and has made me an instrument in his hands in bringing so many of you to a knowledge of his truth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.12'>And now I say unto you, ye have been oppressed by king Noah, and have been in bondage to him and his priests, and have been brought into iniquity by them; therefore ye were bound with the bands of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.13'>And now as ye have been delivered by the power of God out of these bonds; yea, even out of the hands of king Noah and his people, and also from the bonds of iniquity, even so I desire that ye should stand fast in this liberty wherewith ye have been made free, and that ye trust no man to be a king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.14'>And also trust no one to be your teacher nor your minister, except he be a man of God, walking in his ways and keeping his commandments.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.27'>But Alma went forth and stood among them, and exhorted them that they should not be frightened, but that they should remember the Lord their God and he would deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.28'>Therefore they hushed their fears, and began to cry unto the Lord that he would soften the hearts of the Lamanites, that they would spare them, and their wives, and their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.29'>And it came to pass that the Lord did soften the hearts of the Lamanites. And Alma and his brethren went forth and delivered themselves up into their hands; and the Lamanites took possession of the land of Helam.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.35'>And Amulon and his brethren did join the Lamanites, and they were traveling in the wilderness in search of the land of Nephi when they discovered the land of Helam, which was possessed by Alma and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.36'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites promised unto Alma and his brethren, that if they would show them the way which led to the land of Nephi that they would grant unto them their lives and their liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.37'>But after Alma had shown them the way that led to the land of Nephi the Lamanites would not keep their promise; but they set guards round about the land of Helam, over Alma and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.38'>And the remainder of them went to the land of Nephi; and a part of them returned to the land of Helam, and also brought with them the wives and the children of the guards who had been left in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.23.39'>And the king of the Lamanites had granted unto Amulon that he should be a king and a ruler over his people, who were in the land of Helam; nevertheless he should have no power to do anything contrary to the will of the king of the Lamanites.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ruth.24'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.1'>AND it came to pass that Amulon did gain favor in the eyes of the king of the Lamanites; therefore, the king of the Lamanites granted unto him and his brethren that they should be appointed teachers over his people, yea, even over the people who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the land of Shilom, and in the land of Amulon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.2'>For the Lamanites had taken possession of all these lands; therefore, the king of the Lamanites had appointed kings over all these lands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.5'>And they were a people friendly one with another; nevertheless they knew not God; neither did the brethren of Amulon teach them anything concerning the Lord their God, neither the law of Moses; nor did they teach them the words of Abinadi;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.6'>But they taught them that they should keep their record, and that they might write one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.7'>And thus the Lamanites began to increase in riches, and began to trade one with another and wax great, and began to be a cunning and a wise people, as to the wisdom of the world, yea, a very cunning people, delighting in all manner of wickedness and plunder, except it were among their own brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.8'>And now it came to pass that Amulon began to exercise authority over Alma and his brethren, and began to persecute him, and cause that his children should persecute their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.9'>For Amulon knew Alma, that he had been one of the king's priests, and that it was he that believed the words of Abinadi and was driven out before the king, and therefore he was wroth with him; for he was subject to king Laman, yet he exercised authority over them, and put tasks upon them, and put task-masters over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.10'>And it came to pass that so great were their afflictions that they began to cry mightily to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.11'>And Amulon commanded them that they should stop their cries; and he put guards over them to watch them, that whosoever should be found calling upon God should be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.12'>And Alma and his people did not raise their voices to the Lord their God, but did pour out their hearts to him; and he did know the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.13'>And it came to pass that the voice of the Lord came to them in their afflictions, saying: Lift up your heads and be of good comfort, for I know of the covenant which ye have made unto me; and I will covenant with my people and deliver them out of bondage.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.15'>And now it came to pass that the burdens which were laid upon Alma and his brethren were made light; yea, the Lord did strengthen them that they could bear up their burdens with ease, and they did submit cheerfully and with patience to all the will of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.16'>And it came to pass that so great was their faith and their patience that the voice of the Lord came unto them again, saying: Be of good comfort, for on the morrow I will deliver you out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.17'>And he said unto Alma: Thou shalt go before this people, and I will go with thee and deliver this people out of bondage.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.23'>And now the Lord said unto Alma: Haste thee and get thou and this people out of this land, for the Lamanites have awakened and do pursue thee; therefore get thee out of this land, and I will stop the Lamanites in this valley that they come no further in pursuit of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.24.24'>And it came to pass that they departed out of the valley, and took their journey into the wilderness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.10'>And again, when they thought of the immediate goodness of God, and his power in delivering Alma and his brethren out of the hands of the Lamanites and of bondage, they did raise their voices and give thanks to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.12'>And it came to pass that those who were the children of Amulon and his brethren, who had taken to wife the daughters of the Lamanites, were displeased with the conduct of their fathers, and they would no longer be called by the names of their fathers, therefore they took upon themselves the name of Nephi, that they might be called the children of Nephi and be numbered among those who were called Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.13'>And now all the people of Zarahemla were numbered with the Nephites, and this because the kingdom had been conferred upon none but those who were descendants of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.14'>And now it came to pass that when Mosiah had made an end of speaking and reading to the people, he desired that Alma should also speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.15'>And Alma did speak unto them, when they were assembled together in large bodies, and he went from one body to another, preaching unto the people repentance and faith on the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.17'>And it came to pass that after Alma had taught the people many things, and had made an end of speaking to them, that king Limhi was desirous that he might be baptized; and all his people were desirous that they might be baptized also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.18'>Therefore, Alma did go forth into the water and did baptize them; yea, he did baptize them after the manner he did his brethren in the waters of Mormon; yea, and as many as he did baptize did belong to the church of God; and this because of their belief on the words of Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.19'>And it came to pass that king Mosiah granted unto Alma that he might establish churches throughout all the land of Zarahemla; and gave him power to ordain priests and teachers over every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.20'>Now this was done because there were so many people that they could not all be governed by one teacher; neither could they all hear the word of God in one assembly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.21'>Therefore they did assemble themselves together in different bodies, being called churches; every church having their priests and their teachers, and every priest preaching the word according as it was delivered to him by the mouth of Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.22'>And thus, notwithstanding there being many churches they were all one church, yea, even the church of God; for there was nothing preached in all the churches except it were repentance and faith in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.23'>And now there were seven churches in the land of Zarahemla. And it came to pass that whosoever were desirous to take upon them the name of Christ, or of God, they did join the churches of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.25.24'>And they were called the people of God. And the Lord did pour out his Spirit upon them, and they were blessed, and prospered in the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.26'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.1'>NOW it came to pass that there were many of the rising generation that could not understand the words of king Benjamin, being little children at the time he spake unto his people; and they did not believe the tradition of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.2'>They did not believe what had been said concerning the resurrection of the dead, neither did they believe concerning the coming of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.3'>And now because of their unbelief they could not understand the word of God; and their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.4'>And they would not be baptized; neither would they join the church. And they were a separate people as to their faith, and remained so ever after, even in their carnal and sinful state; for they would not call upon the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.5'>And now in the reign of Mosiah they were not half so numerous as the people of God; but because of the dissensions among the brethren they became more numerous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.6'>For it came to pass that they did deceive many with their flattering words, who were in the church, and did cause them to commit many sins; therefore it became expedient that those who committed sin, that were in the church, should be admonished by the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.7'>And it came to pass that they were brought before the priests, and delivered up unto the priests by the teachers; and the priests brought them before Alma, who was the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.8'>Now king Mosiah had given Alma the authority over the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.9'>And it came to pass that Alma did not know concerning them; but there were many witnesses against them; yea, the people stood and testified of their iniquity in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.10'>Now there had not any such thing happened before in the church; therefore Alma was troubled in his spirit, and he caused that they should be brought before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.11'>And he said unto the king: Behold, here are many whom we have brought before thee, who are accused of their brethren; yea, and they have been taken in divers iniquities. And they do not repent of their iniquities; therefore we have brought them before thee, that thou mayest judge them according to their crimes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.12'>But king Mosiah said unto Alma: Behold, I judge them not; therefore I deliver them into thy hands to be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.13'>And now the spirit of Alma was again troubled; and he went and inquired of the Lord what he should do concerning this matter, for he feared that he should do wrong in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.14'>And it came to pass that after he had poured out his whole soul to God, the voice of the Lord came to him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.15'>Blessed art thou, Alma, and blessed are they who were baptized in the waters of Mormon. Thou art blessed because of thy exceeding faith in the words alone of my servant Abinadi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.16'>And blessed are they because of their exceeding faith in the words alone which thou hast spoken unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.17'>And blessed art thou because thou hast established a church among this people; and they shall be established, and they shall be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.18'>Yea, blessed is this people who are willing to bear my name; for in my name shall they be called; and they are mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.19'>And because thou hast inquired of me concerning the transgressor, thou art blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.20'>Thou art my servant; and I covenant with thee that thou shalt have eternal life; and thou shalt serve me and go forth in my name, and shalt gather together my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.21'>And he that will hear my voice shall be my sheep; and him shall ye receive into the church, and him will I also receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.22'>For behold, this is my church; whosoever is baptized shall be baptized unto repentance. And whomsoever ye receive shall believe in my name; and him will I freely forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.23'>For it is I that taketh upon me the sins of the world; for it is I that hath created them; and it is I that granteth unto him that believeth unto the end a place at my right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.24'>For behold, in my name are they called; and if they know me they shall come forth, and shall have a place eternally at my right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.25'>And it shall come to pass that when the second trump shall sound then shall they that never knew me come forth and shall stand before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.26'>And then shall they know that I am the Lord their God, that I am their Redeemer; but they would not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.27'>And then I will confess unto them that I never knew them; and they shall depart into everlasting fire prepared for the devil and his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.28'>Therefore I say unto you, that he that will not hear my voice, the same shall ye not receive into my church, for him I will not receive at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.29'>Therefore I say unto you, Go; and whosoever transgresseth against me, him shall ye judge according to the sins which he has committed; and if he confess his sins before thee and me, and repenteth in the sincerity of his heart, him shall ye forgive, and I will forgive him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.30'>Yea, and as often as my people repent will I forgive them their trespasses against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.31'>And ye shall also forgive one another your trespasses; for verily I say unto you, he that forgiveth not his neighbor's trespasses when he says that he repents, the same hath brought himself under condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.32'>Now I say unto you, Go; and whosoever will not repent of his sins the same shall not be numbered among my people; and this shall be observed from this time forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.33'>And it came to pass when Alma had heard these words he wrote them down that he might have them, and that he might judge the people of that church according to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.34'>And it came to pass that Alma went and judged those that had been taken in iniquity, according to the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.35'>And whosoever repented of their sins and did confess them, them he did number among the people of the church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.36'>And those that would not confess their sins and repent of their iniquity, the same were not numbered among the people of the church, and their names were blotted out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.37'>And it came to pass that Alma did regulate all the affairs of the church; and they began again to have peace and to prosper exceedingly in the affairs of the church, walking circumspectly before God, receiving many, and baptizing many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.38'>And now all these things did Alma and his fellow laborers do who were over the church, walking in all diligence, teaching the word of God in all things, suffering all manner of afflictions, being persecuted by all those who did not belong to the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.26.39'>And they did admonish their brethren; and they were also admonished, every one by the word of God, according to his sins, or to the sins which he had committed, being commanded of God to pray without ceasing, and to give thanks in all things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.27'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.1'>AND now it came to pass that the persecutions which were inflicted on the church by the unbelievers became so great that the church began to murmur, and complain to their leaders concerning the matter; and they did complain to Alma. And Alma laid the case before their king, Mosiah. And Mosiah consulted with his priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.2'>And it came to pass that king Mosiah sent a proclamation throughout the land round about that there should not any unbeliever persecute any of those who belonged to the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.3'>And there was a strict command throughout all the churches that there should be no persecutions among them, that there should be an equality among all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.4'>That they should let no pride nor haughtiness disturb their peace; that every man should esteem his neighbor as himself, laboring with their own hands for their support.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.5'>Yea, and all their priests and teachers should labor with their own hands for their support, in all cases save it were in sickness, or in much want; and doing these things, they did abound in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.6'>And there began to be much peace again in the land; and the people began to be very numerous, and began to scatter abroad upon the face of the earth, yea, on the north and on the south, on the east and on the west, building large cities and villages in all quarters of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.7'>And the Lord did visit them and prosper them, and they became a large and wealthy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.8'>Now the sons of Mosiah were numbered among the unbelievers; and also one of the sons of Alma was numbered among them, he being called Alma, after his father; nevertheless, he became a very wicked and an idolatrous man. And he was a man of many words, and did speak much flattery to the people; therefore he led many of the people to do after the manner of his iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.9'>And he became a great hinderment to the prosperity of the church of God; stealing away the hearts of the people; causing much dissension among the people; giving a chance for the enemy of God to exercise his power over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.10'>And now it came to pass that while he was going about to destroy the church of God, for he did go about secretly with the sons of Mosiah seeking to destroy the church, and to lead astray the people of the Lord, contrary to the commandments of God, or even the king-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.11'>And as I said unto you, as they were going about rebelling against God, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared unto them; and he descended as it were in a cloud; and he spake as it were with a voice of thunder, which caused the earth to shake upon which they stood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.12'>And so great was their astonishment, that they fell to the earth, and understood not the words which he spake unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.13'>Nevertheless he cried again, saying: Alma, arise and stand forth, for why persecutest thou the church of God? For the Lord hath said: This is my church, and I will establish it; and nothing shall overthrow it, save it is the transgression of my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.14'>And again, the angel said: Behold, the Lord hath heard the prayers of his people, and also the prayers of his servant, Alma, who is thy father; for he has prayed with much faith concerning thee that thou mightest be brought to the knowledge of the truth; therefore, for this purpose have I come to convince thee of the power and authority of God, that the prayers of his servants might be answered according to their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.15'>And now behold, can ye dispute the power of God? For behold, doth not my voice shake the earth? And can ye not also behold me before you? And I am sent from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.16'>Now I say unto thee: Go, and remember the captivity of thy fathers in the land of Helam, and in the land of Nephi; and remember how great things he has done for them; for they were in bondage, and he has delivered them. And now I say unto thee, Alma, go thy way, and seek to destroy the church no more, that their prayers may be answered, and this even if thou wilt of thyself be cast off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.17'>And now it came to pass that these were the last words which the angel spake unto Alma, and he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.18'>And now Alma and those that were with him fell again to the earth, for great was their astonishment; for with their own eyes they had beheld an angel of the Lord; and his voice was as thunder, which shook the earth; and they knew that there was nothing save the power of God that could shake the earth and cause it to tremble as though it would part asunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.19'>And now the astonishment of Alma was so great that he became dumb, that he could not open his mouth; yea, and he became weak, even that he could not move his hands; therefore he was taken by those that were with him, and carried helpless, even until he was laid before his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.20'>And they rehearsed unto his father all that had happened unto them; and his father rejoiced, for he knew that it was the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.21'>And he caused that a multitude should be gathered together that they might witness what the Lord had done for his son, and also for those that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.22'>And he caused that the priests should assemble themselves together; and they began to fast, and to pray to the Lord their God that he would open the mouth of Alma, that he might speak, and also that his limbs might receive their strength-that the eyes of the people might be opened to see and know of the goodness and glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.23'>And it came to pass after they had fasted and prayed for the space of two days and two nights, the limbs of Alma received their strength, and he stood up and began to speak unto them, bidding them to be of good comfort:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.24'>For, said he, I have repented of my sins, and have been redeemed of the Lord; behold I am born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.25'>And the Lord said unto me: Marvel not that all mankind, yea, men and women, all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, must be born again; yea, born of God, changed from their carnal and fallen state, to a state of righteousness, being redeemed of God, becoming his sons and daughters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.26'>And thus they become new creatures; and unless they do this, they can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.27'>I say unto you, unless this be the case, they must be cast off; and this I know, because I was like to be cast off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.28'>Nevertheless, after wading through much tribulation, repenting nigh unto death, the Lord in mercy hath seen fit to snatch me out of an everlasting burning, and I am born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.29'>My soul hath been redeemed from the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity. I was in the darkest abyss; but now I behold the marvelous light of God. My soul was racked with eternal torment; but I am snatched, and my soul is pained no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.30'>I rejected my Redeemer, and denied that which had been spoken of by our fathers; but now that they may foresee that he will come, and that he remembereth every creature of his creating, he will make himself manifest unto all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.31'>Yea, every knee shall bow, and every tongue confess before him. Yea, even at the last day, when all men shall stand to be judged of him, then shall they confess that he is God; then shall they confess, who live without God in the world, that the judgment of an everlasting punishment is just upon them; and they shall quake, and tremble, and shrink beneath the glance of his all-searching eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.32'>And now it came to pass that Alma began from this time forward to teach the people, and those who were with Alma at the time the angel appeared unto them, traveling round about through all the land, publishing to all the people the things which they had heard and seen, and preaching the word of God in much tribulation, being greatly persecuted by those who were unbelievers, being smitten by many of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.33'>But notwithstanding all this, they did impart much consolation to the church, confirming their faith, and exhorting them with long-suffering and much travail to keep the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.34'>And four of them were the sons of Mosiah; and their names were Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and Himni; these were the names of the sons of Mosiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.35'>And they traveled throughout all the land of Zarahemla, and among all the people who were under the reign of king Mosiah, zealously striving to repair all the injuries which they had done to the church, confessing all their sins, and publishing all the things which they had seen, and explaining the prophecies and the scriptures to all who desired to hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.36'>And thus they were instruments in the hands of God in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth, yea, to the knowledge of their Redeemer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.27.37'>And how blessed are they! For they did publish peace; they did publish good tidings of good; and they did declare unto the people that the Lord reigneth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.28'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.1'>NOW it came to pass that after the sons of Mosiah had done all these things, *they took a small number with them and returned to their father, the king, and desired of him that he would grant unto them that they might, with these whom they had selected, go up to the land of Nephi that they might preach the things which they had heard, and that they might impart the word of God to their brethren, the Lamanites-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.2'>That perhaps they might bring them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and convince them of the iniquity of their fathers; and that perhaps they might cure them of their hatred towards the Nephites, that they might also be brought to rejoice in the Lord their God, that they might become friendly to one another, and that there should be no more contentions in all the land which the Lord their God had given them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.3'>Now they were desirous that salvation should be declared to every creature, for they could not bear that any human soul should perish; yea, even the very thoughts that any soul should endure endless torment did cause them to quake and tremble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.4'>And thus did the Spirit of the Lord work upon them, for they were the very vilest of sinners. And the Lord saw fit in his infinite mercy to spare them; nevertheless they suffered much anguish of soul because of their iniquities, suffering much and fearing that they should be cast off forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.5'>And it came to pass that they did plead with their father many days that they might go up to the land of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.6'>And king Mosiah went and inquired of the Lord if he should let his sons go up among the Lamanites to preach the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.7'>And the Lord said unto Mosiah: Let them go up, for many shall believe on their words, and they shall have eternal life; and I will deliver thy sons out of the hands of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.8'>And it came to pass that Mosiah granted that they might go and do according to their request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.9'>And they took their journey into the wilderness to go up to preach the word among the Lamanites; and I shall give an account of their proceedings hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.10'>Now king Mosiah had no one to confer the kingdom upon, for there was not any of his sons who would accept of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.11'>Therefore he took the records which were engraven on the plates of brass, and also the plates of Nephi, and all the things which he had kept and preserved according to the commandments of God, after having translated and caused to be written the records which were on the plates of gold which had been found by the people of Limhi, which were delivered to him by the hand of Limhi;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.12'>And this he did because of the great anxiety of his people; for they were desirous beyond measure to know concerning those people who had been destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.13'>And now he translated them by the means of those two stones which were fastened into the two rims of a bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.14'>Now these things were prepared from the beginning, and were handed down from generation to generation, for the purpose of interpreting languages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.15'>And they have been kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord, that he should discover to every creature who should possess the land the iniquities and abominations of his people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.16'>And whosoever has these things is called seer, after the manner of old times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.17'>Now after Mosiah had finished translating these records, behold, it gave an account of the people who were destroyed, from the time that they were destroyed back to the building of the great tower, at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people and they were scattered abroad upon the face of all the earth, yea, and even from that time back until the creation of Adam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.18'>Now this account did cause the people of Mosiah to mourn exceedingly, yea, they were filled with sorrow; nevertheless it gave them much knowledge, in the which they did rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.19'>And this account shall be written hereafter; for behold, it is expedient that all people should know the things which are written in this account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.28.20'>And now, as I said unto you, that after king Mosiah had done these things, he took the plates of brass, and all the things which he had kept, and conferred them upon Alma, who was the son of Alma; yea, all the records, and also the interpreters, and conferred them upon him, and commanded him that he should keep and preserve them, and also keep a record of the people, handing them down from one generation to another, even as they had been handed down from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.29'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.1'>NOW when Mosiah had done this he sent out throughout all the land, among all the people, desiring to know their will concerning who should be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.2'>And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: We are desirous that Aaron thy son should be our king and our ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.3'>Now Aaron had gone up to the land of Nephi, therefore the king could not confer the kingdom upon him; neither would Aaron take upon him the kingdom; neither were any of the sons of Mosiah willing to take upon them the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.4'>Therefore king Mosiah sent again among the people; yea, even a written word sent he among the people. And these were the words that were written, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.5'>Behold, O ye my people, or my brethren, for I esteem you as such, I desire that ye should consider the cause which ye are called to consider-for ye are desirous to have a king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.6'>Now I declare unto you that he to whom the kingdom doth rightly belong has declined, and will not take upon him the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.7'>And now if there should be another appointed in his stead, behold I fear there would rise contentions among you. And who knoweth but what my son, to whom the kingdom doth belong, should turn to be angry and draw away a part of this people after him, which would cause wars and contentions among you, which would be the cause of shedding much blood and perverting the way of the Lord, yea, and destroy the souls of many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.8'>Now I say unto you let us be wise and consider these things, for we have no right to destroy my son, neither should we have any right to destroy another if he should be appointed in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.9'>And if my son should turn again to his pride and vain things he would recall the things which he had said, and claim his right to the kingdom, which would cause him and also this people to commit much sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.10'>And now let us be wise and look forward to these things, and do that which will make for the peace of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.11'>Therefore I will be your king the remainder of my days; nevertheless, let us appoint judges, to judge this people according to our law; and we will newly arrange the affairs of this people, for we will appoint wise men to be judges, that will judge this people according to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.12'>Now it is better that a man should be judged of God than of man, for the judgments of God are always just, but the judgments of man are not always just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.13'>Therefore, if it were possible that you could have just men to be your kings, who would establish the laws of God, and judge this people according to his commandments, yea, if ye could have men for your kings who would do even as my father Benjamin did for this people-I say unto you, if this could always be the case then it would be expedient that ye should always have kings to rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.14'>And even I myself have labored with all the power and faculties which I have possessed, to teach you the commandments of God, and to establish peace throughout the land, that there should be no wars nor contentions, no stealing, nor plundering, nor murdering, nor any manner of iniquity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.15'>And whosoever has committed iniquity, him have I punished according to the crime which he has committed, according to the law which has been given to us by our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.16'>Now I say unto you, that because all men are not just it is not expedient that ye should have a king or kings to rule over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.17'>For behold, how much iniquity doth one wicked king cause to be committed, yea, and what great destruction!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.18'>Yea, remember king Noah, his wickedness and his abominations, and also the wickedness and abominations of his people. Behold what great destruction did come upon them; and also because of their iniquities they were brought into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.19'>And were it not for the interposition of their all-wise Creator, and this because of their sincere repentance, they must unavoidably remain in bondage until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.20'>But behold, he did deliver them because they did humble themselves before him; and because they cried mightily unto him he did deliver them out of bondage; and thus doth the Lord work with his power in all cases among the children of men, extending the arm of mercy towards them that put their trust in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.21'>And behold, now I say unto you, ye cannot dethrone an iniquitous king save it be through much contention, and the shedding of much blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.22'>For behold, he has his friends in iniquity, and he keepeth his guards about him; and he teareth up the laws of those who have reigned in righteousness before him; and he trampleth under his feet the commandments of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.23'>And he enacteth laws, and sendeth them forth among his people, yea, laws after the manner of his own wickedness; and whosoever doth not obey his laws he causeth to be destroyed; and whosoever doth rebel against him he will send his armies against them to war, and if he can he will destroy them; and thus an unrighteous king doth pervert the ways of all righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.24'>And now behold I say unto you, it is not expedient that such abominations should come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.25'>Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers, which are correct, and which were given them by the hand of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.26'>Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law-to do your business by the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.27'>And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.28'>And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.29'>If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.30'>And I command you to do these things in the fear of the Lord; and I command you to do these things, and that ye have no king; that if these people commit sins and iniquities they shall be answered upon their own heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.31'>For behold I say unto you, the sins of many people have been caused by the iniquities of their kings; therefore their iniquities are answered upon the heads of their kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.32'>And now I desire that this inequality should be no more in this land, especially among this my people; but I desire that this land be a land of liberty, and every man may enjoy his rights and privileges alike, so long as the Lord sees fit that we may live and inherit the land, yea, even as long as any of our posterity remains upon the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.33'>And many more things did king Mosiah write unto them, unfolding unto them all the trials and troubles of a righteous king, yea, all the travails of soul for their people, and also all the murmurings of the people to their king; and he explained it all unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.34'>And he told them that these things ought not to be; but that the burden should come upon all the people, that every man might bear his part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.35'>And he also unfolded unto them all the disadvantages they labored under, by having an unrighteous king to rule over them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.36'>Yea, all his iniquities and abominations, and all the wars, and contentions, and bloodshed, and the stealing, and the plundering, and the committing of whoredoms, and all manner of iniquities which cannot be enumerated-telling them that these things ought not to be, that they were expressly repugnant to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.37'>And now it came to pass, after king Mosiah had sent these things forth among the people they were convinced of the truth of his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.38'>Therefore they relinquished their desires for a king, and became exceedingly anxious that every man should have an equal chance throughout all the land; yea, and every man expressed a willingness to answer for his own sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.39'>Therefore, it came to pass that they assembled themselves together in bodies throughout the land, to cast in their voices concerning who should be their judges, to judge them according to the law which had been given them; and they were exceedingly rejoiced because of the liberty which had been granted unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.40'>And they did wax strong in love towards Mosiah; yea, they did esteem him more than any other man; for they did not look upon him as a tyrant who was seeking for gain, yea, for that lucre which doth corrupt the soul; for he had not exacted riches of them, neither had he delighted in the shedding of blood; but he had established peace in the land, and he had granted unto his people that they should be delivered from all manner of bondage; therefore they did esteem him, yea, exceedingly, beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.41'>And it came to pass that they did appoint judges to rule over them, or to judge them according to the law; and this they did throughout all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.42'>And it came to pass that Alma was appointed to be the first chief judge, he being also the high priest, his father having conferred the office upon him, and having given him the charge concerning all the affairs of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.43'>And now it came to pass that Alma did walk in the ways of the Lord, and he did keep his commandments, and he did judge righteous judgments; and there was continual peace through the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.44'>And thus *commenced the reign of the judges throughout all the land of Zarahemla, among all the people who were called the Nephites; and Alma was the first and chief judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.29.45'>And now it came to pass that his father died, being eighty and two years old, having lived to fulfil the commandments of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>NOW it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, from this time forward, king Mosiah having gone the way of all the earth, having warred a good warfare, walking uprightly before God, leaving none to reign in his stead; nevertheless he had established laws, and they were acknowledged by the people; therefore they were obliged to abide by the laws which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And it came to pass that in the first year of the reign of Alma in the judgment-seat, there was a man brought before him to be judged, a man who was large, and was noted for his much strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And he had gone about among the people, preaching to them that which he termed to be the word of God, bearing down against the church; declaring unto the people that every priest and teacher ought to become popular; and they ought not to labor with their hands, but that they ought to be supported by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And he also testified unto the people that all mankind should be saved at the last day, and that they need not fear nor tremble, but that they might lift up their heads and rejoice; for the Lord had created all men, and had also redeemed all men; and, in the end, all men should have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>And it came to pass that he did teach these things so much that many did believe on his words, even so many that they began to support him and give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And he began to be lifted up in the pride of his heart, and to wear very costly apparel, yea, and even began to establish a church after the manner of his preaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And it came to pass as he was going, to preach to those who believed on his word, he met a man who belonged to the church of God, yea, even one of their teachers; and he began to contend with him sharply, that he might lead away the people of the church; but the man withstood him, admonishing him with the words of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>Now the name of the man was Gideon; and it was he who was an instrument in the hands of God in delivering the people of Limhi out of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>Now, because Gideon withstood him with the words of God he was wroth with Gideon, and drew his sword and began to smite him. Now Gideon being stricken with many years, therefore he was not able to withstand his blows, therefore he was slain by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And the man who slew him was taken by the people of the church, and was brought before Alma, to be judged according to the crimes which he had committed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And it came to pass that he stood before Alma and pleaded for himself with much boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>But Alma said unto him: Behold, this is the first time that priestcraft has been introduced among this people. And behold, thou art not only guilty of priestcraft, but hast endeavored to enforce it by the sword; and were priestcraft to be enforced among this people it would prove their entire destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>And thou hast shed the blood of a righteous man, yea, a man who has done much good among this people; and were we to spare thee his blood would come upon us for vengeance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>Therefore thou art condemned to die, according to the law which has been given us by Mosiah, our last king; and it has been acknowledged by this people; therefore this people must abide by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And it came to pass that they took him; and his name was Nehor; and they carried him upon the top of the hill Manti, and there he was caused, or rather did acknowledge, between the heavens and the earth, that what he had taught to the people was contrary to the word of God; and there he suffered an ignominious death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Nevertheless, this did not put an end to the spreading of priestcraft through the land; for there were many who loved the vain things of the world, and they went forth preaching false doctrines; and this they did for the sake of riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Nevertheless, they durst not lie, if it were known, for fear of the law, for liars were punished; therefore they pretended to preach according to their belief; and now the law could have no power on any man for his belief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And they durst not steal, for fear of the law, for such were punished; neither durst they rob, nor murder, for he that murdered was punished unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>But it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church of God began to persecute those that did belong to the church of God, and had taken upon them the name of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>Yea, they did persecute them, and afflict them with all manner of words, and this because of their humility; because they were not proud in their own eyes, and because they did impart the word of God, one with another, without money and without price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>Now there was a strict law among the people of the church, that there should not any man, belonging to the church, arise and persecute those that did not belong to the church, and that there should be no persecution among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>Nevertheless, there were many among them who began to be proud, and began to contend warmly with their adversaries, even unto blows; yea, they would smite one another with their fists.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>Now this was in the *second year of the reign of Alma, and it was a cause of much affliction to the church; yea, it was the cause of much trial with the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>For the hearts of many were hardened, and their names were blotted out, that they were remembered no more among the people of God. And also many withdrew themselves from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>Now this was a great trial to those that did stand fast in the faith; nevertheless, they were steadfast and immovable in keeping the commandments of God, and they bore with patience the persecution which was heaped upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And when the priests left their labor to impart the word of God unto the people, the people also left their labors to hear the word of God. And when the priest had imparted unto them the word of God they all returned again diligently unto their labors; and the priest, not esteeming himself above his hearers, for the preacher was no better than the hearer, neither was the teacher any better than the learner; and thus they were all equal, and they did all labor, every man according to his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>And they did impart of their substance, every man according to that which he had, to the poor, and the needy, and the sick, and the afflicted; and they did not wear costly apparel, yet they were neat and comely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>And thus they did establish the affairs of the church; and thus they began to have continual peace again, notwithstanding all their persecutions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.29'>And now, because of the steadiness of the church they began to be exceedingly rich, having abundance of all things whatsoever they stood in need-an abundance of flocks and herds, and fatlings of every kind, and also abundance of grain, and of gold, and of silver, and of precious things, and abundance of silk and fine-twined linen, and all manner of good homely cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.30'>And thus, in their prosperous circumstances, they did not send away any who were naked, or that were hungry, or that were athirst, or that were sick, or that had not been nourished; and they did not set their hearts upon riches; therefore they were liberal to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, whether out of the church or in the church, having no respect to persons as to those who stood in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.31'>And thus they did prosper and become far more wealthy than those who did not belong to their church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.32'>For those who did not belong to their church did indulge themselves in sorceries, and in idolatry or idleness, and in babblings, and in envyings and strife; wearing costly apparel; being lifted up in the pride of their own eyes; persecuting, lying, thieving, robbing, committing whoredoms, and murdering, and all manner of wickedness; nevertheless, the law was put in force upon all those who did transgress it, inasmuch as it was possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.33'>And it came to pass that by thus exercising the law upon them, every man suffering according to that which he had done, they became more still, and durst not commit any wickedness if it were known; therefore, there was much peace among the people of Nephi until the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>AND it came to pass in the commencement of the *fifth year of their reign there began to be a contention among the people; for a certain man, being called Amlici, he being a very cunning man, yea, a wise man as to the wisdom of the world, he being after the order of the man that slew Gideon by the sword, who was executed according to the law-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>Now this Amlici had, by his cunning, drawn away much people after him; even so much that they began to be very powerful; and they began to endeavor to establish Amlici to be a king over the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Now this was alarming to the people of the church, and also to all those who had not been drawn away after the persuasions of Amlici; for they knew that according to their law that such things must be established by the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>Therefore, if it were possible that Amlici should gain the voice of the people, he, being a wicked man, would deprive them of their rights and privileges of the church; for it was his intent to destroy the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>And it came to pass that the people assembled themselves together throughout all the land, every man according to his mind, whether it were for or against Amlici, in separate bodies, having much dispute and wonderful contentions one with another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>And thus they did assemble themselves together to cast in their voices concerning the matter; and they were laid before the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>And it came to pass that the voice of the people came against Amlici, that he was not made king over the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>Now this did cause much joy in the hearts of those who were against him; but Amlici did stir up those who were in his favor to anger against those who were not in his favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>And it came to pass that they gathered themselves together, and did consecrate Amlici to be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>Now when Amlici was made king over them he commanded them that they should take up arms against their brethren; and this he did that he might subject them to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>Now the people of Amlici were distinguished by the name of Amlici, being called Amlicites; and the remainder were called Nephites, or the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Therefore the people of the Nephites were aware of the intent of the Amlicites, and therefore they did prepare to meet them; yea, they did arm themselves with swords, and with cimeters, and with bows, and with arrows, and with stones, and with slings, and with all manner of weapons of war, of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And thus they were prepared to meet the Amlicites at the time of their coming. And there were appointed captains, and higher captains, and chief captains, according to their numbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>And it came to pass that Amlici did arm his men with all manner of weapons of war of every kind; and he also appointed rulers and leaders over his people, to lead them to war against their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>And it came to pass that the Amlicites came upon the hill Amnihu, which was east of the river Sidon, which ran by the land of Zarahemla, and there they began to make war with the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>Now Alma, being the chief judge and the governor of the people of Nephi, therefore he went up with his people, yea, with his captains, and chief captains, yea, at the head of his armies, against the Amlicites to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>And they began to slay the Amlicites upon the hill east of Sidon. And the Amlicites did contend with the Nephites with great strength, insomuch that many of the Nephites did fall before the Amlicites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>Nevertheless the Lord did strengthen the hand of the Nephites, that they slew the Amlicites with great slaughter, that they began to flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>And it came to pass that the Nephites did pursue the Amlicites all that day, and did slay them with much slaughter, insomuch that there were slain of the Amlicites twelve thousand five hundred thirty and two souls; and there were slain of the Nephites six thousand five hundred sixty and two souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And it came to pass that when Alma could pursue the Amlicites no longer he caused that his people should pitch their tents in the valley of Gideon, the valley being called after that Gideon who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword; and in this valley the Nephites did pitch their tents for the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And Alma sent spies to follow the remnant of the Amlicites, that he might know of their plans and their plots, whereby he might guard himself against them, that he might preserve his people from being destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now those whom he had sent out to watch the camp of the Amlicites were called Zeram, and Amnor, and Manti, and Limher; these were they who went out with their men to watch the camp of the Amlicites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And it came to pass that on the morrow they returned into the camp of the Nephites in great haste, being greatly astonished, and struck with much fear, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>Behold, we followed the camp of the Amlicites, and to our great astonishment, in the land of Minon, above the land of Zarahemla, in the course of the land of Nephi, we saw a numerous host of the Lamanites; and behold, the Amlicites have joined them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>And they are upon our brethren in that land; and they are fleeing before them with their flocks, and their wives, and their children, towards our city; and except we make haste they obtain possession of our city, and our fathers, and our wives, and our children be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And it came to pass that the people of Nephi took their tents, and departed out of the valley of Gideon towards their city, which was the city of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And behold, as they were crossing the river Sidon, the Lamanites and the Amlicites, being as numerous almost, as it were, as the sands of the sea, came upon them to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>Nevertheless, the Nephites being strengthened by the hand of the Lord, having prayed mightily to him that he would deliver them out of the hands of their enemies, therefore the Lord did hear their cries, and did strengthen them, and the Lamanites and the Amlicites did fall before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>And it came to pass that Alma fought with Amlici with the sword, face to face; and they did contend mightily, one with another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>And it came to pass that Alma, being a man of God, being exercised with much faith, cried, saying: O Lord, have mercy and spare my life, that I may be an instrument in thy hands to save and preserve this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Now when Alma had said these words he contended again with Amlici; and he was strengthened, insomuch that he slew Amlici with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And he also contended with the king of the Lamanites; but the king of the Lamanites fled back from before Alma and sent his guards to contend with Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>But Alma, with his guards, contended with the guards of the king of the Lamanites until he slew and drove them back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And thus he cleared the ground, or rather the bank, which was on the west of the river Sidon, throwing the bodies of the Lamanites who had been slain into the waters of Sidon, that thereby his people might have room to cross and contend with the Lamanites and the Amlicites on the west side of the river Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And it came to pass that when they had all crossed the river Sidon that the Lamanites and the Amlicites began to flee before them, notwithstanding they were so numerous that they could not be numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And they fled before the Nephites towards the wilderness which was west and north, away beyond the borders of the land; and the Nephites did pursue them with their might, and did slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.37'>Yea, they were met on every hand, and slain and driven, until they were scattered on the west, and on the north, until they had reached the wilderness, which was called Hermounts; and it was that part of the wilderness which was infested by wild and ravenous beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.38'>And it came to pass that many died in the wilderness of their wounds, and were devoured by those beasts and also the vultures of the air; and their bones have been found, and have been heaped up on the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>AND it came to pass that the Nephites who were not slain by the weapons of war, after having buried those who had been slain-now the number of the slain were not numbered, because of the greatness of their number-after they had finished burying their dead they all returned to their lands, and to their houses, and their wives, and their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>Now many women and children had been slain with the sword, and also many of their flocks and their herds; and also many of their fields of grain were destroyed, for they were trodden down by the hosts of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>And now as many of the Lamanites and the Amlicites who had been slain upon the bank of the river Sidon were cast into the waters of Sidon; and behold their bones are in the depths of the sea, and they are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>And the Amlicites were distinguished from the Nephites, for they had marked themselves with red in their foreheads after the manner of the Lamanites; nevertheless they had not shorn their heads like unto the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>Now the heads of the Lamanites were shorn; and they were naked, save it were skin which was girded about their loins, and also their armor, which was girded about them, and their bows, and their arrows, and their stones, and their slings, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the skins of the Lamanites were dark, according to the mark which was set upon their fathers, which was a curse upon them because of their transgression and their rebellion against their brethren, who consisted of Nephi, Jacob, and Joseph, and Sam, who were just and holy men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>And their brethren sought to destroy them, therefore they were cursed; and the Lord God set a mark upon them, yea, upon Laman and Lemuel, and also the sons of Ishmael, and Ishmaelitish women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And this was done that their seed might be distinguished from the seed of their brethren, that thereby the Lord God might preserve his people, that they might not mix and believe in incorrect traditions which would prove their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>And it came to pass that whosoever did mingle his seed with that of the Lamanites did bring the same curse upon his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>Therefore, whosoever suffered himself to be led away by the Lamanites was called under that head, and there was a mark set upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And it came to pass that whosoever would not believe in the tradition of the Lamanites, but believed those records which were brought out of the land of Jerusalem, and also in the tradition of their fathers, which were correct, who believed in the commandments of God and kept them, were called the Nephites, or the people of Nephi, from that time forth-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>And it is they who have kept the records which are true of their people, and also of the people of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>Now we will return again to the Amlicites, for they also had a mark set upon them; yea, they set the mark upon themselves, yea, even a mark of red upon their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>Thus the word of God is fulfilled, for these are the words which he said to Nephi: Behold, the Lamanites have I cursed, and I will set a mark on them that they and their seed may be separated from thee and thy seed, from this time henceforth and forever, except they repent of their wickedness and turn to me that I may have mercy upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And again: I will set a mark upon him that mingleth his seed with thy brethren, that they may be cursed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>And again: I will set a mark upon him that fighteth against thee and thy seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And again, I say he that departeth from thee shall no more be called thy seed; and I will bless thee, and whomsoever shall be called thy seed, henceforth and forever; and these were the promises of the Lord unto Nephi and to his seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>Now the Amlicites knew not that they were fulfilling the words of God when they began to mark themselves in their foreheads; nevertheless they had come out in open rebellion against God; therefore it was expedient that the curse should fall upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>Now I would that ye should see that they brought upon themselves the curse; and even so doth every man that is cursed bring upon himself his own condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>Now it came to pass that not many days after the battle which was fought in the land of Zarahemla, by the Lamanites and the Amlicites, that there was another army of the Lamanites came in upon the people of Nephi, in the same place where the first army met the Amlicites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And it came to pass that there was an army sent to drive them out of their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.22'>Now Alma himself being afflicted with a wound did not go up to battle at this time against the Lamanites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.23'>But he sent up a numerous army against them; and they went up and slew many of the Lamanites, and drove the remainder of them out of the borders of their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.24'>And then they returned again and began to establish peace in the land, being troubled no more for a time with their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.25'>Now all these things were done, yea, all these wars and contentions were commenced and ended in the *fifth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.26'>And in one year were thousands and tens of thousands of souls sent to the eternal world, that they might reap their rewards according to their works, whether they were good or whether they were bad, to reap eternal happiness or eternal misery, according to the spirit which they listed to obey, whether it be a good spirit or a bad one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.27'>For every man receiveth wages of him whom he listeth to obey, and this according to the words of the spirit of prophecy; therefore let it be according to the truth. And thus endeth the fifth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>NOW it came to pass in the *sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, there were no contentions nor wars in the land of Zarahemla;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>But the people were afflicted, yea, greatly afflicted for the loss of their brethren, and also for the loss of their flocks and herds, and also for the loss of their fields of grain, which were trodden under foot and destroyed by the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And so great were their afflictions that every soul had cause to mourn; and they believed that it was the judgments of God sent upon them because of their wickedness and their abominations; therefore they were awakened to a remembrance of their duty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>And they began to establish the church more fully; yea, and many were baptized in the waters of Sidon and were joined to the church of God; yea, they were baptized by the hand of Alma, who had been consecrated the high priest over the people of the church, by the hand of his father Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And it came to pass in the *seventh year of the reign of the judges there were about three thousand five hundred souls that united themselves to the church of God and were baptized. And thus ended the seventh year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; and there was continual peace in all that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And it came to pass in the *eighth year of the reign of the judges, that the people of the church began to wax proud, because of their exceeding riches, and their fine silks, and their fine-twined linen, and because of their many flocks and herds, and their gold and their silver, and all manner of precious things, which they had obtained by their industry; and in all these things were they lifted up in the pride of their eyes, for they began to wear very costly apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>Now this was the cause of much affliction to Alma, yea, and to many of the people whom Alma had consecrated to be teachers, and priests, and elders over the church; yea, many of them were sorely grieved for the wickedness which they saw had begun to be among their people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>For they saw and beheld with great sorrow that the people of the church began to be lifted up in the pride of their eyes, and to set their hearts upon riches and upon the vain things of the world, that they began to be scornful, one towards another, and they began to persecute those that did not believe according to their own will and pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>And thus, in this eighth year of the reign of the judges, there began to be great contentions among the people of the church; yea, there were envyings, and strife, and malice, and persecutions, and pride, even to exceed the pride of those who did not belong to the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And thus ended the eighth year of the reign of the judges; and the wickedness of the church was a great stumbling-block to those who did not belong to the church; and thus the church began to fail in its progress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And it came to pass in the *commencement of the ninth year, Alma saw the wickedness of the church, and he saw also that the example of the church began to lead those who were unbelievers on from one piece of iniquity to another, thus bringing on the destruction of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>Yea, he saw great inequality among the people, some lifting themselves up with their pride, despising others, turning their backs upon the needy and the naked and those who were hungry, and those who were athirst, and those who were sick and afflicted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>Now this was a great cause for lamentations among the people, while others were abasing themselves, succoring those who stood in need of their succor, such as imparting their substance to the poor and the needy, feeding the hungry, and suffering all manner of afflictions, for Christ's sake, who should come according to the spirit of prophecy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>Looking forward to that day, thus retaining a remission of their sins; being filled with great joy because of the resurrection of the dead, according to the will and power and deliverance of Jesus Christ from the bands of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>And now it came to pass that Alma, having seen the afflictions of the humble followers of God, and the persecutions which were heaped upon them by the remainder of his people, and seeing all their inequality, began to be very sorrowful; nevertheless the Spirit of the Lord did not fail him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And he selected a wise man who was among the elders of the church, and gave him power according to the voice of the people, that he might have power to enact laws according to the laws which had been given, and to put them in force according to the wickedness and the crimes of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>Now this man's name was Nephihah, and he was appointed chief judge; and he sat in the judgment-seat to judge and to govern the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>Now Alma did not grant unto him the office of being high priest over the church, but he retained the office of high priest unto himself; but he delivered the judgment-seat unto Nephihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And this he did that he himself might go forth among his people, or among the people of Nephi, that he might preach the word of God unto them, to stir them up in remembrance of their duty, and that he might pull down, by the word of God, all the pride and craftiness and all the contentions which were among his people, seeing no way that he might reclaim them save it were in bearing down in pure testimony against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And thus in the commencement of the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Alma delivered up the judgment-seat to Nephihah, and confined himself wholly to the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to the testimony of the word, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>NOW it came to pass that *Alma began to deliver the word of God unto the people, first in the land of Zarahemla, and from thence throughout all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>And these are the words which he spake to the people in the church which was established in the city of Zarahemla, according to his own record, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>I, Alma, having been consecrated by my father, Alma, to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, behold, I say unto you that he began to establish a church in the land which was in the borders of Nephi; yea, the land which was called the land of Mormon; yea, and he did baptize his brethren in the waters of Mormon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And behold, I say unto you, they were delivered out of the hands of the people of king Noah, by the mercy and power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>And behold, after that, they were brought into bondage by the hands of the Lamanites in the wilderness; yea, I say unto you, they were in captivity, and again the Lord did deliver them out of bondage by the power of his word; and we were brought into this land, and here we began to establish the church of God throughout this land also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, you that belong to this church, have you sufficiently retained in remembrance the captivity of your fathers? Yea, and have you sufficiently retained in remembrance his mercy and long-suffering towards them? And moreover, have ye sufficiently retained in remembrance that he has delivered their souls from hell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>Behold, he changed their hearts; yea, he awakened them out of a deep sleep, and they awoke unto God. Behold, they were in the midst of darkness; nevertheless, their souls were illuminated by the light of the everlasting word; yea, they were encircled about by the bands of death, and the chains of hell, and an everlasting destruction did await them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>And now I ask of you, my brethren, were they destroyed? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, they were not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.9'>And again I ask, were the bands of death broken, and the chains of hell which encircled them about, were they loosed? I say unto you, Yea, they were loosed, and their souls did expand, and they did sing redeeming love. And I say unto you that they are saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.10'>And now I ask of you on what conditions are they saved? Yea, what grounds had they to hope for salvation? What is the cause of their being loosed from the bands of death, yea, and also the chains of hell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.11'>Behold, I can tell you-did not my father Alma believe in the words which were delivered by the mouth of Abinadi? And was he not a holy prophet? Did he not speak the words of God, and my father Alma believe them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.12'>And according to his faith there was a mighty change wrought in his heart. Behold I say unto you that this is all true.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.26'>And now behold, I say unto you, my brethren, if ye have experienced a change of heart, and if ye have felt to sing the song of redeeming love, I would ask, can ye feel so now?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.60'>And now I say unto you that the good shepherd doth call after you; and if you will hearken unto his voice he will bring you into his fold, and ye are his sheep; and he commandeth you that ye suffer no ravenous wolf to enter among you, that ye may not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.61'>And now I, Alma, do command you in the language of him who hath commanded me, that ye observe to do the words which I have spoken unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.62'>I speak by way of command unto you that belong to the church; and unto those who do not belong to the church I speak by way of invitation, saying: Come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye also may be partakers of the fruit of the tree of life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.1'>AND now it came to pass that after Alma had made an end of speaking unto the people of the church, which was established in the city of Zarahemla, he ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands according to the order of God, to preside and watch over the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.2'>And it came to pass that whosoever did not belong to the church who repented of their sins were baptized unto repentance, and were received into the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.3'>And it also came to pass that whosoever did belong to the church that did not repent of their wickedness and humble themselves before God-I mean those who were lifted up in the pride of their hearts-the same were rejected, and their names were blotted out, that their names were not numbered among those of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.4'>And thus they began to establish the order of the church in the city of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.5'>Now I would that ye should understand that the word of God was liberal unto all, that none were deprived of the privilege of assembling themselves together to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.6'>Nevertheless the children of God were commanded that they should gather themselves together oft, and join in fasting and mighty prayer in behalf of the welfare of the souls of those who knew not God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.7'>And now it came to pass that when Alma had made these regulations he departed from them, yea, from the church which was in the city of Zarahemla, and went over upon the east of the river Sidon, into the valley of Gideon, there having been a city built, which was called the city of Gideon, which was in the valley that was called Gideon, being called after the man who was slain by the hand of Nehor with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.8'>And Alma went and began to declare the word of God unto the church which was established in the valley of Gideon, according to the revelation of the truth of the word which had been spoken by his fathers, and according to the spirit of prophecy which was in him, according to the testimony of Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who should come to redeem his people from their sins, and the holy order by which he was called. And thus it is written. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.1'>BEHOLD my beloved brethren, seeing that I have been permitted to come unto you, therefore I attempt to address you in my language; yea, by my own mouth, seeing that it is the first time that I have spoken unto you by the words of my mouth, I having been wholly confined to the judgment-seat, having had much business that I could not come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.2'>And even I could not have come now at this time were it not that the judgment-seat hath been given to another, to reign in my stead; and the Lord in much mercy hath granted that I should come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.3'>And behold, I have come having great hopes and much desire that I should find that ye had humbled yourselves before God, and that ye had continued in the supplicating of his grace, that I should find that ye were blameless before him, that I should find that ye were not in the awful dilemma that our brethren were in at Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.4'>But blessed be the name of God, that he hath given me to know, yea, hath given unto me the exceedingly great joy of knowing that they are established again in the way of his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.5'>And I trust, according to the Spirit of God which is in me, that I shall also have joy over you; nevertheless I do not desire that my joy over you should come by the cause of so much afflictions and sorrow which I have had for the brethren at Zarahemla, for behold, my joy cometh over them after wading through much affliction and sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.6'>But behold, I trust that ye are not in a state of so much unbelief as were your brethren; I trust that ye are not lifted up in the pride of your hearts; yea, I trust that ye have not set your hearts upon riches and the vain things of the world; yea, I trust that you do not worship idols, but that ye do worship the true and the living God, and that ye look forward for the remission of your sins, with an everlasting faith, which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.7'>For behold, I say unto you there be many things to come; and behold, there is one thing which is of more importance than they all-for behold, the time is not far distant that the Redeemer liveth and cometh among his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.8'>Behold, I do not say that he will come among us at the time of his dwelling in his mortal tabernacle; for behold, the Spirit hath not said unto me that this should be the case. Now as to this thing I do not know; but this much I do know, that the Lord God hath power to do all things which are according to his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.9'>But behold, the Spirit hath said this much unto me, saying: Cry unto this people, saying-Repent ye, and prepare the way of the Lord, and walk in his paths, which are straight; for behold, the kingdom of heaven is at hand, and the Son of God cometh upon the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.10'>And behold, he shall be born of Mary, at Jerusalem which is the land of our forefathers, she being a virgin, a precious and chosen vessel, who shall be overshadowed and conceive by the power of the Holy Ghost, and bring forth a son, yea, even the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.11'>And he shall go forth, suffering pains and afflictions and temptations of every kind; and this that the word might be fulfilled which saith he will take upon him the pains and the sicknesses of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.12'>And he will take upon him death, that he may loose the bands of death which bind his people; and he will take upon him their infirmities, that his bowels may be filled with mercy, according to the flesh, that he may know according to the flesh how to succor his people according to their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.13'>Now the Spirit knoweth all things; nevertheless the Son of God suffereth according to the flesh that he might take upon him the sins of his people, that he might blot out their transgressions according to the power of his deliverance; and now behold, this is the testimony which is in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.14'>Now I say unto you that ye must repent, and be born again; for the Spirit saith if ye are not born again ye cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore come and be baptized unto repentance, that ye may be washed from your sins, that ye may have faith on the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sins of the world, who is mighty to save and to cleanse from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.15'>Yea, I say unto you come and fear not, and lay aside every sin, which easily doth beset you, which doth bind you down to destruction, yea, come and go forth, and show unto your God that ye are willing to repent of your sins and enter into a covenant with him to keep his commandments, and witness it unto him this day by going into the waters of baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.16'>And whosoever doeth this, and keepeth the commandments of God from thenceforth, the same will remember that I say unto him, yea, he will remember that I have said unto him, he shall have eternal life, according to the testimony of the Holy Spirit, which testifieth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.17'>And now my beloved brethren, do you believe these things? Behold, I say unto you, yea, I know that ye believe them; and the way that I know that ye believe them is by the manifestation of the Spirit which is in me. And now because your faith is strong concerning that, yea, concerning the things which I have spoken, great is my joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.18'>For as I said unto you from the beginning, that I had much desire that ye were not in the state of dilemma like your brethren, even so I have found that my desires have been gratified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.19'>For I perceive that ye are in the paths of righteousness; I perceive that ye are in the path which leads to the kingdom of God; yea, I perceive that ye are making his paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.20'>I perceive that it has been made known unto you, by the testimony of his word, that he cannot walk in crooked paths; neither doth he vary from that which he hath said; neither hath he a shadow of turning from the right to the left, or from that which is right to that which is wrong; therefore, his course is one eternal round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.21'>And he doth not dwell in unholy temples; neither can filthiness or anything which is unclean be received into the kingdom of God; therefore I say unto you the time shall come, yea, and it shall be at the last day, that he who is filthy shall remain in his filthiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.22'>And now my beloved brethren, I have said these things unto you that I might awaken you to a sense of your duty to God, that ye may walk blameless before him, that ye may walk after the holy order of God, after which ye have been received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.23'>And now I would that ye should be humble, and be submissive and gentle; easy to be entreated; full of patience and long-suffering; being temperate in all things; being diligent in keeping the commandments of God at all times; asking for whatsoever things ye stand in need, both spiritual and temporal; always returning thanks unto God for whatsoever things ye do receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.24'>And see that ye have faith, hope, and charity, and then ye will always abound in good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.25'>And may the Lord bless you, and keep your garments spotless, that ye may at last be brought to sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and the holy prophets who have been ever since the world began, having your garments spotless even as their garments are spotless, in the kingdom of heaven to go no more out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.26'>And now my beloved brethren, I have spoken these words unto you according to the Spirit which testifieth in me; and my soul doth exceedingly rejoice, because of the exceeding diligence and heed which ye have given unto my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.27'>And now, may the peace of God rest upon you, and upon your houses and lands, and upon your flocks and herds, and all that you possess, your women and your children, according to your faith and good works, from this time forth and forever. And thus I have spoken. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.1'>AND now it came to pass that Alma returned from the land of Gideon, after having taught the people of Gideon many things which cannot be written, having established the order of the church, according as he had before done in the land of Zarahemla, yea, he returned to his own house at Zarahemla to rest himself from the labors which he had performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.2'>And thus ended the ninth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.3'>And it came to pass in the commencement of the *tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma departed from thence and took his journey over into the land of Melek, on the west of the river Sidon, on the west by the borders of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.4'>And he began to teach the people in the land of Melek according to the holy order of God, by which he had been called; and he began to teach the people throughout all the land of Melek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.5'>And it came to pass that the people came to him throughout all the borders of the land which was by the wilderness side. And they were baptized throughout all the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.6'>So that when he had finished his work at Melek he departed thence, and traveled three days' journey on the north of the land of Melek; and he came to a city which was called Ammonihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.7'>Now it was the custom of the people of Nephi to call their lands, and their cities, and their villages, yea, even all their small villages, after the name of him who first possessed them; and thus it was with the land of Ammonihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.8'>And it came to pass that when Alma had come to the city of Ammonihah he began to preach the word of God unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.9'>Now Satan had gotten great hold upon the hearts of the people of the city of Ammonihah; therefore they would not hearken unto the words of Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.10'>Nevertheless Alma labored much in the spirit, wrestling with God in mighty prayer, that he would pour out his Spirit upon the people who were in the city; that he would also grant that he might baptize them unto repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.11'>Nevertheless, they hardened their hearts, saying unto him: Behold, we know that thou art Alma; and we know that thou art high priest over the church which thou hast established in many parts of the land, according to your tradition; and we are not of thy church, and we do not believe in such foolish traditions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.12'>And now we know that because we are not of thy church we know that thou hast no power over us; and thou hast delivered up the judgment-seat unto Nephihah; therefore thou art not the chief judge over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.13'>Now when the people had said this, and withstood all his words, and reviled him, and spit upon him, and caused that he should be cast out of their city, he departed thence and took his journey towards the city which was called Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.14'>And it came to pass that while he was journeying thither, being weighed down with sorrow, wading through much tribulation and anguish of soul, because of the wickedness of the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass while Alma was thus weighed down with sorrow, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.15'>Blessed art thou, Alma; therefore, lift up thy head and rejoice, for thou hast great cause to rejoice; for thou hast been faithful in keeping the commandments of God from the time which thou receivedst thy first message from him. Behold, I am he that delivered it unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.16'>And behold, I am sent to command thee that thou return to the city of Ammonihah, and preach again unto the people of the city; yea, preach unto them. Yea, say unto them, except they repent the Lord God will destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.17'>For behold, they do study at this time that they may destroy the liberty of thy people, (for thus saith the Lord) which is contrary to the statutes, and judgments, and commandments which he has given unto his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.18'>Now it came to pass that after Alma had received his message from the angel of the Lord he returned speedily to the land of Ammonihah. And he entered the city by another way, yea, by the way which is on the south of the city of Ammonihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.19'>And as he entered the city he was an hungered, and he said to a man: Will ye give to an humble servant of God something to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.20'>And the man said unto him: I am a Nephite, and I know that thou art a holy prophet of God, for thou art the man whom an angel said in a vision: Thou shalt receive. Therefore, go with me into my house and I will impart unto thee of my food; and I know that thou wilt be a blessing unto me and my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.21'>And it came to pass that the man received him into his house; and the man was called Amulek; and he brought forth bread and meat and set before Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.22'>And it came to pass that Alma ate bread and was filled; and he blessed Amulek and his house, and he gave thanks unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.23'>And after he had eaten and was filled he said unto Amulek: I am Alma, and am the high priest over the church of God throughout the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.24'>And behold, I have been called to preach the word of God among all this people, according to the spirit of revelation and prophecy; and I was in this land and they would not receive me, but they cast me out and I was about to set my back towards this land forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.25'>But behold, I have been commanded that I should turn again and prophesy unto this people, yea, and to testify against them concerning their iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.26'>And now, Amulek, because thou hast fed me and taken me in, thou art blessed; for I was an hungered, for I had fasted many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.27'>And Alma tarried many days with Amulek before he began to preach unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.28'>And it came to pass that the people did wax more gross in their iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.29'>And the word came to Alma, saying: Go; and also say unto my servant Amulek, go forth and prophesy unto this people, saying-Repent ye, for thus saith the Lord, except ye repent I will visit this people in mine anger; yea, and I will not turn my fierce anger away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.30'>And Alma went forth, and also Amulek, among the people, to declare the words of God unto them; and they were filled with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.31'>And they had power given unto them, insomuch that they could not be confined in dungeons; neither was it possible that any man could slay them; nevertheless they did not exercise their power until they were bound in bands and cast into prison. Now, this was done that the Lord might show forth his power in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.32'>And it came to pass that they went forth and began to preach and to prophesy unto the people, according to the spirit and power which the Lord had given them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.9'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.1'>AND again, I, Alma, having been commanded of God that I should take Amulek and go forth and preach again unto this people, or the people who were in the city of Ammonihah, it came to pass as I began to preach unto them, they began to contend with me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.2'>Who art thou? Suppose ye that we shall believe the testimony of one man, although he should preach unto us that the earth should pass away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.3'>Now they understood not the words which they spake; for they knew not that the earth should pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.4'>And they said also: We will not believe thy words if thou shouldst prophesy that this great city should be destroyed in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.5'>Now they knew not that God could do such marvelous works, for they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.6'>And they said: Who is God, that sendeth no more authority than one man among this people, to declare unto them the truth of such great and marvelous things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.7'>And they stood forth to lay their hands on me; but behold, they did not. And I stood with boldness to declare unto them, yea, I did boldly testify unto them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.8'>Behold, O ye wicked and perverse generation, how have ye forgotten the tradition of your fathers; yea, how soon ye have forgotten the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.9'>Do ye not remember that our father, Lehi, was brought out of Jerusalem by the hand of God? Do ye not remember that they were all led by him through the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.10'>And have ye forgotten so soon how many times he delivered our fathers out of the hands of their enemies, and preserved them from being destroyed, even by the hands of their own brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.11'>Yea, and if it had not been for his matchless power, and his mercy, and his long-suffering towards us, we should unavoidably have been cut off from the face of the earth long before this period of time, and perhaps been consigned to a state of endless misery and woe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.12'>Behold, now I say unto you that he commandeth you to repent; and except ye repent, ye can in nowise inherit the kingdom of God. But behold, this is not all-he has commanded you to repent, or he will utterly destroy you from off the face of the earth; yea, he will visit you in his anger, and in his fierce anger he will not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.13'>Behold, do ye not remember the words which he spake unto Lehi, saying that: Inasmuch as ye shall keep my commandments, ye shall prosper in the land? And again it is said that: Inasmuch as ye will not keep my commandments ye shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.14'>Now I would that ye should remember, that inasmuch as the Lamanites have not kept the commandments of God, they have been cut off from the presence of the Lord. Now we see that the word of the Lord has been verified in this thing, and the Lamanites have been cut off from his presence, from the beginning of their transgressions in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.15'>Nevertheless I say unto you, that it shall be more tolerable for them in the day of judgment than for you, if ye remain in your sins, yea, and even more tolerable for them in this life than for you, except ye repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.16'>For there are many promises which are extended to the Lamanites; for it is because of the traditions of their fathers that caused them to remain in their state of ignorance; therefore the Lord will be merciful unto them and prolong their existence in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.17'>And at some period of time they will be brought to believe in his word, and to know of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers; and many of them will be saved, for the Lord will be merciful unto all who call on his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.18'>But behold, I say unto you that if ye persist in your wickedness that your days shall not be prolonged in the land, for the Lamanites shall be sent upon you; and if ye repent not they shall come in a time when you know not, and ye shall be visited with utter destruction; and it shall be according to the fierce anger of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.19'>For he will not suffer you that ye shall live in your iniquities, to destroy his people. I say unto you, Nay; he would rather suffer that the Lamanites might destroy all his people who are called the people of Nephi, if it were possible that they could fall into sins and transgressions, after having had so much light and so much knowledge given unto them of the Lord their God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.20'>Yea, after having been such a highly favored people of the Lord; yea, after having been favored above every other nation, kindred, tongue, or people; after having had all things made known unto them, according to their desires, and their faith, and prayers, of that which has been, and which is, and which is to come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.21'>Having been visited by the Spirit of God; having conversed with angels, and having been spoken unto by the voice of the Lord; and having the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and also many gifts, the gift of speaking with tongues, and the gift of preaching, and the gift of the Holy Ghost, and the gift of translation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.22'>Yea, and after having been delivered of God out of the land of Jerusalem, by the hand of the Lord; having been saved from famine, and from sickness, and all manner of diseases of every kind; and they having waxed strong in battle, that they might not be destroyed; having been brought out of bondage time after time, and having been kept and preserved until now; and they have been prospered until they are rich in all manner of things-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.23'>And now behold I say unto you, that if this people, who have received so many blessings from the hand of the Lord, should transgress contrary to the light and knowledge which they do have, I say unto you that if this be the case, that if they should fall into transgression, it would be far more tolerable for the Lamanites than for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.24'>For behold, the promises of the Lord are extended to the Lamanites, but they are not unto you if ye transgress; for has not the Lord expressly promised and firmly decreed, that if ye will rebel against him that ye shall utterly be destroyed from off the face of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.25'>And now for this cause, that ye may not be destroyed, the Lord has sent his angel to visit many of his people, declaring unto them that they must go forth and cry mightily unto this people, saying: Repent ye, for the kingdom of heaven is nigh at hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.26'>And not many days hence the Son of God shall come in his glory; and his glory shall be the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace, equity, and truth, full of patience, mercy, and long-suffering, quick to hear the cries of his people and to answer their prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.27'>And behold, he cometh to redeem those who will be baptized unto repentance, through faith on his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.28'>Therefore, prepare ye the way of the Lord, for the time is at hand that all men shall reap a reward of their works, according to that which they have been-if they have been righteous they shall reap the salvation of their souls, according to the power and deliverance of Jesus Christ; and if they have been evil they shall reap the damnation of their souls, according to the power and captivation of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.29'>Now behold, this is the voice of the angel, crying unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.30'>And now, my beloved brethren, for ye are my brethren, and ye ought to be beloved, and ye ought to bring forth works which are meet for repentance, seeing that your hearts have been grossly hardened against the word of God, and seeing that ye are a lost and a fallen people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.31'>Now it came to pass that when I, Alma, had spoken these words, behold, the people were wroth with me because I said unto them that they were a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.32'>And also because I said unto them that they were a lost and a fallen people they were angry with me, and sought to lay their hands upon me, that they might cast me into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.33'>But it came to pass that the Lord did not suffer them that they should take me at that time and cast me into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.34'>And it came to pass that Amulek went and stood forth, and began to preach unto them also. And now the words of Amulek are not all written, nevertheless a part of his words are written in this book.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.10'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.1'>NOW these are the words which Amulek preached unto the people who were in the land of Ammonihah, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.2'>I am Amulek; I am the son of Giddonah, who was the son of Ishmael, who was a descendant of Aminadi; and it was that same Aminadi who interpreted the writing which was upon the wall of the temple, which was written by the finger of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.3'>And Aminadi was a descendant of Nephi, who was the son of Lehi, who came out of the land of Jerusalem, who was a descendant of Manasseh, who was the son of Joseph who was sold into Egypt by the hands of his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.4'>And behold, I am also a man of no small reputation among all those who know me; yea, and behold, I have many kindreds and friends, and I have also acquired much riches by the hand of my industry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.5'>Nevertheless, after all this, I never have known much of the ways of the Lord, and his mysteries and marvelous power. I said I never had known much of these things; but behold, I mistake, for I have seen much of his mysteries and his marvelous power; yea, even in the preservation of the lives of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.6'>Nevertheless, I did harden my heart, for I was called many times and I would not hear; therefore I knew concerning these things, yet I would not know; therefore I went on rebelling against God, in the wickedness of my heart, even until the fourth day of this seventh month, which is in the tenth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.7'>As I was journeying to see a very near kindred, behold an angel of the Lord appeared unto me and said: Amulek, return to thine own house, for thou shalt feed a prophet of the Lord; yea, a holy man, who is a chosen man of God; for he has fasted many days because of the sins of this people, and he is an hungered, and thou shalt receive him into thy house and feed him, and he shall bless thee and thy house; and the blessing of the Lord shall rest upon thee and thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.8'>And it came to pass that I obeyed the voice of the angel, and returned towards my house. And as I was going thither I found the man whom the angel said unto me: Thou shalt receive into thy house-and behold it was this same man who has been speaking unto you concerning the things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.9'>And the angel said unto me he is a holy man; wherefore I know he is a holy man because it was said by an angel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.10'>And again, I know that the things whereof he hath testified are true; for behold I say unto you, that as the Lord liveth, even so has he sent his angel to make these things manifest unto me; and this he has done while this Alma hath dwelt at my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.11'>For behold, he hath blessed mine house, he hath blessed me, and my women, and my children, and my father and my kinsfolk; yea, even all my kindred hath he blessed, and the blessing of the Lord hath rested upon us according to the words which he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.12'>And now, when Amulek had spoken these words the people began to be astonished, seeing there was more than one witness who testified of the things whereof they were accused, and also of the things which were to come, according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.13'>Nevertheless, there were some among them who thought to question them, that by their cunning devices they might catch them in their words, that they might find witness against them, that they might deliver them to their judges that they might be judged according to the law, and that they might be slain or cast into prison, according to the crime which they could make appear or witness against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.14'>Now it was those men who sought to destroy them, who were lawyers, who were hired or appointed by the people to administer the law at their times of trials, or at the trials of the crimes of the people before the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.15'>Now these lawyers were learned in all the arts and cunning of the people; and this was to enable them that they might be skilful in their profession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.16'>And it came to pass that they began to question Amulek, that thereby they might make him cross his words, or contradict the words which he should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.17'>Now they knew not that Amulek could know of their designs. But it came to pass as they began to question him, he perceived their thoughts, and he said unto them: O ye wicked and perverse generation, ye lawyers and hypocrites, for ye are laying the foundations of the devil; for ye are laying traps and snares to catch the holy ones of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.18'>Ye are laying plans to pervert the ways of the righteous, and to bring down the wrath of God upon your heads, even to the utter destruction of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.19'>Yea, well did Mosiah say, who was our last king, when he was about to deliver up the kingdom, having no one to confer it upon, causing that this people should be governed by their own voices-yea, well did he say that if the time should come that the voice of this people should choose iniquity, that is, if the time should come that this people should fall into transgression, they would be ripe for destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.20'>And now I say unto you that well doth the Lord judge of your iniquities; well doth he cry unto this people, by the voice of his angels: Repent ye, repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.21'>Yea, well doth he cry, by the voice of his angels that: I will come down among my people, with equity and justice in my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.22'>Yea, and I say unto you that if it were not for the prayers of the righteous, who are now in the land, that ye would even now be visited with utter destruction; yet it would not be by flood, as were the people in the days of Noah, but it would be by famine, and by pestilence, and the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.23'>But it is by the prayers of the righteous that ye are spared; now therefore, if ye will cast out the righteous from among you then will not the Lord stay his hand; but in his fierce anger he will come out against you; then ye shall be smitten by famine, and by pestilence, and by the sword; and the time is soon at hand except ye repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.24'>And now it came to pass that the people were more angry with Amulek, and they cried out, saying: This man doth revile against our laws which are just, and our wise lawyers whom we have selected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.25'>But Amulek stretched forth his hand, and cried the mightier unto them, saying: O ye wicked and perverse generation, why hath Satan got such great hold upon your hearts? Why will ye yield yourselves unto him that he may have power over you, to blind your eyes, that ye will not understand the words which are spoken, according to their truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.26'>For behold, have I testified against your law? Ye do not understand; ye say that I have spoken against your law; but I have not, but I have spoken in favor of your law, to your condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.27'>And now behold, I say unto you, that the foundation of the destruction of this people is beginning to be laid by the unrighteousness of your lawyers and your judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.28'>And now it came to pass that when Amulek had spoken these words the people cried out against him, saying: Now we know that this man is a child of the devil, for he hath lied unto us; for he hath spoken against our law. And now he says that he has not spoken against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.29'>And again, he has reviled against our lawyers, and our judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.30'>And it came to pass that the lawyers put it into their hearts that they should remember these things against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.31'>And there was one among them whose name was Zeezrom. Now he was the foremost to accuse Amulek and Alma, he being one of the most expert among them, having much business to do among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.32'>Now the object of these lawyers was to get gain; and they got gain according to their employ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.11'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.1'>NOW it was in the law of Mosiah that every man who was a judge of the law, or those who were appointed to be judges, should receive wages according to the time which they labored to judge those who were brought before them to be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.2'>Now if a man owed another, and he would not pay that which he did owe, he was complained of to the judge; and the judge executed authority, and sent forth officers that the man should be brought before him; and he judged the man according to the law and the evidences which were brought against him, and thus the man was compelled to pay that which he owed, or be stripped, or be cast out from among the people as a thief and a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.3'>And the judge received for his wages according to his time-a senine of gold for a day, or a senum of silver, which is equal to a senine of gold; and this is according to the law which was given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.4'>Now these are the names of the different pieces of their gold, and of their silver, according to their value. And the names are given by the Nephites, for they did not reckon after the manner of the Jews who were at Jerusalem; neither did they measure after the manner of the Jews; but they altered their reckoning and their measure, according to the minds and the circumstances of the people, in every generation, until the reign of the judges, they having been established by king Mosiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.5'>Now the reckoning is thus-a senine of gold, a seon of gold, a shum of gold, and a limnah of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.6'>A senum of silver, an amnor of silver, an ezrom of silver, and an onti of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.7'>A senum of silver was equal to a senine of gold, and either for a measure of barley, and also for a measure of every kind of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.8'>Now the amount of a seon of gold was twice the value of a senine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.9'>And a shum of gold was twice the value of a seon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.10'>And a limnah of gold was the value of them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.11'>And an amnor of silver was as great as two senums.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.12'>And an ezrom of silver was as great as four senums.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.13'>And an onti was as great as them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.14'>Now this is the value of the lesser numbers of their reckoning-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.15'>A shiblon is half of a senum; therefore, a shiblon for half a measure of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.16'>And a shiblum is a half of a shiblon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.17'>And a leah is the half of a shiblum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.18'>Now this is their number, according to their reckoning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.19'>Now an antion of gold is equal to three shiblons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.20'>Now, it was for the sole purpose to get gain, because they received their wages according to their employ, therefore, they did stir up the people to riotings, and all manner of disturbances and wickedness, that they might have more employ, that they might get money according to the suits which were brought before them; therefore they did stir up the people against Alma and Amulek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.21'>And this Zeezrom began to question Amulek, saying: Will ye answer me a few questions which I shall ask you? Now Zeezrom was a man who was expert in the devices of the devil, that he might destroy that which was good; therefore, he said unto Amulek: Will ye answer the questions which I shall put unto you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.22'>And Amulek said unto him: Yea, if it be according to the Spirit of the Lord, which is in me; for I shall say nothing which is contrary to the Spirit of the Lord. And Zeezrom said unto him: Behold, here are six onties of silver, and all these will I give thee if thou wilt deny the existence of a Supreme Being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.23'>Now Amulek said: O thou child of hell, why tempt ye me? Knowest thou that the righteous yieldeth to no such temptations?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.24'>Believest thou that there is no God? I say unto you, Nay, thou knowest that there is a God, but thou lovest that lucre more than him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.25'>And now thou hast lied before God unto me. Thou saidst unto me-Behold these six onties, which are of great worth, I will give unto thee-when thou hadst it in thy heart to retain them from me; and it was only thy desire that I should deny the true and living God, that thou mightest have cause to destroy me. And now behold, for this great evil thou shalt have thy reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.26'>And Zeezrom said unto him: Thou sayest there is a true and living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.27'>And Amulek said: Yea, there is a true and living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.28'>Now Zeezrom said: Is there more than one God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.29'>And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.30'>Now Zeezrom said unto him again: How knowest thou these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.31'>And he said: An angel hath made them known unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.32'>And Zeezrom said again: Who is he that shall come? Is it the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.33'>And he said unto him, Yea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.34'>And Zeezrom said again: Shall he save his people in their sins? And Amulek answered and said unto him: I say unto you he shall not, for it is impossible for him to deny his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.35'>Now Zeezrom said unto the people: See that ye remember these things; for he said there is but one God; yet he saith that the Son of God shall come, but he shall not save his people-as though he had authority to command God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.36'>Now Amulek saith again unto him: Behold thou hast lied, for thou sayest that I spake as though I had authority to command God because I said he shall not save his people in their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.37'>And I say unto you again that he cannot save them in their sins; for I cannot deny his word, and he hath said that no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of heaven; therefore, how can ye be saved, except ye inherit the kingdom of heaven? Therefore, ye cannot be saved in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.38'>Now Zeezrom saith again unto him: Is the Son of God the very Eternal Father?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.39'>And Amulek said unto him: Yea, he is the very Eternal Father of heaven and of earth, and all things which in them are; he is the beginning and the end, the first and the last;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.40'>And he shall come into the world to redeem his people; and he shall take upon him the transgressions of those who believe on his name; and these are they that shall have eternal life, and salvation cometh to none else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.41'>Therefore the wicked remain as though there had been no redemption made, except it be the loosing of the bands of death; for behold, the day cometh that all shall rise from the dead and stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.42'>Now, there is a death which is called a temporal death; and the death of Christ shall loose the bands of this temporal death, that all shall be raised from this temporal death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.43'>The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form; both limb and joint shall be restored to its proper frame, even as we now are at this time; and we shall be brought to stand before God, knowing even as we know now, and have a bright recollection of all our guilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.44'>Now, this restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame, as it is now, or in the body, and shall be brought and be arraigned before the bar of Christ the Son, and God the Father, and the Holy Spirit, which is one Eternal God, to be judged according to their works, whether they be good or whether they be evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.45'>Now, behold, I have spoken unto you concerning the death of the mortal body, and also concerning the resurrection of the mortal body. I say unto you that this mortal body is raised to an immortal body, that is from death, even from the first death unto life, that they can die no more; their spirits uniting with their bodies, never to be divided; thus the whole becoming spiritual and immortal, that they can no more see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.46'>Now, when Amulek had finished these words the people began again to be astonished, and also Zeezrom began to tremble. And thus ended the words of Amulek, or this is all that I have written.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.1'>NOW Alma, seeing that the words of Amulek had silenced Zeezrom, for he beheld that Amulek had caught him in his lying and deceiving to destroy him, and seeing that he began to tremble under a consciousness of his guilt, he opened his mouth and began to speak unto him, and to establish the words of Amulek, and to explain things beyond, or to unfold the scriptures beyond that which Amulek had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.2'>Now the words that Alma spake unto Zeezrom were heard by the people round about; for the multitude was great, and he spake on this wise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.3'>Now Zeezrom, seeing that thou hast been taken in thy lying and craftiness, for thou hast not lied unto men only but thou hast lied unto God; for behold, he knows all thy thoughts, and thou seest that thy thoughts are made known unto us by his Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.4'>And thou seest that we know that thy plan was a very subtle plan, as to the subtlety of the devil, for to lie and to deceive this people that thou mightest set them against us, to revile us and to cast us out-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.5'>Now this was a plan of thine adversary, and he hath exercised his power in thee. Now I would that ye should remember that what I say unto thee I say unto all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.6'>And behold I say unto you all that this was a snare of the adversary, which he has laid to catch this people, that he might bring you into subjection unto him, that he might encircle you about with his chains, that he might chain you down to everlasting destruction, according to the power of his captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.7'>Now when Alma had spoken these words, Zeezrom began to tremble more exceedingly, for he was convinced more and more of the power of God; and he was also convinced that Alma and Amulek had a knowledge of him, for he was convinced that they knew the thoughts and intents of his heart; for power was given unto them that they might know of these things according to the spirit of prophecy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.8'>And Zeezrom began to inquire of them diligently, that he might know more concerning the kingdom of God. And he said unto Alma: What does this mean which Amulek hath spoken concerning the resurrection of the dead, that all shall rise from the dead, both the just and the unjust, and are brought to stand before God to be judged according to their works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.9'>And now Alma began to expound these things unto him, saying: It is given unto many to know the mysteries of God; nevertheless they are laid under a strict command that they shall not impart only according to the portion of his word which he doth grant unto the children of men, according to the heed and diligence which they give unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.10'>And therefore, he that will harden his heart, the same receiveth the lesser portion of the word; and he that will not harden his heart, to him is given the greater portion of the word, until it is given unto him to know the mysteries of God until he know them in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.11'>And they that will harden their hearts, to them is given the lesser portion of the word until they know nothing concerning his mysteries; and then they are taken captive by the devil, and led by his will down to destruction. Now this is what is meant by the chains of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.12'>And Amulek hath spoken plainly concerning death, and being raised from this mortality to a state of immortality, and being brought before the bar of God, to be judged according to our works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.13'>Then if our hearts have been hardened, yea, if we have hardened our hearts against the word, insomuch that it has not been found in us, then will our state be awful, for then we shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.14'>For our words will condemn us, yea, all our works will condemn us; we shall not be found spotless; and our thoughts will also condemn us; and in this awful state we shall not dare to look up to our God; and we would fain be glad if we could command the rocks and the mountains to fall upon us to hide us from his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.15'>But this cannot be; we must come forth and stand before him in his glory, and in his power, and in his might, majesty, and dominion, and acknowledge to our everlasting shame that all his judgments are just; that he is just in all his works, and that he is merciful unto the children of men, and that he has all power to save every man that believeth on his name and bringeth forth fruit meet for repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.16'>And now behold, I say unto you then cometh a death, even a second death, which is a spiritual death; then is a time that whosoever dieth in his sins, as to a temporal death, shall also die a spiritual death; yea, he shall die as to things pertaining unto righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.17'>Then is the time when their torments shall be as a lake of fire and brimstone, whose flame ascendeth up forever and ever; and then is the time that they shall be chained down to an everlasting destruction, according to the power and captivity of Satan, he having subjected them according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.18'>Then, I say unto you, they shall be as though there had been no redemption made; for they cannot be redeemed according to God's justice; and they cannot die, seeing there is no more corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.19'>Now it came to pass that when Alma had made an end of speaking these words, the people began to be more astonished;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.20'>But there was one Antionah, who was a chief ruler among them, came forth and said unto him: What is this that thou hast said, that man should rise from the dead and be changed from this mortal to an immortal state, that the soul can never die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.21'>What does the scripture mean, which saith that God placed cherubim and a flaming sword on the east of the garden of Eden, lest our first parents should enter and partake of the fruit of the tree of life, and live forever? And thus we see that there was no possible chance that they should live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.22'>Now Alma said unto him: This is the thing which I was about to explain. Now we see that Adam did fall by the partaking of the forbidden fruit, according to the word of God; and thus we see, that by his fall, all mankind became a lost and fallen people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.23'>And now behold, I say unto you that if it had been possible for Adam to have partaken of the fruit of the tree of life at that time, there would have been no death, and the word would have been void, making God a liar, for he said: If thou eat thou shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.24'>And we see that death comes upon mankind, yea, the death which has been spoken of by Amulek, which is the temporal death; nevertheless there was a space granted unto man in which he might repent; therefore this life became a probationary state; a time to prepare to meet God; a time to prepare for that endless state which has been spoken of by us, which is after the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.25'>Now, if it had not been for the plan of redemption, which was laid from the foundation of the world, there could have been no resurrection of the dead; but there was a plan of redemption laid, which shall bring to pass the resurrection of the dead, of which has been spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.26'>And now behold, if it were possible that our first parents could have gone forth and partaken of the tree of life they would have been forever miserable, having no preparatory state; and thus the plan of redemption would have been frustrated, and the word of God would have been void, taking none effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.27'>But behold, it was not so; but it was appointed unto men that they must die; and after death, they must come to judgment, even that same judgment of which we have spoken, which is the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.28'>And after God had appointed that these things should come unto man, behold, then he saw that it was expedient that man should know concerning the things whereof he had appointed unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.29'>Therefore he sent angels to converse with them, who caused men to behold of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.30'>And they began from that time forth to call on his name; therefore God conversed with men, and made known unto them the plan of redemption, which had been prepared from the foundation of the world; and this he made known unto them according to their faith and repentance and their holy works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.31'>Wherefore, he gave commandments unto men, they having first transgressed the first commandments as to things which were temporal, and becoming as Gods, knowing good from evil, placing themselves in a state to act, or being placed in a state to act according to their wills and pleasures, whether to do evil or to do good-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.32'>Therefore God gave unto them commandments, after having made known unto them the plan of redemption, that they should not do evil, the penalty thereof being a second death, which was an everlasting death as to things pertaining unto righteousness; for on such the plan of redemption could have no power, for the works of justice could not be destroyed, according to the supreme goodness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.33'>But God did call on men, in the name of his Son, (this being the plan of redemption which was laid) saying: If ye will repent, and harden not your hearts, then will I have mercy upon you, through mine Only Begotten Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.34'>Therefore, whosoever repenteth, and hardeneth not his heart, he shall have claim on mercy through mine Only Begotten Son, unto a remission of his sins; and these shall enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.35'>And whosoever will harden his heart and will do iniquity, behold, I swear in my wrath that he shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.36'>And now, my brethren, behold I say unto you, that if ye will harden your hearts ye shall not enter into the rest of the Lord; therefore your iniquity provoketh him that he sendeth down his wrath upon you as in the first provocation, yea, according to his word in the last provocation as well as the first, to the everlasting destruction of your souls; therefore, according to his word, unto the last death, as well as the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.12.37'>And now, my brethren, seeing we know these things, and they are true, let us repent, and harden not our hearts, that we provoke not the Lord our God to pull down his wrath upon us in these his second commandments which he has given unto us; but let us enter into the rest of God, which is prepared according to his word.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.1'>AND again, my brethren, I would cite your minds forward to the time when the Lord God gave these commandments unto his children; and I would that ye should remember that the Lord God ordained priests, after his holy order, which was after the order of his Son, to teach these things unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.2'>And those priests were ordained after the order of his Son, in a manner that thereby the people might know in what manner to look forward to his Son for redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>And this is the manner after which they were ordained-being called and prepared from the foundation of the world according to the foreknowledge of God, on account of their exceeding faith and good works; in the first place being left to choose good or evil; therefore they having chosen good, and exercising exceedingly great faith, are called with a holy calling, yea, with that holy calling which was prepared with, and according to, a preparatory redemption for such.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>And thus they have been called to this holy calling on account of their faith, while others would reject the Spirit of God on account of the hardness of their hearts and blindness of their minds, while, if it had not been for this they might have had as great privilege as their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>Or in fine, in the first place they were on the same standing with their brethren; thus this holy calling being prepared from the foundation of the world for such as would not harden their hearts, being in and through the atonement of the Only Begotten Son, who was prepared-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>And thus being called by this holy calling, and ordained unto the high priesthood of the holy order of God, to teach his commandments unto the children of men, that they also might enter into his rest-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>This high priesthood being after the order of his Son, which order was from the foundation of the world; or in other words, being without beginning of days or end of years, being prepared from eternity to all eternity, according to his foreknowledge of all things-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.8'>Now they were ordained after this manner-being called with a holy calling, and ordained with a holy ordinance, and taking upon them the high priesthood of the holy order, which calling, and ordinance, and high priesthood, is without beginning or end-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.9'>Thus they become high priests forever, after the order of the Son, the Only Begotten of the Father, who is without beginning of days or end of years, who is full of grace, equity, and truth. And thus it is. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.10'>Now, as I said concerning the holy order, or this high priesthood, there were many who were ordained and became high priests of God; and it was on account of their exceeding faith and repentance, and their righteousness before God, they choosing to repent and work righteousness rather than to perish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.11'>Therefore they were called after this holy order, and were sanctified, and their garments were washed white through the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>Now they, after being sanctified by the Holy Ghost, having their garments made white, being pure and spotless before God, could not look upon sin save it were with abhorrence; and there were many, exceedingly great many, who were made pure and entered into the rest of the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>And now, my brethren, I would that ye should humble yourselves before God, and bring forth fruit meet for repentance, that ye may also enter into that rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.14'>Yea, humble yourselves even as the people in the days of Melchizedek, who was also a high priest after this same order which I have spoken, who also took upon him the high priesthood forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.15'>And it was this same Melchizedek to whom Abraham paid tithes; yea, even our father Abraham paid tithes of one-tenth part of all he possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.16'>Now these ordinances were given after this manner, that thereby the people might look forward on the Son of God, it being a type of his order, or it being his order, and this that they might look forward to him for a remission of their sins, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.17'>Now this Melchizedek was a king over the land of Salem; and his people had waxed strong in iniquity and abomination; yea, they had all gone astray; they were full of all manner of wickedness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.18'>But Melchizedek having exercised mighty faith, and received the office of the high priesthood according to the holy order of God, did preach repentance unto his people. And behold, they did repent; and Melchizedek did establish peace in the land in his days; therefore he was called the prince of peace, for he was the king of Salem; and he did reign under his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.19'>Now, there were many before him, and also there were many afterwards, but none were greater; therefore, of him they have more particularly made mention.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.21'>And now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words unto them, he stretched forth his hand unto them and cried with a mighty voice, saying: Now is the time to repent, for the day of salvation draweth nigh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.22'>Yea, and the voice of the Lord, by the mouth of angels, doth declare it unto all nations; yea, doth declare it, that they may have glad tidings of great joy; yea, and he doth sound these glad tidings among all his people, yea, even to them that are scattered abroad upon the face of the earth; wherefore they have come unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.23'>And they are made known unto us in plain terms, that we may understand, that we cannot err; and this because of our being wanderers in a strange land; therefore, we are thus highly favored, for we have these glad tidings declared unto us in all parts of our vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.24'>For behold, angels are declaring it unto many at this time in our land; and this is for the purpose of preparing the hearts of the children of men to receive his word at the time of his coming in his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.25'>And now we only wait to hear the joyful news declared unto us by the mouth of angels, of his coming; for the time cometh, we know not how soon. Would to God that it might be in my day; but let it be sooner or later, in it I will rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.26'>And it shall be made known unto just and holy men, by the mouth of angels, at the time of his coming, that the words of our fathers may be fulfilled, according to that which they have spoken concerning him, which was according to the spirit of prophecy which was in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.27'>And now, my brethren, I wish from the inmost part of my heart, yea, with great anxiety even unto pain, that ye would hearken unto my words, and cast off your sins, and not procrastinate the day of your repentance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.28'>But that ye would humble yourselves before the Lord, and call on his holy name, and watch and pray continually, that ye may not be tempted above that which ye can bear, and thus be led by the Holy Spirit, becoming humble, meek, submissive, patient, full of love and all long-suffering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.29'>Having faith on the Lord; having a hope that ye shall receive eternal life; having the love of God always in your hearts, that ye may be lifted up at the last day and enter into his rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.30'>And may the Lord grant unto you repentance, that ye may not bring down his wrath upon you, that ye may not be bound down by the chains of hell, that ye may not suffer the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.31'>And Alma spake many more words unto the people, which are not written in this book.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.1'>AND it came to pass after he had made an end of speaking unto the people many of them did believe on his words, and began to repent, and to search the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.2'>But the more part of them were desirous that they might destroy Alma and Amulek; for they were angry with Alma, because of the plainness of his words unto Zeezrom; and they also said that Amulek had lied unto them, and had reviled against their law and also against their lawyers and judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.3'>And they were also angry with Alma and Amulek; and because they had testified so plainly against their wickedness, they sought to put them away privily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>But it came to pass that they did not; but they took them and bound them with strong cords, and took them before the chief judge of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.5'>And the people went forth and witnessed against them-testifying that they had reviled against the law, and their lawyers and judges of the land, and also of all the people that were in the land; and also testified that there was but one God, and that he should send his Son among the people, but he should not save them; and many such things did the people testify against Alma and Amulek. Now this was done before the chief judge of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>And it came to pass that Zeezrom was astonished at the words which had been spoken; and he also knew concerning the blindness of the minds, which he had caused among the people by his lying words; and his soul began to be harrowed up under a consciousness of his own guilt; yea, he began to be encircled about by the pains of hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.7'>And it came to pass that he began to cry unto the people, saying: Behold, I am guilty, and these men are spotless before God. And he began to plead for them from that time forth; but they reviled him, saying: Art thou also possessed with the devil? And they spit upon him, and cast him out from among them, and also all those who believed in the words which had been spoken by Alma and Amulek; and they cast them out, and sent men to cast stones at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.8'>And they brought their wives and children together, and whosoever believed or had been taught to believe in the word of God they caused that they should be cast into the fire; and they also brought forth their records which contained the holy scriptures, and cast them into the fire also, that they might be burned and destroyed by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.9'>And it came to pass that they took Alma and Amulek, and carried them forth to the place of martyrdom, that they might witness the destruction of those who were consumed by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.10'>And when Amulek saw the pains of the women and children who were consuming in the fire, he also was pained; and he said unto Alma: How can we witness this awful scene? Therefore let us stretch forth our hands, and exercise the power of God which is in us, and save them from the flames.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.11'>But Alma said unto him: The Spirit constraineth me that I must not stretch forth mine hand; for behold the Lord receiveth them up unto himself, in glory; and he doth suffer that they may do this thing, or that the people may do this thing unto them, according to the hardness of their hearts, that the judgments which he shall exercise upon them in his wrath may be just; and the blood of the innocent shall stand as a witness against them, yea, and cry mightily against them at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.12'>Now Amulek said unto Alma: Behold, perhaps they will burn us also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>And Alma said: Be it according to the will of the Lord. But, behold, our work is not finished; therefore they burn us not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>Now it came to pass that when the bodies of those who had been cast into the fire were consumed, and also the records which were cast in with them, the chief judge of the land came and stood before Alma and Amulek, as they were bound; and he smote them with his hand upon their cheeks, and said unto them: After what ye have seen, will ye preach again unto this people, that they shall be cast into a lake of fire and brimstone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>Behold, ye see that ye had not power to save those who had been cast into the fire; neither has God saved them because they were of thy faith. And the judge smote them again upon their cheeks, and asked: What say ye for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.16'>Now this judge was after the order and faith of Nehor, who slew Gideon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.17'>And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek answered him nothing; and he smote them again, and delivered them to the officers to be cast into prison.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.19'>And it came to pass that the judge stood before them, and said: Why do ye not answer the words of this people? Know ye not that I have power to deliver you up unto the flames? And he commanded them to speak; but they answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.20'>And it came to pass that they departed and went their ways, but came again on the morrow; and the judge also smote them again on their cheeks. And many came forth also, and smote them, saying: Will ye stand again and judge this people, and condemn our law? If ye have such great power why do ye not deliver yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.21'>And many such things did they say unto them, gnashing their teeth upon them, and spitting upon them, and saying: How shall we look when we are damned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.22'>And many such things, yea, all manner of such things did they say unto them; and thus they did mock them for many days. And they did withhold food from them that they might hunger, and water that they might thirst; and they also did take from them their clothes that they were naked; and thus they were bound with strong cords, and confined in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.23'>And it came to pass after they had thus suffered for many days, (and it was on the twelfth day, in the tenth month, *in the tenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi) that the chief judge over the land of Ammonihah and many of their teachers and their lawyers went in unto the prison where Alma and Amulek were bound with cords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.24'>And the chief judge stood before them, and smote them again, and said unto them: If ye have the power of God deliver yourselves from these bands, and then we will believe that the Lord will destroy this people according to your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.25'>And it came to pass that they all went forth and smote them, saying the same words, even until the last; and when the last had spoken unto them the power of God was upon Alma and Amulek, and they rose and stood upon their feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.26'>And Alma cried, saying: How long shall we suffer these great afflictions, O Lord? O Lord, give us strength according to our faith which is in Christ, even unto deliverance. And they broke the cords with which they were bound; and when the people saw this, they began to flee, for the fear of destruction had come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.27'>And it came to pass that so great was their fear that they fell to the earth, and did not obtain the outer door of the prison; and the earth shook mightily, and the walls of the prison were rent in twain, so that they fell to the earth; and the chief judge, and the lawyers, and priests, and teachers, who smote upon Alma and Amulek, were slain by the fall thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.28'>And Alma and Amulek came forth out of the prison, and they were not hurt; for the Lord had granted unto them power, according to their faith which was in Christ. And they straightway came forth out of the prison; and they were loosed from their bands; and the prison had fallen to the earth, and every soul within the walls thereof, save it were Alma and Amulek, was slain; and they straightway came forth into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.29'>Now the people having heard a great noise came running together by multitudes to know the cause of it; and when they saw Alma and Amulek coming forth out of the prison, and the walls thereof had fallen to the earth, they were struck with great fear, and fled from the presence of Alma and Amulek even as a goat fleeth with her young from two lions; and thus they did flee from the presence of Alma and Amulek.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.2'>And they related unto them all that had happened unto their wives and children, and also concerning themselves, and of their power of deliverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.3'>And also Zeezrom lay sick at Sidom, with a burning fever, which was caused by the great tribulations of his mind on account of his wickedness, for he supposed that Alma and Amulek were no more; and he supposed that they had been slain because of his iniquity. And this great sin, and his many other sins, did harrow up his mind until it did become exceedingly sore, having no deliverance; therefore he began to be scorched with a burning heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.4'>Now, when he heard that Alma and Amulek were in the land of Sidom, his heart began to take courage; and he sent a message immediately unto them, desiring them to come unto him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.6'>And it came to pass that Alma said unto him, taking him by the hand: Believest thou in the power of Christ unto salvation?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.12'>And Alma baptized Zeezrom unto the Lord; and he began from that time forth to preach unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.13'>And Alma established a church in the land of Sidom, and consecrated priests and teachers in the land, to baptize unto the Lord whosoever were desirous to be baptized.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.15'>But as to the people that were in the land of Ammonihah, they yet remained a hard-hearted and a stiffnecked people; and they repented not of their sins, ascribing all the power of Alma and Amulek to the devil; for they were of the profession of Nehor, and did not believe in the repentance of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.16'>And it came to pass that Alma and Amulek, Amulek having forsaken all his gold, and silver, and his precious things, which were in the land of Ammonihah, for the word of God, he being rejected by those who were once his friends and also by his father and his kindred;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.17'>Therefore, after Alma having established the church at Sidom, seeing a great check, yea, seeing that the people were checked as to the pride of their hearts, and began to humble themselves before God, and began to assemble themselves together at their sanctuaries to worship God before the altar, watching and praying continually, that they might be delivered from Satan, and from death, and from destruction-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.18'>Now as I said, Alma having seen all these things, therefore he took Amulek and came over to the land of Zarahemla, and took him to his own house, and did administer unto him in his tribulations, and strengthened him in the Lord.</verse>

And now so great was the scent thereof that the people did not go in to possess the land of Ammonihah for many years. And it was called Desolation of Nehors; for they were of the profession of Nehor, who were slain; and their lands remained desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.12'>And the Lamanites did not come again to war against the Nephites *until the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi. And thus for three years did the people of Nephi have continual peace in all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.13'>And Alma and Amulek went forth preaching repentance to the people in their temples, and in their sanctuaries, and also in their synagogues, which were built after the manner of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.14'>And as many as would hear their words, unto them they did impart the word of God, without any respect of persons, continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.15'>And thus did Alma and Amulek go forth, and also many more who had been chosen for the work, to preach the word throughout all the land. And the establishment of the church became general throughout the land, in all the region round about, among all the people of the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.16'>And there was no inequality among them; the Lord did pour out his Spirit on all the face of the land to prepare the minds of the children of men, or to prepare their hearts to receive the word which should be taught among them at the time of his coming-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.17'>That they might not be hardened against the word, that they might not be unbelieving, and go on to destruction, but that they might receive the word with joy, and as a branch be grafted into the true vine, that they might enter into the rest of the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.18'>Now those priests who did go forth among the people did preach against all lyings, and deceivings, and envyings, and strifes, and malice, and revilings, and stealing, robbing, plundering, murdering, committing adultery, and all manner of lasciviousness, crying that these things ought not so to be-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.19'>Holding forth things which must shortly come; yea, holding forth the coming of the Son of God, his sufferings and death, and also the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.20'>And many of the people did inquire concerning the place where the Son of God should come; and they were taught that he would appear unto them after his resurrection; and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.16.21'>And now after the church had been established throughout all the land-having got the victory over the devil, and the word of God being preached in its purity in all the land, and the Lord pouring out his blessings upon the people-thus ended the fourteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.1'>AND now it came to pass that as Alma was journeying from the land of Gideon southward, away to the land of Manti, behold, to his astonishment, he met with the sons of Mosiah journeying towards the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.2'>Now these sons of Mosiah were with Alma at the time the angel first appeared unto him; therefore Alma did rejoice exceedingly to see his brethren; and what added more to his joy, they were still his brethren in the Lord; yea, and they had waxed strong in the knowledge of the truth; for they were men of a sound understanding and they had searched the scriptures diligently, that they might know the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.3'>But this is not all; they had given themselves to much prayer, and fasting; therefore they had the spirit of prophecy, and the spirit of revelation, and when they taught, they taught with power and authority of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.4'>And they had been teaching the word of God *for the space of fourteen years among the Lamanites, having had much success in bringing many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, by the power of their words many were brought before the altar of God, to call on his name and confess their sins before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.5'>Now these are the circumstances which attended them in their journeyings, for they had many afflictions; they did suffer much, both in body and in mind, such as hunger, thirst and fatigue, and also much labor in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.6'>Now these were their journeyings: Having taken leave of their father, Mosiah, in the first year of the judges; having refused the kingdom which their father was desirous to confer upon them, and also this was the minds of the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.7'>Nevertheless they departed out of the land of Zarahemla, and took their swords, and their spears, and their bows, and their arrows, and their slings; and this they did that they might provide food for themselves while in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.8'>And thus they departed into the wilderness with their numbers which they had selected, to go up to the land of Nephi, to preach the word of God unto the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.9'>And it came to pass that they journeyed many days in the wilderness, and they fasted much and prayed much that the Lord would grant unto them a portion of his Spirit to go with them, and abide with them, that they might be an instrument in the hands of God to bring, if it were possible, their brethren, the Lamanites, to the knowledge of the truth, to the knowledge of the baseness of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.10'>And it came to pass that the Lord did visit them with his Spirit, and said unto them: Be comforted. And they were comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.11'>And the Lord said unto them also: Go forth among the Lamanites, thy brethren, and establish my word; yet ye shall be patient in long-suffering and afflictions, that ye may show forth good examples unto them in me, and I will make an instrument of thee in my hands unto the salvation of many souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.12'>And it came to pass that the hearts of the sons of Mosiah, and also those who were with them, took courage to go forth unto the Lamanites to declare unto them the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.13'>And it came to pass when they had arrived in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, that they separated themselves and departed one from another, trusting in the Lord that they should meet again at the close of their harvest; for they supposed that great was the work which they had undertaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.14'>And assuredly it was great, for they had undertaken to preach the word of God to a wild and a hardened and a ferocious people; a people who delighted in murdering the Nephites, and robbing and plundering them; and their hearts were set upon riches, or upon gold and silver, and precious stones; yet they sought to obtain these things by murdering and plundering, that they might not labor for them with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.15'>Thus they were a very indolent people, many of whom did worship idols, and the curse of God had fallen upon them because of the traditions of their fathers; notwithstanding the promises of the Lord were extended unto them on the conditions of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.16'>Therefore, this was the cause for which the sons of Mosiah had undertaken the work, that perhaps they might bring them unto repentance; that perhaps they might bring them to know of the plan of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.17'>Therefore they separated themselves one from another, and went forth among them, every man alone, according to the word and power of God which was given unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.18'>Now Ammon being the chief among them, or rather he did administer unto them, and he departed from them, after having blessed them according to their several stations, having imparted the word of God unto them, or administered unto them before his departure; and thus they took their several journeys throughout the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.19'>And Ammon went to the land of Ishmael, the land being called after the sons of Ishmael, who also became Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.20'>And as Ammon entered the land of Ishmael, the Lamanites took him and bound him, as was their custom to bind all the Nephites who fell into their hands, and carry them before the king; and thus it was left to the pleasure of the king to slay them, or to retain them in captivity, or to cast them into prison, or to cast them out of his land, according to his will and pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.21'>And thus Ammon was carried before the king who was over the land of Ishmael; and his name was Lamoni; and he was a descendant of Ishmael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.22'>And the king inquired of Ammon if it were his desire to dwell in the land among the Lamanites, or among his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.23'>And Ammon said unto him: Yea, I desire to dwell among this people for a time; yea, and perhaps until the day I die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.24'>And it came to pass that king Lamoni was much pleased with Ammon, and caused that his bands should be loosed; and he would that Ammon should take one of his daughters to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.25'>But Ammon said unto him: Nay, but I will be thy servant. Therefore Ammon became a servant to king Lamoni. And it came to pass that he was set among other servants to watch the flocks of Lamoni, according to the custom of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.26'>And after he had been in the service of the king three days, as he was with the Lamanitish servants going forth with their flocks to the place of water, which was called the water of Sebus, and all the Lamanites drive their flocks hither, that they may have water-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.27'>Therefore, as Ammon and the servants of the king were driving forth their flocks to this place of water, behold, a certain number of the Lamanites, who had been with their flocks to water, stood and scattered the flocks of Ammon and the servants of the king, and they scattered them insomuch that they fled many ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.28'>Now the servants of the king began to murmur, saying: Now the king will slay us, as he has our brethren because their flocks were scattered by the wickedness of these men. And they began to weep exceedingly, saying: Behold, our flocks are scattered already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.29'>Now they wept because of the fear of being slain. Now when Ammon saw this his heart was swollen within him with joy; for, said he, I will show forth my power unto these my fellow-servants, or the power which is in me, in restoring these flocks unto the king, that I may win the hearts of these my fellow-servants, that I may lead them to believe in my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.30'>And now, these were the thoughts of Ammon, when he saw the afflictions of those whom he termed to be his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.31'>And it came to pass that he flattered them by his words, saying: My brethren, be of good cheer and let us go in search of the flocks, and we will gather them together and bring them back unto the place of water; and thus we will preserve the flocks unto the king and he will not slay us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.32'>And it came to pass that they went in search of the flocks, and they did follow Ammon, and they rushed forth with much swiftness and did head the flocks of the king, and did gather them together again to the place of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.33'>And those men again stood to scatter their flocks; but Ammon said unto his brethren: Encircle the flocks round about that they flee not; and I go and contend with these men who do scatter our flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.34'>Therefore, they did as Ammon commanded them, and he went forth and stood to contend with those who stood by the waters of Sebus; and they were in number not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.35'>Therefore they did not fear Ammon, for they supposed that one of their men could slay him according to their pleasure, for they knew not that the Lord had promised Mosiah that he would deliver his sons out of their hands; neither did they know anything concerning the Lord; therefore they delighted in the destruction of their brethren; and for this cause they stood to scatter the flocks of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.36'>But Ammon stood forth and began to cast stones at them with his sling; yea, with mighty power he did sling stones amongst them; and thus he slew a certain number of them insomuch that they began to be astonished at his power; nevertheless they were angry because of the slain of their brethren, and they were determined that he should fall; therefore, seeing that they could not hit him with their stones, they came forth with clubs to slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.37'>But behold, every man that lifted his club to smite Ammon, he smote off their arms with his sword; for he did withstand their blows by smiting their arms with the edge of his sword, insomuch that they began to be astonished, and began to flee before him; yea, and they were not few in number; and he caused them to flee by the strength of his arm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.38'>Now six of them had fallen by the sling, but he slew none save it were their leader with his sword; and he smote off as many of their arms as were lifted against him, and they were not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.39'>And when he had driven them afar off, he returned and they watered their flocks and returned them to the pasture of the king, and then went in unto the king, bearing the arms which had been smitten off by the sword of Ammon, of those who sought to slay him; and they were carried in unto the king for a testimony of the things which they had done.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.1'>AND it came to pass that king Lamoni caused that his servants should stand forth and testify to all the things which they had seen concerning the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.2'>And when they had all testified to the things which they had seen, and he had learned of the faithfulness of Ammon in preserving his flocks, and also of his great power in contending against those who sought to slay him, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Surely, this is more than a man. Behold, is not this the Great Spirit who doth send such great punishments upon this people, because of their murders?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.3'>And they answered the king, and said: Whether he be the Great Spirit or a man, we know not; but this much we do know, that he cannot be slain by the enemies of the king; neither can they scatter the king's flocks when he is with us, because of his expertness and great strength; therefore, we know that he is a friend to the king. And now, O king, we do not believe that a man has such great power, for we know he cannot be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.4'>And now, when the king heard these words, he said unto them: Now I know that it is the Great Spirit; and he has come down at this time to preserve your lives, that I might not slay you as I did your brethren. Now this is the Great Spirit of whom our fathers have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.5'>Now this was the tradition of Lamoni, which he had received from his father, that there was a Great Spirit. Notwithstanding they believed in a Great Spirit, they supposed that whatsoever they did was right; nevertheless, Lamoni began to fear exceedingly, with fear lest he had done wrong in slaying his servants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.6'>For he had slain many of them because their brethren had scattered their flocks at the place of water; and thus, because they had had their flocks scattered they were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.7'>Now it was the practice of these Lamanites to stand by the waters of Sebus to scatter the flocks of the people, that thereby they might drive away many that were scattered unto their own land, it being a practice of plunder among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.8'>And it came to pass that king Lamoni inquired of his servants, saying: Where is this man that has such great power?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.9'>And they said unto him: Behold, he is feeding thy horses. Now the king had commanded his servants, previous to the time of the watering of their flocks, that they should prepare his horses and chariots, and conduct him forth to the land of Nephi; for there had been a great feast appointed at the land of Nephi, by the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.10'>Now when king Lamoni heard that Ammon was preparing his horses and his chariots he was more astonished, because of the faithfulness of Ammon, saying: Surely there has not been any servant among all my servants that has been so faithful as this man; for even he doth remember all my commandments to execute them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.11'>Now I surely know that this is the Great Spirit, and I would desire him that he come in unto me, but I durst not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.12'>And it came to pass that when Ammon had made ready the horses and the chariots for the king and his servants, he went in unto the king, and he saw that the countenance of the king was changed; therefore he was about to return out of his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.13'>And one of the king's servants said unto him, Rabbanah, which is, being interpreted, powerful or great king, considering their kings to be powerful; and thus he said unto him: Rabbanah, the king desireth thee to stay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.14'>Therefore Ammon turned himself unto the king, and said unto him: What wilt thou that I should do for thee, O king? And the king answered him not for the space of an hour, according to their time, for he knew not what he should say unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.15'>And it came to pass that Ammon said unto him again: What desirest thou of me? But the king answered him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.16'>And it came to pass that Ammon, being filled with the Spirit of God, therefore he perceived the thoughts of the king. And he said unto him: Is it because thou hast heard that I defended thy servants and thy flocks, and slew seven of their brethren with the sling and with the sword, and smote off the arms of others, in order to defend thy flocks and thy servants; behold, is it this that causeth thy marvelings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.17'>I say unto you, what is it, that thy marvelings are so great? Behold, I am a man, and am thy servant; therefore, whatsoever thou desirest which is right, that will I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.18'>Now when the king had heard these words, he marveled again, for he beheld that Ammon could discern his thoughts; but notwithstanding this, king Lamoni did open his mouth, and said unto him: Who art thou? Art thou that Great Spirit, who knows all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.19'>Ammon answered and said unto him: I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.20'>And the king said: How knowest thou the thoughts of my heart? Thou mayest speak boldly, and tell me concerning these things; and also tell me by what power ye slew and smote off the arms of my brethren that scattered my flocks-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.21'>And now, if thou wilt tell me concerning these things, whatsoever thou desirest I will give unto thee; and if it were needed, I would guard thee with my armies; but I know that thou art more powerful than all they; nevertheless, whatsoever thou desirest of me I will grant it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.22'>Now Ammon being wise, yet harmless, he said unto Lamoni: Wilt thou hearken unto my words, if I tell thee by what power I do these things? And this is the thing that I desire of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.23'>And the king answered him, and said: Yea, I will believe all thy words. And thus he was caught with guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.24'>And Ammon began to speak unto him with boldness, and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.25'>And he answered, and said unto him: I do not know what that meaneth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.26'>And then Ammon said: Believest thou that there is a Great Spirit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.27'>And he said, Yea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.28'>And Ammon said: This is God. And Ammon said unto him again: Believest thou that this Great Spirit, who is God, created all things which are in heaven and in the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.29'>And he said: Yea, I believe that he created all things which are in the earth; but I do not know the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.30'>And Ammon said unto him: The heavens is a place where God dwells and all his holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.31'>And king Lamoni said: Is it above the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.32'>And Ammon said: Yea, and he looketh down upon all the children of men; and he knows all the thoughts and intents of the heart; for by his hand were they all created from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.33'>And king Lamoni said: I believe all these things which thou hast spoken. Art thou sent from God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.34'>Ammon said unto him: I am a man; and man in the beginning was created after the image of God, and I am called by his Holy Spirit to teach these things unto this people, that they may be brought to a knowledge of that which is just and true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.35'>And a portion of that Spirit dwelleth in me, which giveth me knowledge, and also power according to my faith and desires which are in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.36'>Now when Ammon had said these words, he began at the creation of the world, and also the creation of Adam, and told him all the things concerning the fall of man, and rehearsed and laid before him the records and the holy scriptures of the people, which had been spoken by the prophets, even down to the time that their father, Lehi, left Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.37'>And he also rehearsed unto them (for it was unto the king and to his servants) all the journeyings of their fathers in the wilderness, and all their sufferings with hunger and thirst, and their travail, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.38'>And he also rehearsed unto them concerning the rebellions of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, yea, all their rebellions did he relate unto them; and he expounded unto them all the records and scriptures from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem down to the present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.39'>But this is not all; for he expounded unto them the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world; and he also made known unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and all the works of the Lord did he make known unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.40'>And it came to pass that after he had said all these things, and expounded them to the king, that the king believed all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.41'>And he began to cry unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, have mercy; according to thy abundant mercy which thou hast had upon the people of Nephi, have upon me, and my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.42'>And now, when he had said this, he fell unto the earth, as if he were dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.18.43'>And it came to pass that his servants took him and carried him in unto his wife, and laid him upon a bed; and he lay as if he were dead for the space of two days and two nights; and his wife, and his sons, and his daughters mourned over him, after the manner of the Lamanites, greatly lamenting his loss.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.19'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.1'>AND it came to pass that after two days and two nights they were about to take his body and lay it in a sepulchre, which they had made for the purpose of burying their dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.2'>Now the queen having heard of the fame of Ammon, therefore she sent and desired that he should come in unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.3'>And it came to pass that Ammon did as he was commanded, and went in unto the queen, and desired to know what she would that he should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.4'>And she said unto him: The servants of my husband have made it known unto me that thou art a prophet of a holy God, and that thou hast power to do many mighty works in his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.5'>Therefore, if this is the case, I would that ye should go in and see my husband, for he has been laid upon his bed for the space of two days and two nights; and some say that he is not dead, but others say that he is dead and that he stinketh, and that he ought to be placed in the sepulchre; but as for myself, to me he doth not stink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.6'>Now, this was what Ammon desired, for he knew that king Lamoni was under the power of God; he knew that the dark veil of unbelief was being cast away from his mind, and the light which did light up his mind, which was the light of the glory of God, which was a marvelous light of his goodness-yea, this light had infused such joy into his soul, the cloud of darkness having been dispelled, and that the light of everlasting life was lit up in his soul, yea, he knew that this had overcome his natural frame, and he was carried away in God-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.7'>Therefore, what the queen desired of him was his only desire. Therefore, he went in to see the king according as the queen had desired him; and he saw the king, and he knew that he was not dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.8'>And he said unto the queen: He is not dead, but he sleepeth in God, and on the morrow he shall rise again; therefore bury him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.9'>And Ammon said unto her: Believest thou this? And she said unto him: I have had no witness save thy word, and the word of our servants; nevertheless I believe that it shall be according as thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.10'>And Ammon said unto her: Blessed art thou because of thy exceeding faith; I say unto thee, woman, there has not been such great faith among all the people of the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.11'>And it came to pass that she watched over the bed of her husband, from that time even until that time on the morrow which Ammon had appointed that he should rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.12'>And it came to pass that he arose, according to the words of Ammon; and as he arose, he stretched forth his hand unto the woman, and said: Blessed be the name of God, and blessed art thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.13'>For as sure as thou livest, behold, I have seen my Redeemer; and he shall come forth, and be born of a woman, and he shall redeem all mankind who believe on his name. Now, when he had said these words, his heart was swollen within him, and he sunk again with joy; and the queen also sunk down, being overpowered by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.14'>Now Ammon seeing the Spirit of the Lord poured out according to his prayers upon the Lamanites, his brethren, who had been the cause of so much mourning among the Nephites, or among all the people of God because of their iniquities and their traditions, he fell upon his knees, and began to pour out his soul in prayer and thanksgiving to God for what he had done for his brethren; and he was also overpowered with joy; and thus they all three had sunk to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.15'>Now, when the servants of the king had seen that they had fallen, they also began to cry unto God, for the fear of the Lord had come upon them also, for it was they who had stood before the king and testified unto him concerning the great power of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.16'>And it came to pass that they did call on the name of the Lord, in their might, even until they had all fallen to the earth, save it were one of the Lamanitish women, whose name was Abish, she having been converted unto the Lord for many years, on account of a remarkable vision of her father-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.17'>Thus, having been converted to the Lord, and never having made it known, therefore, when she saw that all the servants of Lamoni had fallen to the earth, and also her mistress, the queen, and the king, and Ammon lay prostrate upon the earth, she knew that it was the power of God; and supposing that this opportunity, by making known unto the people what had happened among them, that by beholding this scene it would cause them to believe in the power of God, therefore she ran forth from house to house, making it known unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.18'>And they began to assemble themselves together unto the house of the king. And there came a multitude, and to their astonishment, they beheld the king, and the queen, and their servants prostrate upon the earth, and they all lay there as though they were dead; and they also saw Ammon, and behold, he was a Nephite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.19'>And now the people began to murmur among themselves; some saying that it was a great evil that had come upon them, or upon the king and his house, because he had suffered that the Nephite should remain in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.20'>But others rebuked them, saying: The king hath brought this evil upon his house, because he slew his servants who had had their flocks scattered at the waters of Sebus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.21'>And they were also rebuked by those men who had stood at the waters of Sebus and scattered the flocks which belonged to the king, for they were angry with Ammon because of the number which he had slain of their brethren at the waters of Sebus, while defending the flocks of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.22'>Now, one of them, whose brother had been slain with the sword of Ammon, being exceedingly angry with Ammon, drew his sword and went forth that he might let it fall upon Ammon, to slay him; and as he lifted the sword to smite him, behold, he fell dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.23'>Now we see that Ammon could not be slain, for the Lord had said unto Mosiah, his father: I will spare him, and it shall be unto him according to thy faith-therefore, Mosiah trusted him unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.24'>And it came to pass that when the multitude beheld that the man had fallen dead, who lifted the sword to slay Ammon, fear came upon them all, and they durst not put forth their hands to touch him or any of those who had fallen; and they began to marvel again among themselves what could be the cause of this great power, or what all these things could mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.25'>And it came to pass that there were many among them who said that Ammon was the Great Spirit, and others said he was sent by the Great Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.26'>But others rebuked them all, saying that he was a monster, who had been sent from the Nephites to torment them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.27'>And there were some who said that Ammon was sent by the Great Spirit to afflict them because of their iniquities; and that it was the Great Spirit that had always attended the Nephites, who had ever delivered them out of their hands; and they said that it was this Great Spirit who had destroyed so many of their brethren, the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.28'>And thus the contention began to be exceedingly sharp among them. And while they were thus contending, the woman servant who had caused the multitude to be gathered together came, and when she saw the contention which was among the multitude she was exceedingly sorrowful, even unto tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.29'>And it came to pass that she went and took the queen by the hand, that perhaps she might raise her from the ground; and as soon as she touched her hand she arose and stood upon her feet, and cried with a loud voice, saying: O blessed Jesus, who has saved me from an awful hell! O blessed God, have mercy on this people!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.30'>And when she had said this, she clasped her hands, being filled with joy, speaking many words which were not understood; and when she had done this, she took the king, Lamoni, by the hand, and behold he arose and stood upon his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.31'>And he, immediately, seeing the contention among his people, went forth and began to rebuke them, and to teach them the words which he had heard from the mouth of Ammon; and as many as heard his words believed, and were converted unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.32'>But there were many among them who would not hear his words; therefore they went their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.33'>And it came to pass that when Ammon arose he also administered unto them, and also did all the servants of Lamoni; and they did all declare unto the people the selfsame thing-that their hearts had been changed; that they had no more desire to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.34'>And behold, many did declare unto the people that they had seen angels and had conversed with them; and thus they had told them things of God, and of his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.35'>And it came to pass that there were many that did believe in their words; and as many as did believe were baptized; and they became a righteous people, and they did establish a church among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.36'>And thus the work of the Lord did commence among the Lamanites; thus the Lord did begin to pour out his Spirit upon them; and we see that his arm is extended to all people who will repent and believe on his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.1'>AND it came to pass that when they had established a church in that land, that king Lamoni desired that Ammon should go with him to the land of Nephi, that he might show him unto his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And the voice of the Lord came to Ammon, saying: Thou shalt not go up to the land of Nephi, for behold, the king will seek thy life; but thou shalt go to the land of Middoni; for behold, thy brother Aaron, and also Muloki and Ammah are in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>Now it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he said unto Lamoni: Behold, my brother and brethren are in prison at Middoni, and I go that I may deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>Now Lamoni said unto Ammon: I know, in the strength of the Lord thou canst do all things. But behold, I will go with thee to the land of Middoni; for the king of the land of Middoni, whose name is Antiomno, is a friend unto me; therefore I go to the land of Middoni, that I may flatter the king of the land, and he will cast thy brethren out of prison. Now Lamoni said unto him: Who told thee that thy brethren were in prison?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>And Ammon said unto him: No one hath told me, save it be God; and he said unto me-Go and deliver thy brethren, for they are in prison in the land of Middoni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>Now when Lamoni had heard this he caused that his servants should make ready his horses and his chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.7'>And he said unto Ammon: Come, I will go with thee down to the land of Middoni, and there I will plead with the king that he will cast thy brethren out of prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.8'>And it came to pass that as Ammon and Lamoni were journeying thither, they met the father of Lamoni, who was king over all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.9'>And behold, the father of Lamoni said unto him: Why did ye not come to the feast on that great day when I made a feast unto my sons, and unto my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.10'>And he also said: Whither art thou going with this Nephite, who is one of the children of a liar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And it came to pass that Lamoni rehearsed unto him whither he was going, for he feared to offend him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>And he also told him all the cause of his tarrying in his own kingdom, that he did not go unto his father to the feast which he had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>And now when Lamoni had rehearsed unto him all these things, behold, to his astonishment, his father was angry with him, and said: Lamoni, thou art going to deliver these Nephites, who are sons of a liar. Behold, he robbed our fathers; and now his children are also come amongst us that they may, by their cunning and their lyings, deceive us, that they again may rob us of our property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>Now the father of Lamoni commanded him that he should slay Ammon with the sword. And he also commanded him that he should not go to the land of Middoni, but that he should return with him to the land of Ishmael.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.15'>But Lamoni said unto him: I will not slay Ammon, neither will I return to the land of Ishmael, but I go to the land of Middoni that I may release the brethren of Ammon, for I know that they are just men and holy prophets of the true God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.16'>Now when his father had heard these words, he was angry with him, and he drew his sword that he might smite him to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>But Ammon stood forth and said unto him: Behold, thou shalt not slay thy son; nevertheless, it were better that he should fall than thee, for behold, he has repented of his sins; but if thou shouldst fall at this time, in thine anger, thy soul could not be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>And again, it is expedient that thou shouldst forbear; for if thou shouldst slay thy son, he being an innocent man, his blood would cry from the ground to the Lord his God, for vengeance to come upon thee; and perhaps thou wouldst lose thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>Now when Ammon had said these words unto him, he answered him, saying: I know that if I should slay my son, that I should shed innocent blood; for it is thou that hast sought to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>And he stretched forth his hand to slay Ammon. But Ammon withstood his blows, and also smote his arm that he could not use it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>Now when the king saw that Ammon could slay him, he began to plead with Ammon that he would spare his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.22'>But Ammon raised his sword, and said unto him: Behold, I will smite thee except thou wilt grant unto me that my brethren may be cast out of prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.23'>Now the king, fearing he should lose his life, said: If thou wilt spare me I will grant unto thee whatsoever thou wilt ask, even to half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>Now when Ammon saw that he had wrought upon the old king according to his desire, he said unto him: If thou wilt grant that my brethren may be cast out of prison, and also that Lamoni may retain his kingdom, and that ye be not displeased with him, but grant that he may do according to his own desires in whatsoever thing he thinketh, then will I spare thee; otherwise I will smite thee to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>Now when Ammon had said these words, the king began to rejoice because of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>And when he saw that Ammon had no desire to destroy him, and when he also saw the great love he had for his son Lamoni, he was astonished exceedingly, and said: Because this is all that thou hast desired, that I would release thy brethren, and suffer that my son Lamoni should retain his kingdom, behold, I will grant unto you that my son may retain his kingdom from this time and forever; and I will govern him no more-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>And I will also grant unto thee that thy brethren may be cast out of prison, and thou and thy brethren may come unto me, in my kingdom; for I shall greatly desire to see thee. For the king was greatly astonished at the words which he had spoken, and also at the words which had been spoken by his son Lamoni, therefore he was desirous to learn them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni proceeded on their journey towards the land of Middoni. And Lamoni found favor in the eyes of the king of the land; therefore the brethren of Ammon were brought forth out of prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>And when Ammon did meet them he was exceedingly sorrowful, for behold they were naked, and their skins were worn exceedingly because of being bound with strong cords. And they also had suffered hunger, thirst, and all kinds of afflictions; nevertheless they were patient in all their sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>And, as it happened, it was their lot to have fallen into the hands of a more hardened and a more stiffnecked people; therefore they would not hearken unto their words, and they had cast them out, and had smitten them, and had driven them from house to house, and from place to place, even until they had arrived in the land of Middoni; and there they were taken and cast into prison, and bound with strong cords, and kept in prison for many days, and were delivered by Lamoni and Ammon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.1'>NOW when Ammon and his brethren separated themselves in the borders of the land of the Lamanites, behold Aaron took his journey towards the land which was called by the Lamanites, Jerusalem, calling it after the land of their fathers' nativity; and it was away joining the borders of Mormon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.2'>Now the Lamanites and the Amalekites and the people of Amulon had built a great city, which was called Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.3'>Now the Lamanites of themselves were sufficiently hardened, but the Amalekites and the Amulonites were still harder; therefore they did cause the Lamanites that they should harden their hearts, that they should wax strong in wickedness and their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.4'>And it came to pass that Aaron came to the city of Jerusalem, and first began to preach to the Amalekites. And he began to preach to them in their synagogues, for they had built synagogues after the order of the Nehors; for many of the Amalekites and the Amulonites were after the order of the Nehors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>Therefore, as Aaron entered into one of their synagogues to preach unto the people, and as he was speaking unto them, behold there arose an Amalekite and began to contend with him, saying: What is that thou hast testified? Hast thou seen an angel? Why do not angels appear unto us? Behold are not this people as good as thy people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>Thou also sayest, except we repent we shall perish. How knowest thou the thought and intent of our hearts? How knowest thou that we have cause to repent? How knowest thou that we are not a righteous people? Behold, we have built sanctuaries, and we do assemble ourselves together to worship God. We do believe that God will save all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>Now Aaron said unto him: Believest thou that the Son of God shall come to redeem mankind from their sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>And the man said unto him: We do not believe that thou knowest any such thing. We do not believe in these foolish traditions. We do not believe that thou knowest of things to come, neither do we believe that thy fathers and also that our fathers did know concerning the things which they spake, of that which is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.9'>Now Aaron began to open the scriptures unto them concerning the coming of Christ, and also concerning the resurrection of the dead, and that there could be no redemption for mankind save it were through the death and sufferings of Christ, and the atonement of his blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.10'>And it came to pass as he began to expound these things unto them they were angry with him, and began to mock him; and they would not hear the words which he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.11'>Therefore, when he saw that they would not hear his words, he departed out of their synagogue, and came over to a village which was called Ani-Anti, and there he found Muloki preaching the word unto them; and also Ammah and his brethren. And they contended with many about the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.12'>And it came to pass that they saw that the people would harden their hearts, therefore they departed and came over into the land of Middoni. And they did preach the word unto many, and few believed on the words which they taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.13'>Nevertheless, Aaron and a certain number of his brethren were taken and cast into prison, and the remainder of them fled out of the land of Middoni unto the regions round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.14'>And those who were cast into prison suffered many things, and they were delivered by the hand of Lamoni and Ammon, and they were fed and clothed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.15'>And they went forth again to declare the word, and thus they were delivered for the first time out of prison; and thus they had suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.16'>And they went forth whithersoever they were led by the Spirit of the Lord, preaching the word of God in every synagogue of the Amalekites, or in every assembly of the Lamanites where they could be admitted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.17'>And it came to pass that the Lord began to bless them, insomuch that they brought many to the knowledge of the truth; yea, they did convince many of their sins, and of the traditions of their fathers, which were not correct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.18'>And it came to pass that Ammon and Lamoni returned from the land of Middoni to the land of Ishmael, which was the land of their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.19'>And king Lamoni would not suffer that Ammon should serve him, or be his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.20'>But he caused that there should be synagogues built in the land of Ishmael; and he caused that his people, or the people who were under his reign, should assemble themselves together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.21'>And he did rejoice over them, and he did teach them many things. And he did also declare unto them that they were a people who were under him, and that they were a free people, that they were free from the oppressions of the king, his father; for that his father had granted unto him that he might reign over the people who were in the land of Ishmael, and in all the land round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.22'>And he also declared unto them that they might have the liberty of worshiping the Lord their God according to their desires, in whatsoever place they were in, if it were in the land which was under the reign of king Lamoni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.23'>And Ammon did preach unto the people of king Lamoni; and it came to pass that he did teach them all things concerning things pertaining to righteousness. And he did exhort them daily, with all diligence; and they gave heed unto his word, and they were zealous for keeping the commandments of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.1'>NOW, as Ammon was thus teaching the people of Lamoni continually, we will return to the account of Aaron and his brethren; for after he departed from the land of Middoni he was led by the Spirit to the land of Nephi, even to the house of the king which was over all the land save it were the land of Ishmael; and he was the father of Lamoni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.2'>And it came to pass that he went in unto him into the king's palace, with his brethren, and bowed himself before the king, and said unto him: Behold, O king, we are the brethren of Ammon, whom thou hast delivered out of prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.3'>And now, O king, if thou wilt spare our lives, we will be thy servants. And the king said unto them: Arise, for I will grant unto you your lives, and I will not suffer that ye shall be my servants; but I will insist that ye shall administer unto me; for I have been somewhat troubled in mind because of the generosity and the greatness of the words of thy brother Ammon; and I desire to know the cause why he has not come up out of Middoni with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.4'>And Aaron said unto the king: Behold, the Spirit of the Lord has called him another way; he has gone to the land of Ishmael, to teach the people of Lamoni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.5'>Now the king said unto them: What is this that ye have said concerning the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, this is the thing which doth trouble me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.6'>And also, what is this that Ammon said-If ye will repent ye shall be saved, and if ye will not repent, ye shall be cast off at the last day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.7'>And Aaron answered him and said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God? And the king said: I know that the Amalekites say that there is a God, and I have granted unto them that they should build sanctuaries, that they may assemble themselves together to worship him. And if now thou sayest there is a God, behold I will believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.8'>And now when Aaron heard this, his heart began to rejoice, and he said: Behold, assuredly as thou livest, O king, there is a God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.9'>And the king said: Is God that Great Spirit that brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.10'>And Aaron said unto him: Yea, he is that Great Spirit, and he created all things both in heaven and in earth. Believest thou this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.11'>And he said: Yea, I believe that the Great Spirit created all things, and I desire that ye should tell me concerning all these things, and I will believe thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.12'>And it came to pass that when Aaron saw that the king would believe his words, he began from the creation of Adam, reading the scriptures unto the king-how God created man after his own image, and that God gave him commandments, and that because of transgression, man had fallen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.13'>And Aaron did expound unto him the scriptures from the creation of Adam, laying the fall of man before him, and their carnal state and also the plan of redemption, which was prepared from the foundation of the world, through Christ, for all whosoever would believe on his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.14'>And since man had fallen he could not merit anything of himself; but the sufferings and death of Christ atone for their sins, through faith and repentance, and so forth; and that he breaketh the bands of death, that the grave shall have no victory, and that the sting of death should be swallowed up in the hopes of glory; and Aaron did expound all these things unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.15'>And it came to pass that after Aaron had expounded these things unto him, the king said: What shall I do that I may have this eternal life of which thou hast spoken? Yea, what shall I do that I may be born of God, having this wicked spirit rooted out of my breast, and receive his Spirit, that I may be filled with joy, that I may not be cast off at the last day? Behold, said he, I will give up all that I possess, yea, I will forsake my kingdom, that I may receive this great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.16'>But Aaron said unto him: If thou desirest this thing, if thou wilt bow down before God, yea, if thou wilt repent of all thy sins, and will bow down before God, and call on his name in faith, believing that ye shall receive, then shalt thou receive the hope which thou desirest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.17'>And it came to pass that when Aaron had said these words, the king did bow down before the Lord, upon his knees; yea, even he did prostrate himself upon the earth, and cried mightily, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.18'>O God, Aaron hath told me that there is a God; and if there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me, and I will give away all my sins to know thee, and that I may be raised from the dead, and be saved at the last day. And now when the king had said these words, he was struck as if he were dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.19'>And it came to pass that his servants ran and told the queen all that had happened unto the king. And she came in unto the king; and when she saw him lay as if he were dead, and also Aaron and his brethren standing as though they had been the cause of his fall, she was angry with them, and commanded that her servants, or the servants of the king, should take them and slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.20'>Now the servants had seen the cause of the king's fall, therefore they durst not lay their hands on Aaron and his brethren; and they pled with the queen saying: Why commandest thou that we should slay these men, when behold one of them is mightier than us all? Therefore we shall fall before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.21'>Now when the queen saw the fear of the servants she also began to fear exceedingly, lest there should some evil come upon her. And she commanded her servants that they should go and call the people, that they might slay Aaron and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.22'>Now when Aaron saw the determination of the queen, he, also knowing the hardness of the hearts of the people, feared lest that a multitude should assemble themselves together, and there should be a great contention and a disturbance among them; therefore he put forth his hand and raised the king from the earth, and said unto him: Stand. And he stood upon his feet, receiving his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.23'>Now this was done in the presence of the queen and many of the servants. And when they saw it they greatly marveled, and began to fear. And the king stood forth, and began to minister unto them. And he did minister unto them, insomuch that his whole household were converted unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.24'>Now there was a multitude gathered together because of the commandment of the queen, and there began to be great murmurings among them because of Aaron and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.25'>But the king stood forth among them and administered unto them. And they were pacified towards Aaron and those who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.26'>And it came to pass that when the king saw that the people were pacified, he caused that Aaron and his brethren should stand forth in the midst of the multitude, and that they should preach the word unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.27'>And it came to pass that the king sent a proclamation throughout all the land, amongst all his people who were in all his land, who were in all the regions round about, which was bordering even to the sea, on the east and on the west, and which was divided from the land of Zarahemla by a narrow strip of wilderness, which ran from the sea east even to the sea west, and round about on the borders of the seashore, and the borders of the wilderness which was on the north by the land of Zarahemla, through the borders of Manti, by the head of the river Sidon, running from the east towards the west-and thus were the Lamanites and the Nephites divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.28'>Now, the more idle part of the Lamanites lived in the wilderness, and dwelt in tents; and they were spread through the wilderness on the west, in the land of Nephi; yea, and also on the west of the land of Zarahemla, in the borders by the seashore, and on the west in the land of Nephi, in the place of their fathers' first inheritance, and thus bordering along by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.29'>And also there were many Lamanites on the east by the seashore, whither the Nephites had driven them. And thus the Nephites were nearly surrounded by the Lamanites; nevertheless the Nephites had taken possession of all the northern parts of the land bordering on the wilderness, at the head of the river Sidon, from the east to the west, round about on the wilderness side; on the north, even until they came to the land which they called Bountiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.30'>And it bordered upon the land which they called Desolation, it being so far northward that it came into the land which had been peopled and been destroyed, of whose bones we have spoken, which was discovered by the people of Zarahemla, it being the place of their first landing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.31'>And they came from there up into the south wilderness. Thus the land on the northward was called Desolation, and the land on the southward was called Bountiful, it being the wilderness which is filled with all manner of wild animals of every kind, a part of which had come from the land northward for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.32'>And now, it was only the distance of a day and a half's journey for a Nephite, on the line Bountiful and the land Desolation, from the east to the west sea; and thus the land of Nephi and the land of Zarahemla were nearly surrounded by water, there being a small neck of land between the land northward and the land southward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.33'>And it came to pass that the Nephites had inhabited the land Bountiful, even from the east unto the west sea, and thus the Nephites in their wisdom, with their guards and their armies, had hemmed in the Lamanites on the south, that thereby they should have no more possession on the north, that they might not overrun the land northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.34'>Therefore the Lamanites could have no more possessions only in the land of Nephi, and the wilderness round about. Now this was wisdom in the Nephites-as the Lamanites were an enemy to them, they would not suffer their afflictions on every hand, and also that they might have a country whither they might flee, according to their desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.35'>And now I, after having said this, return again to the account of Ammon and Aaron, Omner and Himni, and their brethren.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.1'>BEHOLD, now it came to pass that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation among all his people, that they should not lay their hands on Ammon, or Aaron, or Omner, or Himni, nor either of their brethren who should go forth preaching the word of God, in whatsoever place they should be, in any part of their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.2'>Yea, he sent a decree among them, that they should not lay their hands on them to bind them, or to cast them into prison; neither should they spit upon them, nor smite them, nor cast them out of their synagogues, nor scourge them; neither should they cast stones at them, but that they should have free access to their houses, and also their temples, and their sanctuaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.3'>And thus they might go forth and preach the word according to their desires, for the king had been converted unto the Lord, and all his household; therefore he sent his proclamation throughout the land unto his people, that the word of God might have no obstruction, but that it might go forth throughout all the land, that his people might be convinced concerning the wicked traditions of their fathers, and that they might be convinced that they were all brethren, and that they ought not to murder, nor to plunder, nor to steal, nor to commit adultery, nor to commit any manner of wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.4'>And now it came to pass that when the king had sent forth this proclamation, that Aaron and his brethren went forth from city to city, and from one house of worship to another, establishing churches, and consecrating priests and teachers throughout the land among the Lamanites, to preach and to teach the word of God among them; and thus they began to have great success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.5'>And thousands were brought to the knowledge of the Lord, yea, thousands were brought to believe in the traditions of the Nephites; and they were taught the records and prophecies which were handed down even to the present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.6'>And as sure as the Lord liveth, so sure as many as believed, or as many as were brought to the knowledge of the truth, through the preaching of Ammon and his brethren, according to the spirit of revelation and of prophecy, and the power of God working miracles in them-yea, I say unto you, as the Lord liveth, as many of the Lamanites as believed in their preaching, and were converted unto the Lord, never did fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.7'>For they became a righteous people; they did lay down the weapons of their rebellion, that they did not fight against God any more, neither against any of their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.8'>Now, these are they who were converted unto the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.9'>The people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Ishmael;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.10'>And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Middoni;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.11'>And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the city of Nephi;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.12'>And also of the people of the Lamanites who were in the land of Shilom, and who were in the land of Shemlon, and in the city of Lemuel, and in the city of Shimnilom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.13'>And these are the names of the cities of the Lamanites which were converted unto the Lord; and these are they that laid down the weapons of their rebellion, yea, all their weapons of war; and they were all Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.14'>And the Amalekites were not converted, save only one; neither were any of the Amulonites; but they did harden their hearts, and also the hearts of the Lamanites in that part of the land wheresoever they dwelt, yea, and all their villages and all their cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.15'>Therefore, we have named all the cities of the Lamanites in which they did repent and come to the knowledge of the truth, and were converted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.16'>And now it came to pass that the king and those who were converted were desirous that they might have a name, that thereby they might be distinguished from their brethren; therefore the king consulted with Aaron and many of their priests, concerning the name that they should take upon them, that they might be distinguished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.17'>And it came to pass that they called their names Anti-Nephi-Lehies; and they were called by this name and were no more called Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.23.18'>And they began to be a very industrious people; yea, and they were friendly with the Nephites; therefore, they did open a correspondence with them, and the curse of God did no more follow them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.1'>AND it came to pass that the Amalekites and the Amulonites and the Lamanites who were in the land of Amulon, and also in the land of Helam, and who were in the land of Jerusalem, and in fine, in all the land round about, who had not been converted and had not taken upon them the name of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, were stirred up by the Amalekites and by the Amulonites to anger against their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.2'>And their hatred became exceedingly sore against them, even insomuch that they began to rebel against their king, insomuch that they would not that he should be their king; therefore, they took up arms against the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.3'>Now the king conferred the kingdom upon his son, and he called his name Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.4'>And the king died in that selfsame year that the Lamanites began to make preparations for war against the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.5'>Now when Ammon and his brethren and all those who had come up with him saw the preparations of the Lamanites to destroy their brethren, they came forth to the land of Midian, and there Ammon met all his brethren; and from thence they came to the land of Ishmael that they might hold a council with Lamoni and also with his brother Anti-Nephi-Lehi, what they should do to defend themselves against the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.6'>Now there was not one soul among all the people who had been converted unto the Lord that would take up arms against their brethren; nay, they would not even make any preparations for war; yea, and also their king commanded them that they should not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.7'>Now, these are the words which he said unto the people concerning the matter: I thank my God, my beloved people, that our great God has in goodness sent these our brethren, the Nephites, unto us to preach unto us, and to convince us of the traditions of our wicked fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.8'>And behold, I thank my great God that he has given us a portion of his Spirit to soften our hearts, that we have opened a correspondence with these brethren, the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.9'>And behold, I also thank my God, that by opening this correspondence we have been convinced of our sins, and of the many murders which we have committed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.10'>And I also thank my God, yea, my great God, that he hath granted unto us that we might repent of these things, and also that he hath forgiven us of those our many sins and murders which we have committed, and taken away the guilt from our hearts, through the merits of his Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.11'>And now behold, my brethren, since it has been all that we could do, (as we were the most lost of all mankind) to repent of all our sins and the many murders which we have committed, and to get God to take them away from our hearts, for it was all we could do to repent sufficiently before God that he would take away our stain-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.12'>Now, my best beloved brethren, since God hath taken away our stains, and our swords have become bright, then let us stain our swords no more with the blood of our brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.13'>Behold, I say unto you, Nay, let us retain our swords that they be not stained with the blood of our brethren; for perhaps, if we should stain our swords again they can no more be washed bright through the blood of the Son of our great God, which shall be shed for the atonement of our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.14'>And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish; yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.15'>Oh, how merciful is our God! And now behold, since it has been as much as we could do to get our stains taken away from us, and our swords are made bright, let us hide them away that they may be kept bright, as a testimony to our God at the last day, or at the day that we shall be brought to stand before him to be judged, that we have not stained our swords in the blood of our brethren since he imparted his word unto us and has made us clean thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.16'>And now, my brethren, if our brethren seek to destroy us, behold, we will hide away our swords, yea, even we will bury them deep in the earth, that they may be kept bright, as a testimony that we have never used them, at the last day; and if our brethren destroy us, behold, we shall go to our God and shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.17'>And now it came to pass that when the king had made an end of these sayings, and all the people were assembled together, they took their swords, and all the weapons which were used for the shedding of man's blood, and they did bury them up deep in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.18'>And this they did, it being in their view a testimony to God, and also to men, that they never would use weapons again for the shedding of man's blood; and this they did, vouching and covenanting with God, that rather than shed the blood of their brethren they would give up their own lives; and rather than take away from a brother they would give unto him; and rather than spend their days in idleness they would labor abundantly with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.19'>And thus we see that, when these Lamanites were brought to believe and to know the truth, they were firm, and would suffer even unto death rather than commit sin; and thus we see that they buried their weapons of peace, or they buried the weapons of war, for peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.20'>And it came to pass that their brethren, the Lamanites, made preparations for war, and came up to the land of Nephi for the purpose of destroying the king, and to place another in his stead, and also of destroying the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.21'>Now when the people saw that they were coming against them they went out to meet them, and prostrated themselves before them to the earth, and began to call on the name of the Lord; and thus they were in this attitude when the Lamanites began to fall upon them, and began to slay them with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.22'>And thus without meeting any resistance, they did slay a thousand and five of them; and we know that they are blessed, for they have gone to dwell with their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.23'>Now when the Lamanites saw that their brethren would not flee from the sword, neither would they turn aside to the right hand or to the left, but that they would lie down and perish, and praised God even in the very act of perishing under the sword-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.24'>Now when the Lamanites saw this they did forbear from slaying them; and there were many whose hearts had swollen in them for those of their brethren who had fallen under the sword, for they repented of the things which they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.25'>And it came to pass that they threw down their weapons of war, and they would not take them again, for they were stung for the murders which they had committed; and they came down even as their brethren, relying upon the mercies of those whose arms were lifted to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.26'>And it came to pass that the people of God were joined that day by more than the number who had been slain; and those who had been slain were righteous people, therefore we have no reason to doubt but what they were saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.27'>And there was not a wicked man slain among them; but there were more than a thousand brought to the knowledge of the truth; thus we see that the Lord worketh in many ways to the salvation of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.28'>Now the greatest number of those of the Lamanites who slew so many of their brethren were Amalekites and Amulonites, the greatest number of whom were after the order of the Nehors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.29'>Now, among those who joined the people of the Lord, there were none who were Amalekites or Amulonites, or who were of the order of Nehor, but they were actual descendants of Laman and Lemuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.30'>And thus we can plainly discern, that after a people have been once enlightened by the Spirit of God, and have had great knowledge of things pertaining to righteousness, and then have fallen away into sin and transgression, they become more hardened, and thus their state becomes worse than though they had never known these things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.9'>And behold they are hunted at this day by the Lamanites. Thus the words of Abinadi were brought to pass, which he said concerning the seed of the priests who caused that he should suffer death by fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.13'>And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that they could not overpower the Nephites they returned again to their own land; and many of them came over to dwell in the land of Ishmael and the land of Nephi, and did join themselves to the people of God, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.14'>And they did also bury their weapons of war, according as their brethren had, and they began to be a righteous people; and they did walk in the ways of the Lord, and did observe to keep his commandments and his statutes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.22'>Yea, he that repenteth and exerciseth faith, and bringeth forth good works, and prayeth continually without ceasing-unto such it is given to know the mysteries of God; yea, unto such it shall be given to reveal things which never have been revealed; yea, and it shall be given unto such to bring thousands of souls to repentance, even as it has been given unto us to bring these our brethren to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.23'>Now do ye remember, my brethren, that we said unto our brethren in the land of Zarahemla, we go up to the land of Nephi, to preach unto our brethren, the Lamanites, and they laughed us to scorn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.24'>For they said unto us: Do ye suppose that ye can bring the Lamanites to the knowledge of the truth? Do ye suppose that ye can convince the Lamanites of the incorrectness of the traditions of their fathers, as stiffnecked a people as they are; whose hearts delight in the shedding of blood; whose days have been spent in the grossest iniquity; whose ways have been the ways of a transgressor from the beginning? Now my brethren, ye remember that this was their language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.25'>And moreover they did say: Let us take up arms against them, that we destroy them and their iniquity out of the land, lest they overrun us and destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.26'>But behold, my beloved brethren, we came into the wilderness not with the intent to destroy our brethren, but with the intent that perhaps we might save some few of their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.27'>Now when our hearts were depressed, and we were about to turn back, behold, the Lord comforted us, and said: Go amongst thy brethren, the Lamanites, and bear with patience thine afflictions, and I will give unto you success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.28'>And now behold, we have come, and been forth amongst them; and we have been patient in our sufferings, and we have suffered every privation; yea, we have traveled from house to house, relying upon the mercies of the world-not upon the mercies of the world alone but upon the mercies of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.29'>And we have entered into their houses and taught them, and we have taught them in their streets; yea, and we have taught them upon their hills; and we have also entered into their temples and their synagogues and taught them; and we have been cast out, and mocked, and spit upon, and smote upon our cheeks; and we have been stoned, and taken and bound with strong cords, and cast into prison; and through the power and wisdom of God we have been delivered again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.30'>And we have suffered all manner of afflictions, and all this, that perhaps we might be the means of saving some soul; and we supposed that our joy would be full if perhaps we could be the means of saving some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.31'>Now behold, we can look forth and see the fruits of our labors; and are they few? I say unto you, Nay, they are many; yea, and we can witness of their sincerity, because of their love towards their brethren and also towards us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.32'>For behold, they had rather sacrifice their lives than even to take the life of their enemy; and they have buried their weapons of war deep in the earth, because of their love towards their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.33'>And now behold I say unto you, has there been so great love in all the land? Behold, I say unto you, Nay, there has not, even among the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.34'>For behold, they would take up arms against their brethren; they would not suffer themselves to be slain. But behold how many of these have laid down their lives; and we know that they have gone to their God, because of their love and of their hatred to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.35'>Now have we not reason to rejoice? Yea, I say unto you, there never were men that had so great reason to rejoice as we, since the world began; yea, and my joy is carried away, even unto boasting in my God; for he has all power, all wisdom, and all understanding; he comprehendeth all things, and he is a merciful Being, even unto salvation, to those who will repent and believe on his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.36'>Now if this is boasting, even so will I boast; for this is my life and my light, my joy and my salvation, and my redemption from everlasting wo. Yea, blessed is the name of my God, who has been mindful of this people, who are a branch of the tree of Israel, and has been lost from its body in a strange land; yea, I say, blessed be the name of my God, who has been mindful of us, wanderers in a strange land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.37'>Now my brethren, we see that God is mindful of every people, whatsoever land they may be in; yea, he numbereth his people, and his bowels of mercy are over all the earth. Now this is my joy, and my great thanksgiving; yea, and I will give thanks unto my God forever. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.27'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.1'>NOW it came to pass that when those Lamanites who had gone to war against the Nephites had found, after their many struggles to destroy them, that it was in vain to seek their destruction, they returned again to the land of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.2'>And it came to pass that the Amalekites, because of their loss, were exceedingly angry. And when they saw that they could not seek revenge from the Nephites, they began to stir up the people in anger against their brethren, the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi; therefore they began again to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.3'>Now this people again refused to take their arms, and they suffered themselves to be slain according to the desires of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.4'>Now when Ammon and his brethren saw this work of destruction among those whom they so dearly beloved, and among those who had so dearly beloved them-for they were treated as though they were angels sent from God to save them from everlasting destruction-therefore, when Ammon and his brethren saw this great work of destruction, they were moved with compassion, and they said unto the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.5'>Let us gather together this people of the Lord, and let us go down to the land of Zarahemla to our brethren the Nephites, and flee out of the hands of our enemies, that we be not destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.6'>But the king said unto them: Behold, the Nephites will destroy us, because of the many murders and sins we have committed against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.7'>And Ammon said: I will go and inquire of the Lord, and if he say unto us, go down unto our brethren, will ye go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.8'>And the king said unto him: Yea, if the Lord saith unto us go, we will go down unto our brethren, and we will be their slaves until we repair unto them the many murders and sins which we have committed against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.9'>But Ammon said unto him: It is against the law of our brethren, which was established by my father, that there should be any slaves among them; therefore let us go down and rely upon the mercies of our brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.10'>But the king said unto him: Inquire of the Lord, and if he saith unto us go, we will go; otherwise we will perish in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.11'>And it came to pass that Ammon went and inquired of the Lord, and the Lord said unto him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.12'>Get this people out of this land, that they perish not; for Satan has great hold on the hearts of the Amalekites, who do stir up the Lamanites to anger against their brethren to slay them; therefore get thee out of this land; and blessed are this people in this generation, for I will preserve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.13'>And now it came to pass that Ammon went and told the king all the words which the Lord had said unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.14'>And they gathered together all their people, yea, all the people of the Lord, and did gather together all their flocks and herds, and departed out of the land, and came into the wilderness which divided the land of Nephi from the land of Zarahemla, and came over near the borders of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.15'>And it came to pass that Ammon said unto them: Behold, I and my brethren will go forth into the land of Zarahemla, and ye shall remain here until we return; and we will try the hearts of our brethren, whether they will that ye shall come into their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.16'>And it came to pass that as Ammon was going forth into the land, that he and his brethren met Alma, over in the place of which has been spoken; and behold, this was a joyful meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.17'>Now the joy of Ammon was so great even that he was full; yea, he was swallowed up in the joy of his God, even to the exhausting of his strength; and he fell again to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.18'>Now was not this exceeding joy? Behold, this is joy which none receiveth save it be the truly penitent and humble seeker of happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.19'>Now the joy of Alma in meeting his brethren was truly great, and also the joy of Aaron, of Omner, and Himni; but behold their joy was not that to exceed their strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.20'>And now it came to pass that Alma conducted his brethren back to the land of Zarahemla; even to his own house. And they went and told the chief judge all the things that had happened unto them in the land of Nephi, among their brethren, the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.21'>And it came to pass that the chief judge sent a proclamation throughout all the land, desiring the voice of the people concerning the admitting their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.22'>And it came to pass that the voice of the people came, saying: Behold, we will give up the land of Jershon, which is on the east by the sea, which joins the land Bountiful, which is on the south of the land Bountiful; and this land Jershon is the land which we will give unto our brethren for an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.23'>And behold, we will set our armies between the land Jershon and the land Nephi, that we may protect our brethren in the land Jershon; and this we do for our brethren, on account of their fear to take up arms against their brethren lest they should commit sin; and this their great fear came because of their sore repentance which they had, on account of their many murders and their awful wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.24'>And now behold, this will we do unto our brethren, that they may inherit the land Jershon; and we will guard them from their enemies with our armies, on condition that they will give us a portion of their substance to assist us that we may maintain our armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.25'>Now, it came to pass that when Ammon had heard this, he returned to the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, and also Alma with him, into the wilderness, where they had pitched their tents, and made known unto them all these things. And Alma also related unto them his conversion, with Ammon and Aaron, and his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.26'>And it came to pass that it did cause great joy among them. And they went down into the land of Jershon, and took possession of the land of Jershon; and they were called by the Nephites the people of Ammon; therefore they were distinguished by that name ever after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.27'>And they were among the people of Nephi, and also numbered among the people who were of the church of God. And they were also distinguished for their zeal towards God, and also towards men; for they were perfectly honest and upright in all things; and they were firm in the faith of Christ, even unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.28'>And they did look upon shedding the blood of their brethren with the greatest abhorrence; and they never could be prevailed upon to take up arms against their brethren; and they never did look upon death with any degree of terror, for their hope and views of Christ and the resurrection; therefore, death was swallowed up to them by the victory of Christ over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.29'>Therefore, they would suffer death in the most aggravating and distressing manner which could be inflicted by their brethren, before they would take the sword or cimeter to smite them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.30'>And thus they were a zealous and beloved people, a highly favored people of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.28'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.1'>AND now it came to pass that after the people of Ammon were established in the land of Jershon, and a church also established in the land of Jershon, and the armies of the Nephites were set round about the land of Jershon, yea, in all the borders round about the land of Zarahemla; behold the armies of the Lamanites had followed their brethren into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.2'>And thus there was a tremendous battle; yea, even such an one as never had been known among all the people in the land from the time Lehi left Jerusalem; yea, and tens of thousands of the Lamanites were slain and scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.3'>Yea, and also there was a tremendous slaughter among the people of Nephi; nevertheless, the Lamanites were driven and scattered, and the people of Nephi returned again to their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.4'>And now this was a time that there was a great mourning and lamentation heard throughout all the land, among all the people of Nephi-</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.8'>And this is the account of Ammon and his brethren, their journeyings in the land of Nephi, their sufferings in the land, their sorrows, and their afflictions, and their incomprehensible joy, and the reception and safety of the brethren in the land of Jershon. And now may the Lord, the Redeemer of all men, bless their souls forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.9'>And this is the account of the wars and contentions among the Nephites, and also the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites; *and the fifteenth year of the reign of the judges is ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.10'>And from the first year to the fifteenth has brought to pass the destruction of many thousand lives; yea, it has brought to pass an awful scene of bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.11'>And the bodies of many thousands are laid low in the earth, while the bodies of many thousands are moldering in heaps upon the face of the earth; yea, and many thousands are mourning for the loss of their kindred, because they have reason to fear, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are consigned to a state of endless wo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.12'>While many thousands of others truly mourn for the loss of their kindred, yet they rejoice and exult in the hope, and even know, according to the promises of the Lord, that they are raised to dwell at the right hand of God, in a state of never-ending happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.13'>And thus we see how great the inequality of man is because of sin and transgression, and the power of the devil, which comes by the cunning plans which he hath devised to ensnare the hearts of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.14'>And thus we see the great call of diligence of men to labor in the vineyards of the Lord; and thus we see the great reason of sorrow, and also of rejoicing-sorrow because of death and destruction among men, and joy because of the light of Christ unto life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>Yea, and the people did observe to keep the commandments of the Lord; and they were strict in observing the ordinances of God, according to the law of Moses; for they were taught to keep the law of Moses until it should be fulfilled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>Now there was no law against a man's belief; for it was strictly contrary to the commands of God that there should be a law which should bring men on to unequal grounds.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.17'>And many more such things did he say unto them, telling them that there could be no atonement made for the sins of men, but every man fared in this life according to the management of the creature; therefore every man prospered according to his genius, and that every man conquered according to his strength; and whatsoever a man did was no crime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.18'>And thus he did preach unto them, leading away the hearts of many, causing them to lift up their heads in their wickedness, yea, leading away many women, and also men, to commit whoredoms-telling them that when a man was dead, that was the end thereof.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.27'>And thus ye lead away this people after the foolish traditions of your fathers, and according to your own desires; and ye keep them down, even as it were in bondage, that ye may glut yourselves with the labors of their hands, that they durst not look up with boldness, and that they durst not enjoy their rights and privileges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.28'>Yea, they durst not make use of that which is their own lest they should offend their priests, who do yoke them according to their desires, and have brought them to believe, by their traditions and their dreams and their whims and their visions and their pretended mysteries, that they should, if they did not do according to their words, offend some unknown being, who they say is God-a being who never has been seen or known, who never was nor ever will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.29'>Now when the high priest and the chief judge saw the hardness of his heart, yea, when they saw that he would revile even against God, they would not make any reply to his words; but they caused that he should be bound; and they delivered him up into the hands of the officers, and sent him to the land of Zarahemla, that he might be brought before Alma, and the chief judge who was governor over all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.30'>And it came to pass that when he was brought before Alma and the chief judge, he did go on in the same manner as he did in the land of Gideon; yea, he went on to blaspheme.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.31'>And he did rise up in great swelling words before Alma, and did revile against the priests and teachers, accusing them of leading away the people after the silly traditions of their fathers, for the sake of glutting on the labors of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.32'>Now Alma said unto him: Thou knowest that we do not glut ourselves upon the labors of this people; for behold I have labored even from the commencement of the reign of the judges until now, with mine own hands for my support, notwithstanding my many travels round about the land to declare the word of God unto my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.33'>And notwithstanding the many labors which I have performed in the church, I have never received so much as even one senine for my labor; neither has any of my brethren, save it were in the judgment-seat; and then we have received only according to law for our time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.34'>And now, if we do not receive anything for our labors in the church, what doth it profit us to labor in the church save it were to declare the truth, that we may have rejoicings in the joy of our brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.35'>Then why sayest thou that we preach unto this people to get gain, when thou, of thyself, knowest that we receive no gain? And now, believest thou that we deceive this people, that causes such joy in their hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.36'>And Korihor answered him, Yea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.37'>And then Alma said unto him: Believest thou that there is a God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.38'>And he answered, Nay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.39'>Now Alma said unto him: Will ye deny again that there is a God, and also deny the Christ? For behold, I say unto you, I know there is a God, and also that Christ shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.40'>And now what evidence have ye that there is no God, or that Christ cometh not? I say unto you that ye have none, save it be your word only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.41'>But, behold, I have all things as a testimony that these things are true; and ye also have all things as a testimony unto you that they are true; and will ye deny them? Believest thou that these things are true?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.42'>Behold, I know that thou believest, but thou art possessed with a lying spirit, and ye have put off the Spirit of God that it may have no place in you; but the devil has power over you, and he doth carry you about, working devices that he may destroy the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.43'>And now Korihor said unto Alma: If thou wilt show me a sign, that I may be convinced that there is a God, yea, show unto me that he hath power, and then will I be convinced of the truth of thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.44'>But Alma said unto him: Thou hast had signs enough; will ye tempt your God? Will ye say, Show unto me a sign, when ye have the testimony of all these thy brethren, and also all the holy prophets? The scriptures are laid before thee, yea, and all things denote there is a God; yea, even the earth, and all things that are upon the face of it, yea, and its motion, yea, and also all the planets which move in their regular form do witness that there is a Supreme Creator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.45'>And yet do ye go about, leading away the hearts of this people, testifying unto them there is no God? And yet will ye deny against all these witnesses? And he said: Yea, I will deny, except ye shall show me a sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.46'>And now it came to pass that Alma said unto him: Behold, I am grieved because of the hardness of your heart, yea, that ye will still resist the spirit of the truth, that thy soul may be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.47'>But behold, it is better that thy soul should be lost than that thou shouldst be the means of bringing many souls down to destruction, by thy lying and by thy flattering words; therefore if thou shalt deny again, behold God shall smite thee, that thou shalt become dumb, that thou shalt never open thy mouth any more, that thou shalt not deceive this people any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.48'>Now Korihor said unto him: I do not deny the existence of a God, but I do not believe that there is a God; and I say also, that ye do not know that there is a God; and except ye show me a sign, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.49'>Now Alma said unto him: This will I give unto thee for a sign, that thou shalt be struck dumb, according to my words; and I say, that in the name of God, ye shall be struck dumb, that ye shall no more have utterance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.50'>Now when Alma had said these words, Korihor was struck dumb, that he could not have utterance, according to the words of Alma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.51'>And now when the chief judge saw this, he put forth his hand and wrote unto Korihor, saying: Art thou convinced of the power of God? In whom did ye desire that Alma should show forth his sign? Would ye that he should afflict others, to show unto thee a sign? Behold, he has showed unto you a sign; and now will ye dispute more?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.52'>And Korihor put forth his hand and wrote, saying: I know that I am dumb, for I cannot speak; and I know that nothing save it were the power of God could bring this upon me; yea, and I always knew that there was a God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.53'>But behold, the devil hath deceived me; for he appeared unto me in the form of an angel, and said unto me: Go and reclaim this people, for they have all gone astray after an unknown God. And he said unto me: There is no God; yea, and he taught me that which I should say. And I have taught his words; and I taught them because they were pleasing unto the carnal mind; and I taught them, even until I had much success, insomuch that I verily believed that they were true; and for this cause I withstood the truth, even until I have brought this great curse upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.54'>Now when he had said this, he besought that Alma should pray unto God, that the curse might be taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.55'>But Alma said unto him: If this curse should be taken from thee thou wouldst again lead away the hearts of this people; therefore, it shall be unto thee even as the Lord will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.56'>And it came to pass that the curse was not taken off of Korihor; but he was cast out, and went about from house to house begging for his food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.57'>Now the knowledge of what had happened unto Korihor was immediately published throughout all the land; yea, the proclamation was sent forth by the chief judge to all the people in the land, declaring unto those who had believed in the words of Korihor that they must speedily repent, lest the same judgments would come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.58'>And it came to pass that they were all convinced of the wickedness of Korihor; therefore they were all converted again unto the Lord; and this put an end to the iniquity after the manner of Korihor. And Korihor did go about from house to house, begging food for his support.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.59'>And it came to pass that as he went forth among the people, yea, among a people who had separated themselves from the Nephites and called themselves Zoramites, being led by a man whose name was Zoram-and as he went forth amongst them, behold, he was run upon and trodden down, even until he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.60'>And thus we see the end of him who perverteth the ways of the Lord; and thus we see that the devil will not support his children at the last day, but doth speedily drag them down to hell.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.31'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.1'>NOW it came to pass that after the end of Korihor, Alma having received tidings that the Zoramites were perverting the ways of the Lord, and that Zoram, who was their leader, was leading the hearts of the people to bow down to dumb idols, his heart again began to sicken because of the iniquity of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.2'>For it was the cause of great sorrow to Alma to know of iniquity among his people; therefore his heart was exceedingly sorrowful because of the separation of the Zoramites from the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.3'>Now the Zoramites had gathered themselves together in a land which they called Antionum, which was east of the land of Zarahemla, which lay nearly bordering upon the seashore, which was south of the land of Jershon, which also bordered upon the wilderness south, which wilderness was full of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.4'>Now the Nephites greatly feared that the Zoramites would enter into a correspondence with the Lamanites, and that it would be the means of great loss on the part of the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.5'>And now, as the preaching of the word had a great tendency to lead the people to do that which was just-yea, it had had more powerful effect upon the minds of the people than the sword, or anything else, which had happened unto them-therefore Alma thought it was expedient that they should try the virtue of the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.6'>Therefore he took Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner; and Himni he did leave in the church in Zarahemla; but the former three he took with him, and also Amulek and Zeezrom, who were at Melek; and he also took two of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.7'>Now the eldest of his sons he took not with him, and his name was Helaman; but the names of those whom he took with him were Shiblon and Corianton; and these are the names of those who went with him among the Zoramites, to preach unto them the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.8'>Now the Zoramites were dissenters from the Nephites; therefore they had had the word of God preached unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.9'>But they had fallen into great errors, for they would not observe to keep the commandments of God, and his statutes, according to the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.10'>Neither would they observe the performances of the church, to continue in prayer and supplication to God daily, that they might not enter into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.11'>Yea, in fine, they did pervert the ways of the Lord in very many instances; therefore, for this cause, Alma and his brethren went into the land to preach the word unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.12'>Now, when they had come into the land, behold, to their astonishment they found that the Zoramites had built synagogues, and that they did gather themselves together on one day of the week, which day they did call the day of the Lord; and they did worship after a manner which Alma and his brethren had never beheld;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.13'>For they had a place built up in the center of their synagogue, a place for standing, which was high above the head; and the top thereof would only admit one person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.14'>Therefore, whosoever desired to worship must go forth and stand upon the top thereof, and stretch forth his hands towards heaven, and cry with a loud voice, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.15'>Holy, holy God; we believe that thou art God, and we believe that thou art holy, and that thou wast a spirit, and that thou art a spirit, and that thou wilt be a spirit forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.16'>Holy God, we believe that thou hast separated us from our brethren; and we do not believe in the tradition of our brethren, which was handed down to them by the childishness of their fathers; but we believe that thou hast elected us to be thy holy children; and also thou hast made it known unto us that there shall be no Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.17'>But thou art the same yesterday, today, and forever; and thou hast elected us that we shall be saved, whilst all around us are elected to be cast by thy wrath down to hell; for the which holiness, O God, we thank thee; and we also thank thee that thou hast elected us, that we may not be led away after the foolish traditions of our brethren, which doth bind them down to a belief of Christ, which doth lead their hearts to wander far from thee, our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.18'>And again we thank thee, O God, that we are a chosen and a holy people. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.19'>Now it came to pass that after Alma and his brethren and his sons had heard these prayers, they were astonished beyond all measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.20'>For behold, every man did go forth and offer up these same prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.21'>Now the place was called by them Rameumptom, which, being interpreted, is the holy stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.22'>Now, from this stand they did offer up, every man, the selfsame prayer unto God, thanking their God that they were chosen of him, and that he did not lead them away after the tradition of their brethren, and that their hearts were not stolen away to believe in things to come, which they knew nothing about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.23'>Now, after the people had all offered up thanks after this manner, they returned to their homes, never speaking of their God again until they had assembled themselves together again to the holy stand, to offer up thanks after their manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.24'>Now when Alma saw this his heart was grieved; for he saw that they were a wicked and a perverse people; yea, he saw that their hearts were set upon gold, and upon silver, and upon all manner of fine goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.25'>Yea, and he also saw that their hearts were lifted up unto great boasting, in their pride.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.26'>And he lifted up his voice to heaven, and cried, saying: O, how long, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that thy servants shall dwell here below in the flesh, to behold such gross wickedness among the children of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.27'>Behold, O God, they cry unto thee, and yet their hearts are swallowed up in their pride. Behold, O God, they cry unto thee with their mouths, while they are puffed up, even to greatness, with the vain things of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.28'>Behold, O my God, their costly apparel, and their ringlets, and their bracelets, and their ornaments of gold, and all their precious things which they are ornamented with; and behold, their hearts are set upon them, and yet they cry unto thee and say-We thank thee, O God, for we are a chosen people unto thee, while others shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.29'>Yea, and they say that thou hast made it known unto them that there shall be no Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.30'>O Lord God, how long wilt thou suffer that such wickedness and infidelity shall be among this people? O Lord, wilt thou give me strength, that I may bear with mine infirmities. For I am infirm, and such wickedness among this people doth pain my soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.31'>O Lord, my heart is exceedingly sorrowful; wilt thou comfort my soul in Christ. O Lord, wilt thou grant unto me that I may have strength, that I may suffer with patience these afflictions which shall come upon me, because of the iniquity of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.32'>O Lord, wilt thou comfort my soul, and give unto me success, and also my fellow laborers who are with me-yea, Ammon, and Aaron, and Omner, and also Amulek and Zeezrom and also my two sons-yea, even all these wilt thou comfort, O Lord. Yea, wilt thou comfort their souls in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.33'>Wilt thou grant unto them that they may have strength, that they may bear their afflictions which shall come upon them because of the iniquities of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.34'>O Lord, wilt thou grant unto us that we may have success in bringing them again unto thee in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.35'>Behold, O Lord, their souls are precious, and many of them are our brethren; therefore, give unto us, O Lord, power and wisdom that we may bring these, our brethren, again unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.36'>Now it came to pass that when Alma had said these words, that he clapped his hands upon all them who were with him. And behold, as he clapped his hands upon them, they were filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.37'>And after that they did separate themselves one from another, taking no thought for themselves what they should eat, or what they should drink, or what they should put on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.38'>And the Lord provided for them that they should hunger not, neither should they thirst; yea, and he also gave them strength, that they should suffer no manner of afflictions, save it were swallowed up in the joy of Christ. Now this was according to the prayer of Alma; and this because he prayed in faith.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.32'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.1'>AND it came to pass that they did go forth, and began to preach the word of God unto the people, entering into their synagogues, and into their houses; yea, and even they did preach the word in their streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.2'>And it came to pass that after much labor among them, they began to have success among the poor class of people; for behold, they were cast out of the synagogues because of the coarseness of their apparel-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.3'>Therefore they were not permitted to enter into their synagogues to worship God, being esteemed as filthiness; therefore they were poor; yea, they were esteemed by their brethren as dross; therefore they were poor as to things of the world; and also they were poor in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.4'>Now, as Alma was teaching and speaking unto the people upon the hill Onidah, there came a great multitude unto him, who were those of whom we have been speaking, of whom were poor in heart, because of their poverty as to the things of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.5'>And they came unto Alma; and the one who was the foremost among them said unto him: Behold, what shall these my brethren do, for they are despised of all men because of their poverty, yea, and more especially by our priests; for they have cast us out of our synagogues which we have labored abundantly to build with our own hands; and they have cast us out because of our exceeding poverty; and we have no place to worship our God; and behold, what shall we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.6'>And now when Alma heard this, he turned him about, his face immediately towards him, and he beheld with great joy; for he beheld that their afflictions had truly humbled them, and that they were in a preparation to hear the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.7'>Therefore he did say no more to the other multitude; but he stretched forth his hand, and cried unto those whom he beheld, who were truly penitent, and said unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.8'>I behold that ye are lowly in heart; and if so, blessed are ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.9'>Behold thy brother hath said, What shall we do?-for we are cast out of our synagogues, that we cannot worship our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.10'>Behold I say unto you, do ye suppose that ye cannot worship God save it be in your synagogues only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.11'>And moreover, I would ask, do ye suppose that ye must not worship God only once in a week?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.12'>I say unto you, it is well that ye are cast out of your synagogues, that ye may be humble, and that ye may learn wisdom; for it is necessary that ye should learn wisdom; for it is because that ye are cast out, that ye are despised of your brethren because of your exceeding poverty, that ye are brought to a lowliness of heart; for ye are necessarily brought to be humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.13'>And now, because ye are compelled to be humble blessed are ye; for a man sometimes, if he is compelled to be humble, seeketh repentance; and now surely, whosoever repenteth shall find mercy; and he that findeth mercy and endureth to the end the same shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.14'>And now, as I said unto you, that because ye were compelled to be humble ye were blessed, do ye not suppose that they are more blessed who truly humble themselves because of the word?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.15'>Yea, he that truly humbleth himself, and repenteth of his sins, and endureth to the end, the same shall be blessed-yea, much more blessed than they who are compelled to be humble because of their exceeding poverty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.16'>Therefore, blessed are they who humble themselves without being compelled to be humble; or rather, in other words, blessed is he that believeth in the word of God, and is baptized without stubbornness of heart, yea, without being brought to know the word, or even compelled to know, before they will believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.17'>Yea, there are many who do say: If thou wilt show unto us a sign from heaven, then we shall know of a surety; then we shall believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.18'>Now I ask, is this faith? Behold, I say unto you, Nay; for if a man knoweth a thing he hath no cause to believe, for he knoweth it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.19'>And now, how much more cursed is he that knoweth the will of God and doeth it not, than he that only believeth, or only hath cause to believe, and falleth into transgression?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.20'>Now of this thing ye must judge. Behold, I say unto you, that it is on the one hand even as it is on the other; and it shall be unto every man according to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.21'>And now as I said concerning faith-faith is not to have a perfect knowledge of things; therefore if ye have faith ye hope for things which are not seen, which are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.22'>And now, behold, I say unto you, and I would that ye should remember, that God is merciful unto all who believe on his name; therefore he desireth, in the first place, that ye should believe, yea, even on his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.23'>And now, he imparteth his word by angels unto men, yea, not only men but women also. Now this is not all; little children do have words given unto them many times, which confound the wise and the learned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.24'>And now, my beloved brethren, as ye have desired to know of me what ye shall do because ye are afflicted and cast out-now I do not desire that ye should suppose that I mean to judge you only according to that which is true-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.25'>For I do not mean that ye all of you have been compelled to humble yourselves; for I verily believe that there are some among you who would humble themselves, let them be in whatsoever circumstances they might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.26'>Now, as I said concerning faith-that it was not a perfect knowledge-even so it is with my words. Ye cannot know of their surety at first, unto perfection, any more than faith is a perfect knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.27'>But behold, if ye will awake and arouse your faculties, even to an experiment upon my words, and exercise a particle of faith, yea, even if ye can no more than desire to believe, let this desire work in you, even until ye believe in a manner that ye can give place for a portion of my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.28'>Now, we will compare the word unto a seed. Now, if ye give place, that a seed may be planted in your heart, behold, if it be a true seed, or a good seed, if ye do not cast it out by your unbelief, that ye will resist the Spirit of the Lord, behold, it will begin to swell within your breasts; and when you feel these swelling motions, ye will begin to say within yourselves-It must needs be that this is a good seed, or that the word is good, for it beginneth to enlarge my soul; yea, it beginneth to enlighten my understanding, yea, it beginneth to be delicious to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.29'>Now behold, would not this increase your faith? I say unto you, Yea; nevertheless it hath not grown up to a perfect knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.30'>But behold, as the seed swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow, then you must needs say that the seed is good; for behold it swelleth, and sprouteth, and beginneth to grow. And now, behold, will not this strengthen your faith? Yea, it will strengthen your faith: for ye will say I know that this is a good seed; for behold it sprouteth and beginneth to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.31'>And now, behold, are ye sure that this is a good seed? I say unto you, Yea; for every seed bringeth forth unto its own likeness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.32'>Therefore, if a seed groweth it is good, but if it groweth not, behold it is not good, therefore it is cast away.</verse>

Yea, your knowledge is perfect in that thing, and your faith is dormant; and this because you know, for ye know that the word hath swelled your souls, and ye also know that it hath sprouted up, that your understanding doth begin to be enlightened, and your mind doth begin to expand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.35'>O then, is not this real? I say unto you, Yea, because it is light; and whatsoever is light, is good, because it is discernible, therefore ye must know that it is good; and now behold, after ye have tasted this light is your knowledge perfect?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.37'>And behold, as the tree beginneth to grow, ye will say: Let us nourish it with great care, that it may get root, that it may grow up, and bring forth fruit unto us. And now behold, if ye nourish it with much care it will get root, and grow up, and bring forth fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.38'>But if ye neglect the tree, and take no thought for its nourishment, behold it will not get any root; and when the heat of the sun cometh and scorcheth it, because it hath no root it withers away, and ye pluck it up and cast it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.39'>Now, this is not because the seed was not good, neither is it because the fruit thereof would not be desirable; but it is because your ground is barren, and ye will not nourish the tree, therefore ye cannot have the fruit thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.40'>And thus, if ye will not nourish the word, looking forward with an eye of faith to the fruit thereof, ye can never pluck of the fruit of the tree of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.41'>But if ye will nourish the word, yea, nourish the tree as it beginneth to grow, by your faith with great diligence, and with patience, looking forward to the fruit thereof, it shall take root; and behold it shall be a tree springing up unto everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.42'>And because of your diligence and your faith and your patience with the word in nourishing it, that it may take root in you, behold, by and by ye shall pluck the fruit thereof, which is most precious, which is sweet above all that is sweet, and which is white above all that is white, yea, and pure above all that is pure; and ye shall feast upon this fruit even until ye are filled, that ye hunger not, neither shall ye thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.32.43'>Then, my brethren, ye shall reap the rewards of your faith, and your diligence, and patience, and long-suffering, waiting for the tree to bring forth fruit unto you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.1'>NOW after Alma had spoken these words, they sent forth unto him desiring to know whether they should believe in one God, that they might obtain this fruit of which he had spoken, or how they should plant the seed, or the word of which he had spoken, which he said must be planted in their hearts; or in what manner they should begin to exercise their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.2'>And Alma said unto them: Behold, ye have said that ye could not worship your God because ye are cast out of your synagogues. But behold, I say unto you, if ye suppose that ye cannot worship God, ye do greatly err, and ye ought to search the scriptures; if ye suppose that they have taught you this, ye do not understand them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.3'>Do ye remember to have read what Zenos, the prophet of old, has said concerning prayer or worship?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.4'>For he said: Thou art merciful, O God, for thou hast heard my prayer, even when I was in the wilderness; yea, thou wast merciful when I prayed concerning those who were mine enemies, and thou didst turn them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.5'>Yea, O God, and thou wast merciful unto me when I did cry unto thee in my field; when I did cry unto thee in my prayer, and thou didst hear me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.8'>Yea, thou art merciful unto thy children when they cry unto thee, to be heard of thee and not of men, and thou wilt hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.9'>Yea, O God, thou hast been merciful unto me, and heard my cries in the midst of thy congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.10'>Yea, and thou hast also heard me when I have been cast out and have been despised by mine enemies; yea, thou didst hear my cries, and wast angry with mine enemies, and thou didst visit them in thine anger with speedy destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.11'>And thou didst hear me because of mine afflictions and my sincerity; and it is because of thy Son that thou hast been thus merciful unto me, therefore I will cry unto thee in all mine afflictions, for in thee is my joy; for thou hast turned thy judgments away from me, because of thy Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.12'>And now Alma said unto them: Do ye believe those scriptures which have been written by them of old?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.13'>Behold, if ye do, ye must believe what Zenos said; for, behold he said: Thou hast turned away thy judgments because of thy Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.14'>Now behold, my brethren, I would ask if ye have read the scriptures? If ye have, how can ye disbelieve on the Son of God?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.17'>And now, my brethren, ye see that a second prophet of old has testified of the Son of God, and because the people would not understand his words they stoned him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.18'>But behold, this is not all; these are not the only ones who have spoken concerning the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.19'>Behold, he was spoken of by Moses; yea, and behold a type was raised up in the wilderness, that whosoever would look upon it might live. And many did look and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.20'>But few understood the meaning of those things, and this because of the hardness of their hearts. But there were many who were so hardened that they would not look, therefore they perished. Now the reason they would not look is because they did not believe that it would heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.33.21'>O my brethren, if ye could be healed by merely casting about your eyes that ye might be healed, would ye not behold quickly, or would ye rather harden your hearts in unbelief, and be slothful, that ye would not cast about your eyes, that ye might perish?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.34'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.1'>AND now it came to pass that after Alma had spoken these words unto them he sat down upon the ground, and Amulek arose and began to teach them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.2'>My brethren, I think that it is impossible that ye should be ignorant of the things which have been spoken concerning the coming of Christ, who is taught by us to be the Son of God; yea, I know that these things were taught unto you bountifully before your dissension from among us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.3'>And as ye have desired of my beloved brother that he should make known unto you what ye should do, because of your afflictions; and he hath spoken somewhat unto you to prepare your minds; yea, and he hath exhorted you unto faith and to patience-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.4'>Yea, even that ye would have so much faith as even to plant the word in your hearts, that ye may try the experiment of its goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.5'>And we have beheld that the great question which is in your minds is whether the word be in the Son of God, or whether there shall be no Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.6'>And ye also beheld that my brother has proved unto you, in many instances, that the word is in Christ unto salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.7'>My brother has called upon the words of Zenos, that redemption cometh through the Son of God, and also upon the words of Zenock; and also he has appealed unto Moses, to prove that these things are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.8'>And now, behold, I will testify unto you of myself that these things are true. Behold, I say unto you, that I do know that Christ shall come among the children of men, to take upon him the transgressions of his people, and that he shall atone for the sins of the world; for the Lord God hath spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.9'>For it is expedient that an atonement should be made; for according to the great plan of the Eternal God there must be an atonement made, or else all mankind must unavoidably perish; yea, all are hardened; yea, all are fallen and are lost, and must perish except it be through the atonement which it is expedient should be made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.10'>For it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice; yea, not a sacrifice of man, neither of beast, neither of any manner of fowl; for it shall not be a human sacrifice; but it must be an infinite and eternal sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.11'>Now there is not any man that can sacrifice his own blood which will atone for the sins of another. Now, if a man murdereth, behold will our law, which is just, take the life of his brother? I say unto you, Nay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.12'>But the law requireth the life of him who hath murdered; therefore there can be nothing which is short of an infinite atonement which will suffice for the sins of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.13'>Therefore, it is expedient that there should be a great and last sacrifice, and then shall there be, or it is expedient there should be, a stop to the shedding of blood; then shall the law of Moses be fulfilled; yea, it shall be all fulfilled, every jot and tittle, and none shall have passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.14'>And behold, this is the whole meaning of the law, every whit pointing to that great and last sacrifice; and that great and last sacrifice will be the Son of God, yea, infinite and eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.15'>And thus he shall bring salvation to all those who shall believe on his name; this being the intent of this last sacrifice, to bring about the bowels of mercy, which overpowereth justice, and bringeth about means unto men that they may have faith unto repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.16'>And thus mercy can satisfy the demands of justice, and encircles them in the arms of safety, while he that exercises no faith unto repentance is exposed to the whole law of the demands of justice; therefore only unto him that has faith unto repentance is brought about the great and eternal plan of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.17'>Therefore may God grant unto you, my brethren, that ye may begin to exercise your faith unto repentance, that ye begin to call upon his holy name, that he would have mercy upon you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.18'>Yea, cry unto him for mercy; for he is mighty to save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.19'>Yea, humble yourselves, and continue in prayer unto him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.26'>But this is not all; ye must pour out your souls in your closets, and your secret places, and in your wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.27'>Yea, and when you do not cry unto the Lord, let your hearts be full, drawn out in prayer unto him continually for your welfare, and also for the welfare of those who are around you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.28'>And now behold, my beloved brethren, I say unto you, do not suppose that this is all; for after ye have done all these things, if ye turn away the needy, and the naked, and visit not the sick and afflicted, and impart of your substance, if ye have, to those who stand in need-I say unto you, if ye do not any of these things, behold, your prayer is vain, and availeth you nothing, and ye are as hypocrites who do deny the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.29'>Therefore, if ye do not remember to be charitable, ye are as dross, which the refiners do cast out, (it being of no worth) and is trodden under foot of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.30'>And now, my brethren, I would that, after ye have received so many witnesses, seeing that the holy scriptures testify of these things, ye come forth and bring fruit unto repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.31'>Yea, I would that ye would come forth and harden not your hearts any longer; for behold, now is the time and the day of your salvation; and therefore, if ye will repent and harden not your hearts, immediately shall the great plan of redemption be brought about unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.32'>For behold, this life is the time for men to prepare to meet God; yea, behold the day of this life is the day for men to perform their labors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.33'>And now, as I said unto you before, as ye have had so many witnesses, therefore, I beseech of you that ye do not procrastinate the day of your repentance until the end; for after this day of life, which is given us to prepare for eternity, behold, if we do not improve our time while in this life, then cometh the night of darkness wherein there can be no labor performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.34'>Ye cannot say, when ye are brought to that awful crisis, that I will repent, that I will return to my God. Nay, ye cannot say this; for that same spirit which doth possess your bodies at the time that ye go out of this life, that same spirit will have power to possess your body in that eternal world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.35'>For behold, if ye have procrastinated the day of your repentance even until death, behold, ye have become subjected to the spirit of the devil, and he doth seal you his; therefore, the Spirit of the Lord hath withdrawn from you, and hath no place in you, and the devil hath all power over you; and this is the final state of the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.36'>And this I know, because the Lord hath said he dwelleth not in unholy temples, but in the hearts of the righteous doth he dwell; yea, and he has also said that the righteous shall sit down in his kingdom, to go no more out; but their garments should be made white through the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.37'>And now, my beloved brethren, I desire that ye should remember these things, and that ye should work out your salvation with fear before God, and that ye should no more deny the coming of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.38'>That ye contend no more against the Holy Ghost, but that ye receive it, and take upon you the name of Christ; that ye humble yourselves even to the dust, and worship God, in whatsoever place ye may be in, in spirit and in truth; and that ye live in thanksgiving daily, for the many mercies and blessings which he doth bestow upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.39'>Yea, and I also exhort you, my brethren, that ye be watchful unto prayer continually, that ye may not be led away by the temptations of the devil, that he may not overpower you, that ye may not become his subjects at the last day; for behold, he rewardeth you no good thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.34.40'>And now my beloved brethren, I would exhort you to have patience, and that ye bear with all manner of afflictions; that ye do not revile against those who do cast you out because of your exceeding poverty, lest ye become sinners like unto them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.20'>And oh, what joy, and what marvelous light I did behold; yea, my soul was filled with joy as exceeding as was my pain!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.21'>Yea, I say unto you, my son, that there could be nothing so exquisite and so bitter as were my pains. Yea, and again I say unto you, my son, that on the other hand, there can be nothing so exquisite and sweet as was my joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.22'>Yea, methought I saw, even as our father Lehi saw, God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels, in the attitude of singing and praising their God; yea, and my soul did long to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.23'>But behold, my limbs did receive their strength again, and I stood upon my feet, and did manifest unto the people that I had been born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.24'>Yea, and from that time even until now, I have labored without ceasing, that I might bring souls unto repentance; that I might bring them to taste of the exceeding joy of which I did taste; that they might also be born of God, and be filled with the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.25'>Yea, and now behold, O my son, the Lord doth give me exceedingly great joy in the fruit of my labors;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.26'>For because of the word which he has imparted unto me, behold, many have been born of God, and have tasted as I have tasted, and have seen eye to eye as I have seen; therefore they do know of these things of which I have spoken, as I do know; and the knowledge which I have is of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.27'>And I have been supported under trials and troubles of every kind, yea, and in all manner of afflictions; yea, God has delivered me from prison, and from bonds, and from death; yea, and I do put my trust in him, and he will still deliver me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.28'>And I know that he will raise me up at the last day, to dwell with him in glory; yea, and I will praise him forever, for he has brought our fathers out of Egypt, and he has swallowed up the Egyptians in the Red Sea; and he led them by his power into the promised land; yea, and he has delivered them out of bondage and captivity from time to time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.29'>Yea, and he has also brought our fathers out of the land of Jerusalem; and he has also, by his everlasting power, delivered them out of bondage and captivity, from time to time even down to the present day; and I have always retained in remembrance their captivity; yea, and ye also ought to retain in remembrance, as I have done, their captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.36.30'>But behold, my son, this is not all; for ye ought to know as I do know, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and ye ought to know also, that inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence. Now this is according to his word.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.1'>AND now, my son Helaman, I command you that ye take the records which have been entrusted with me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.2'>And I also command you that ye keep a record of this people, according as I have done, upon the plates of Nephi, and keep all these things sacred which I have kept, even as I have kept them; for it is for a wise purpose that they are kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.3'>And these plates of brass, which contain these engravings, which have the records of the holy scriptures upon them, which have the genealogy of our forefathers, even from the beginning-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.4'>Behold, it has been prophesied by our fathers, that they should be kept and handed down from one generation to another, and be kept and preserved by the hand of the Lord until they should go forth unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, that they shall know of the mysteries contained thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.5'>And now behold, if they are kept they must retain their brightness; yea, and they will retain their brightness; yea, and also shall all the plates which do contain that which is holy writ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.6'>Now ye may suppose that this is foolishness in me; but behold I say unto you, that by small and simple things are great things brought to pass; and small means in many instances doth confound the wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.7'>And the Lord God doth work by means to bring about his great and eternal purposes; and by very small means the Lord doth confound the wise and bringeth about the salvation of many souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.8'>And now, it has hitherto been wisdom in God that these things should be preserved; for behold, they have enlarged the memory of this people, yea, and convinced many of the error of their ways, and brought them to the knowledge of their God unto the salvation of their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.9'>Yea, I say unto you, were it not for these things that these records do contain, which are on these plates, Ammon and his brethren could not have convinced so many thousands of the Lamanites of the incorrect tradition of their fathers; yea, these records and their words brought them unto repentance; that is, they brought them to the knowledge of the Lord their God, and to rejoice in Jesus Christ their Redeemer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.10'>And who knoweth but what they will be the means of bringing many thousands of them, yea, and also many thousands of our stiffnecked brethren, the Nephites, who are now hardening their hearts in sin and iniquities, to the knowledge of their Redeemer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.11'>Now these mysteries are not yet fully made known unto me; therefore I shall forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.12'>And it may suffice if I only say they are preserved for a wise purpose, which purpose is known unto God; for he doth counsel in wisdom over all his works, and his paths are straight, and his course is one eternal round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.13'>O remember, remember, my son Helaman, how strict are the commandments of God. And he said: If ye will keep my commandments ye shall prosper in the land-but if ye keep not his commandments ye shall be cut off from his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.14'>And now remember, my son, that God has entrusted you with these things, which are sacred, which he has kept sacred, and also which he will keep and preserve for a wise purpose in him, that he may show forth his power unto future generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.15'>And now behold, I tell you by the spirit of prophecy, that if ye transgress the commandments of God, behold, these things which are sacred shall be taken away from you by the power of God, and ye shall be delivered up unto Satan, that he may sift you as chaff before the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.16'>But if ye keep the commandments of God, and do with these things which are sacred according to that which the Lord doth command you, (for you must appeal unto the Lord for all things whatsoever ye must do with them) behold, no power of earth or hell can take them from you, for God is powerful to the fulfilling of all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.17'>For he will fulfil all his promises which he shall make unto you, for he has fulfilled his promises which he has made unto our fathers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.20'>Therefore I command you, my son Helaman, that ye be diligent in fulfilling all my words, and that ye be diligent in keeping the commandments of God as they are written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.21'>And now, I will speak unto you concerning those twenty-four plates, that ye keep them, that the mysteries and the works of darkness, and their secret works, or the secret works of those people who have been destroyed, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, all their murders, and robbings, and their plunderings, and all their wickedness and abominations, may be made manifest unto this people; yea, and that ye preserve these interpreters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.22'>For behold, the Lord saw that his people began to work in darkness, yea, work secret murders and abominations; therefore the Lord said, if they did not repent they should be destroyed from off the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.23'>And the Lord said: I will prepare unto my servant Gazelem, a stone, which shall shine forth in darkness unto light, that I may discover unto my people who serve me, that I may discover unto them the works of their brethren, yea, their secret works, their works of darkness, and their wickedness and abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.24'>And now, my son, these interpreters were prepared that the word of God might be fulfilled, which he spake, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.25'>I will bring forth out of darkness unto light all their secret works and their abominations; and except they repent I will destroy them from off the face of the earth; and I will bring to light all their secrets and abominations, unto every nation that shall hereafter possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.26'>And now, my son, we see that they did not repent; therefore they have been destroyed, and thus far the word of God has been fulfilled; yea, their secret abominations have been brought out of darkness and made known unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.27'>And now, my son, I command you that ye retain all their oaths, and their covenants, and their agreements in their secret abominations; yea, and all their signs and their wonders ye shall keep from this people, that they know them not, lest peradventure they should fall into darkness also and be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.28'>For behold, there is a curse upon all this land, that destruction shall come upon all those workers of darkness, according to the power of God, when they are fully ripe; therefore I desire that this people might not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.29'>Therefore ye shall keep these secret plans of their oaths and their covenants from this people, and only their wickedness and their murders and their abominations shall ye make known unto them; and ye shall teach them to abhor such wickedness and abominations and murders; and ye shall also teach them that these people were destroyed on account of their wickedness and abominations and their murders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.30'>For behold, they murdered all the prophets of the Lord who came among them to declare unto them concerning their iniquities; and the blood of those whom they murdered did cry unto the Lord their God for vengeance upon those who were their murderers; and thus the judgments of God did come upon these workers of darkness and secret combinations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.31'>Yea, and cursed be the land forever and ever unto those workers of darkness and secret combinations, even unto destruction, except they repent before they are fully ripe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.32'>And now, my son, remember the words which I have spoken unto you; trust not those secret plans unto this people, but teach them an everlasting hatred against sin and iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.33'>Preach unto them repentance, and faith on the Lord Jesus Christ; teach them to humble themselves and to be meek and lowly in heart; teach them to withstand every temptation of the devil, with their faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.34'>Teach them to never be weary of good works, but to be meek and lowly in heart; for such shall find rest to their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.35'>O, remember, my son, and learn wisdom in thy youth; yea, learn in thy youth to keep the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.36'>Yea, and cry unto God for all thy support; yea, let all thy doings be unto the Lord, and whithersoever thou goest let it be in the Lord; yea, let all thy thoughts be directed unto the Lord; yea, let the affections of thy heart be placed upon the Lord forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.37'>Counsel with the Lord in all thy doings, and he will direct thee for good; yea, when thou liest down at night lie down unto the Lord, that he may watch over you in your sleep; and when thou risest in the morning let thy heart be full of thanks unto God; and if ye do these things, ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.38'>And now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the thing which our fathers call a ball, or director-or our fathers called it Liahona, which is, being interpreted, a compass; and the Lord prepared it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.39'>And behold, there cannot any man work after the manner of so curious a workmanship. And behold, it was prepared to show unto our fathers the course which they should travel in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.40'>And it did work for them according to their faith in God; therefore, if they had faith to believe that God could cause that those spindles should point the way they should go, behold, it was done; therefore they had this miracle, and also many other miracles wrought by the power of God, day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.41'>Nevertheless, because those miracles were worked by small means it did show unto them marvelous works. They were slothful, and forgot to exercise their faith and diligence and then those marvelous works ceased, and they did not progress in their journey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.42'>Therefore, they tarried in the wilderness, or did not travel a direct course, and were afflicted with hunger and thirst, because of their transgressions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.43'>And now, my son, I would that ye should understand that these things are not without a shadow; for as our fathers were slothful to give heed to this compass (now these things were temporal) they did not prosper; even so it is with things which are spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.44'>For behold, it is as easy to give heed to the word of Christ, which will point to you a straight course to eternal bliss, as it was for our fathers to give heed to this compass, which would point unto them a straight course to the promised land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.45'>And now I say, is there not a type in this thing? For just as surely as this director did bring our fathers, by following its course, to the promised land, shall the words of Christ, if we follow their course, carry us beyond this vale of sorrow into a far better land of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.46'>O my son, do not let us be slothful because of the easiness of the way; for so was it with our fathers; for so was it prepared for them, that if they would look they might live; even so it is with us. The way is prepared, and if we will look we may live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.37.47'>And now, my son, see that ye take care of these sacred things, yea, see that ye look to God and live. Go unto this people and declare the word, and be sober. My son, farewell.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.1'>MY son, give ear to my words, for I say unto you, even as I said unto Helaman, that inasmuch as ye shall keep the commandments of God ye shall prosper in the land; and inasmuch as ye will not keep the commandments of God ye shall be cut off from his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.2'>And now, my son, I trust that I shall have great joy in you, because of your steadiness and your faithfulness unto God; for as you have commenced in your youth to look to the Lord your God, even so I hope that you will continue in keeping his commandments; for blessed is he that endureth to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.3'>I say unto you, my son, that I have had great joy in thee already, because of thy faithfulness and thy diligence, and thy patience and thy long-suffering among the people of the Zoramites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.4'>For I know that thou wast in bonds; yea, and I also know that thou wast stoned for the word's sake; and thou didst bear all these things with patience because the Lord was with thee; and now thou knowest that the Lord did deliver thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.5'>And now my son, Shiblon, I would that ye should remember, that as much as ye shall put your trust in God even so much ye shall be delivered out of your trials, and your troubles, and your afflictions, and ye shall be lifted up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.6'>Now, my son, I would not that ye should think that I know these things of myself, but it is the Spirit of God which is in me which maketh these things known unto me; for if I had not been born of God I should not have known these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.7'>But behold, the Lord in his great mercy sent his angel to declare unto me that I must stop the work of destruction among his people; yea, and I have seen an angel face to face, and he spake with me, and his voice was as thunder, and it shook the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.8'>And it came to pass that I was three days and three nights in the most bitter pain and anguish of soul; and never, until I did cry out unto the Lord Jesus Christ for mercy, did I receive a remission of my sins.

Behold, he is the life and the light of the world. Behold, he is the word of truth and righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.38.10'>And now, as ye have begun to teach the word even so I would that ye should continue to teach; and I would that ye would be diligent and temperate in all things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.39.2'>For thou didst not give so much heed unto my words as did thy brother, among the people of the Zoramites. Now this is what I have against thee; thou didst go on unto boasting in thy strength and thy wisdom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.39.4'>Yea, she did steal away the hearts of many; but this was no excuse for thee, my son. Thou shouldst have tended to the ministry wherewith thou wast entrusted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.11'>Now, concerning the state of the soul between death and the resurrection-Behold, it has been made known unto me by an angel, that the spirits of all men, as soon as they are departed from this mortal body, yea, the spirits of all men, whether they be good or evil, are taken home to that God who gave them life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.12'>And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of those who are righteous are received into a state of happiness, which is called paradise, a state of rest, a state of peace, where they shall rest from all their troubles and from all care, and sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.13'>And then shall it come to pass, that the spirits of the wicked, yea, who are evil-for behold, they have no part nor portion of the Spirit of the Lord; for behold, they chose evil works rather than good; therefore the spirit of the devil did enter into them, and take possession of their house-and these shall be cast out into outer darkness; there shall be weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth, and this because of their own iniquity, being led captive by the will of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.14'>Now this is the state of the souls of the wicked, yea, in darkness, and a state of awful, fearful looking for the fiery indignation of the wrath of God upon them; thus they remain in this state, as well as the righteous in paradise, until the time of their resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.15'>Now, there are some that have understood that this state of happiness and this state of misery of the soul, before the resurrection, was a first resurrection. Yea, I admit it may be termed a resurrection, the raising of the spirit or the soul and their consignation to happiness or misery, according to the words which have been spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.16'>And behold, again it hath been spoken, that there is a first resurrection, a resurrection of all those who have been, or who are, or who shall be, down to the resurrection of Christ from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.17'>Now, we do not suppose that this first resurrection, which is spoken of in this manner, can be the resurrection of the souls and their consignation to happiness or misery. Ye cannot suppose that this is what it meaneth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.18'>Behold, I say unto you, Nay; but it meaneth the reuniting of the soul with the body, of those from the days of Adam down to the resurrection of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.19'>Now, whether the souls and the bodies of those of whom has been spoken shall all be reunited at once, the wicked as well as the righteous, I do not say; let it suffice, that I say that they all come forth; or in other words, their resurrection cometh to pass before the resurrection of those who die after the resurrection of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.20'>Now, my son, I do not say that their resurrection cometh at the resurrection of Christ; but behold, I give it as my opinion, that the souls and the bodies are reunited, of the righteous, at the resurrection of Christ, and his ascension into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.21'>But whether it be at his resurrection or after, I do not say; but this much I say, that there is a space between death and the resurrection of the body, and a state of the soul in happiness or in misery until the time which is appointed of God that the dead shall come forth, and be reunited, both soul and body, and be brought to stand before God, and be judged according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.22'>Yea, this bringeth about the restoration of those things of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.23'>The soul shall be restored to the body, and the body to the soul; yea, and every limb and joint shall be restored to its body; yea, even a hair of the head shall not be lost; but all things shall be restored to their proper and perfect frame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.24'>And now, my son, this is the restoration of which has been spoken by the mouths of the prophets-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.25'>And then shall the righteous shine forth in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.40.26'>But behold, an awful death cometh upon the wicked; for they die as to things pertaining to things of righteousness; for they are unclean, and no unclean thing can inherit the kingdom of God; but they are cast out, and consigned to partake of the fruits of their labors or their works, which have been evil; and they drink the dregs of a bitter cup.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.41'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.1'>AND now, my son, I have somewhat to say concerning the restoration of which has been spoken; for behold, some have wrested the scriptures, and have gone far astray because of this thing. And I perceive that thy mind has been worried also concerning this thing. But behold, I will explain it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.2'>I say unto thee, my son, that the plan of restoration is requisite with the justice of God; for it is requisite that all things should be restored to their proper order. Behold, it is requisite and just, according to the power and resurrection of Christ, that the soul of man should be restored to its body, and that every part of the body should be restored to itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.3'>And it is requisite with the justice of God that men should be judged according to their works; and if their works were good in this life, and the desires of their hearts were good, that they should also, at the last day, be restored unto that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.4'>And if their works are evil they shall be restored unto them for evil. Therefore, all things shall be restored to their proper order, every thing to its natural frame-mortality raised to immortality, corruption to incorruption-raised to endless happiness to inherit the kingdom of God, or to endless misery to inherit the kingdom of the devil, the one on one hand, the other on the other-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.5'>The one raised to happiness according to his desires of happiness, or good according to his desires of good; and the other to evil according to his desires of evil; for as he has desired to do evil all the day long even so shall he have his reward of evil when the night cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.6'>And so it is on the other hand. If he hath repented of his sins, and desired righteousness until the end of his days, even so he shall be rewarded unto righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.7'>These are they that are redeemed of the Lord; yea, these are they that are taken out, that are delivered from that endless night of darkness; and thus they stand or fall; for behold, they are their own judges, whether to do good or do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.8'>Now, the decrees of God are unalterable; therefore, the way is prepared that whosoever will may walk therein and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.9'>And now behold, my son, do not risk one more offense against your God upon those points of doctrine, which ye have hitherto risked to commit sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.10'>Do not suppose, because it has been spoken concerning restoration, that ye shall be restored from sin to happiness. Behold, I say unto you, wickedness never was happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.11'>And now, my son, all men that are in a state of nature, or I would say, in a carnal state, are in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; they are without God in the world, and they have gone contrary to the nature of God; therefore, they are in a state contrary to the nature of happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.12'>And now behold, is the meaning of the word restoration to take a thing of a natural state and place it in an unnatural state, or to place it in a state opposite to its nature?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.13'>O, my son, this is not the case; but the meaning of the word restoration is to bring back again evil for evil, or carnal for carnal, or devilish for devilish-good for that which is good; righteous for that which is righteous; just for that which is just; merciful for that which is merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.14'>Therefore, my son, see that you are merciful unto your brethren; deal justly, judge righteously, and do good continually; and if ye do all these things then shall ye receive your reward; yea, ye shall have mercy restored unto you again; ye shall have justice restored unto you again; ye shall have a righteous judgment restored unto you again; and ye shall have good rewarded unto you again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.41.15'>For that which ye do send out shall return unto you again, and be restored; therefore, the word restoration more fully condemneth the sinner, and justifieth him not at all.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.42'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.1'>AND now, my son, I perceive there is somewhat more which doth worry your mind, which ye cannot understand-which is concerning the justice of God in the punishment of the sinner; for ye do try to suppose that it is injustice that the sinner should be consigned to a state of misery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.2'>Now behold, my son, I will explain this thing unto thee. For behold, after the Lord God sent our first parents forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground, from whence they were taken-yea, he drew out the man, and he placed at the east end of the garden of Eden, cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the tree of life-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.3'>Now, we see that the man had become as God, knowing good and evil; and lest he should put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live forever, the Lord God placed cherubim and the flaming sword, that he should not partake of the fruit-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.4'>And thus we see, that there was a time granted unto man to repent, yea, a probationary time, a time to repent and serve God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.5'>For behold, if Adam had put forth his hand immediately, and partaken of the tree of life, he would have lived forever, according to the word of God, having no space for repentance; yea, and also the word of God would have been void, and the great plan of salvation would have been frustrated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.6'>But behold, it was appointed unto man to die-therefore, as they were cut off from the tree of life they should be cut off from the face of the earth-and man became lost forever, yea, they became fallen man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.7'>And now, ye see by this that our first parents were cut off both temporally and spiritually from the presence of the Lord; and thus we see they became subjects to follow after their own will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.8'>Now behold, it was not expedient that man should be reclaimed from this temporal death, for that would destroy the great plan of happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.9'>Therefore, as the soul could never die, and the fall had brought upon all mankind a spiritual death as well as a temporal, that is, they were cut off from the presence of the Lord, it was expedient that mankind should be reclaimed from this spiritual death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.10'>Therefore, as they had become carnal, sensual, and devilish, by nature, this probationary state became a state for them to prepare; it became a preparatory state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.11'>And now remember, my son, if it were not for the plan of redemption, (laying it aside) as soon as they were dead their souls were miserable, being cut off from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.12'>And now, there was no means to reclaim men from this fallen state, which man had brought upon himself because of his own disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.13'>Therefore, according to justice, the plan of redemption could not be brought about, only on conditions of repentance of men in this probationary state, yea, this preparatory state; for except it were for these conditions, mercy could not take effect except it should destroy the work of justice. Now the work of justice could not be destroyed; if so, God would cease to be God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.14'>And thus we see that all mankind were fallen, and they were in the grasp of justice; yea, the justice of God, which consigned them forever to be cut off from his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.15'>And now, the plan of mercy could not be brought about except an atonement should be made; therefore God himself atoneth for the sins of the world, to bring about the plan of mercy, to appease the demands of justice, that God might be a perfect, just God, and a merciful God also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.16'>Now, repentance could not come unto men except there were a punishment, which also was eternal as the life of the soul should be, affixed opposite to the plan of happiness, which was as eternal also as the life of the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.17'>Now, how could a man repent except he should sin? How could he sin if there was no law? How could there be a law save there was a punishment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.18'>Now, there was a punishment affixed, and a just law given, which brought remorse of conscience unto man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.19'>Now, if there was no law given-if a man murdered he should die-would he be afraid he would die if he should murder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.20'>And also, if there was no law given against sin men would not be afraid to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.21'>And if there was no law given, if men sinned what could justice do, or mercy either, for they would have no claim upon the creature?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.22'>But there is a law given, and a punishment affixed, and a repentance granted; which repentance, mercy claimeth; otherwise, justice claimeth the creature and executeth the law, and the law inflicteth the punishment; if not so, the works of justice would be destroyed, and God would cease to be God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.23'>But God ceaseth not to be God, and mercy claimeth the penitent, and mercy cometh because of the atonement; and the atonement bringeth to pass the resurrection of the dead; and the resurrection of the dead bringeth back men into the presence of God; and thus they are restored into his presence, to be judged according to their works, according to the law and justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.24'>For behold, justice exerciseth all his demands, and also mercy claimeth all which is her own; and thus, none but the truly penitent are saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.25'>What, do ye suppose that mercy can rob justice? I say unto you, Nay; not one whit. If so, God would cease to be God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.26'>And thus God bringeth about his great and eternal purposes, which were prepared from the foundation of the world. And thus cometh about the salvation and the redemption of men, and also their destruction and misery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.27'>Therefore, O my son, whosoever will come may come and partake of the waters of life freely; and whosoever will not come the same is not compelled to come; but in the last day it shall be restored unto him according to his deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.28'>If he has desired to do evil, and has not repented in his days, behold, evil shall be done unto him, according to the restoration of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.29'>And now, my son, I desire that ye should let these things trouble you no more, and only let your sins trouble you, with that trouble which shall bring you down unto repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.30'>O my son, I desire that ye should deny the justice of God no more. Do not endeavor to excuse yourself in the least point because of your sins, by denying the justice of God; but do you let the justice of God, and his mercy, and his long-suffering have full sway in your heart; and let it bring you down to the dust in humility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.42.31'>And now, O my son, ye are called of God to preach the word unto this people. And now, my son, go thy way, declare the word with truth and soberness, that thou mayest bring souls unto repentance, that the great plan of mercy may have claim upon them. And may God grant unto you even according to my words. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.1'>AND now it came to pass that the sons of Alma did go forth among the people, to declare the word unto them. And Alma, also, himself, could not rest, and he also went forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.2'>Now we shall say no more concerning their preaching, except that they preached the word, and the truth, according to the spirit of prophecy and revelation; and they preached after the holy order of God by which they were called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.3'>And now I return to an account of the wars between the Nephites and the Lamanites, in the *eighteenth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.4'>For behold, it came to pass that the Zoramites became Lamanites; therefore, in the commencement of the eighteenth year the people of the Nephites saw that the Lamanites were coming upon them; therefore they made preparations for war; yea, they gathered together their armies in the land of Jershon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.5'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites came with their thousands; and they came into the land of Antionum, which is the land of the Zoramites; and a man by the name of Zerahemnah was their leader.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.6'>And now, as the Amalekites were of a more wicked and murderous disposition than the Lamanites were, in and of themselves, therefore, Zerahemnah appointed chief captains over the Lamanites, and they were all Amalekites and Zoramites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.7'>Now this he did that he might preserve their hatred towards the Nephites, that he might bring them into subjection to the accomplishment of his designs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.8'>For behold, his designs were to stir up the Lamanites to anger against the Nephites; this he did that he might usurp great power over them, and also that he might gain power over the Nephites by bringing them into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.9'>And now the design of the Nephites was to support their lands, and their houses, and their wives, and their children, that they might preserve them from the hands of their enemies; and also that they might preserve their rights and their privileges, yea, and also their liberty, that they might worship God according to their desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.10'>For they knew that if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites, that whosoever should worship God in spirit and in truth, the true and the living God, the Lamanites would destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.11'>Yea, and they also knew the extreme hatred of the Lamanites towards their brethren, who were the people of Anti-Nephi-Lehi, who were called the people of Ammon-and they would not take up arms, yea, they had entered into a covenant and they would not break it-therefore, if they should fall into the hands of the Lamanites they would be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.12'>And the Nephites would not suffer that they should be destroyed; therefore they gave them lands for their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.13'>And the people of Ammon did give unto the Nephites a large portion of their substance to support their armies; and thus the Nephites were compelled, alone, to withstand against the Lamanites, who were a compound of Laman and Lemuel, and the sons of Ishmael, and all those who had dissented from the Nephites, who were Amalekites and Zoramites, and the descendants of the priests of Noah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.14'>Now those descendants were as numerous, nearly, as were the Nephites; and thus the Nephites were obliged to contend with their brethren, even unto bloodshed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.23'>But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness Moroni sent spies into the wilderness to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go to defend themselves against the Lamanites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.44'>And they were inspired by the Zoramites and the Amalekites, who were their chief captains and leaders, and by Zerahemnah, who was their chief captain, or their chief leader and commander; yea, they did fight like dragons, and many of the Nephites were slain by their hands, yea, for they did smite in two many of their head-plates, and they did pierce many of their breastplates, and they did smite off many of their arms; and thus the Lamanites did smite in their fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.45'>Nevertheless, the Nephites were inspired by a better cause, for they were not fighting for monarchy nor power but they were fighting for their homes and their liberties, their wives and their children, and their all, yea, for their rites of worship and their church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.46'>And they were doing that which they felt was the duty which they owed to their God; for the Lord had said unto them, and also unto their fathers, that: Inasmuch as ye are not guilty of the first offense, neither the second, ye shall not suffer yourselves to be slain by the hands of your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.47'>And again, the Lord has said that: Ye shall defend your families even unto bloodshed. Therefore for this cause were the Nephites contending with the Lamanites, to defend themselves, and their families, and their lands, their country, and their rights, and their religion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.48'>And it came to pass that when the men of Moroni saw the fierceness and the anger of the Lamanites, they were about to shrink and flee from them. And Moroni, perceiving their intent, sent forth and inspired their hearts with these thoughts-yea, the thoughts of their lands, their liberty, yea, their freedom from bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.49'>And it came to pass that they turned upon the Lamanites, and they cried with one voice unto the Lord their God, for their liberty and their freedom from bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.50'>And they began to stand against the Lamanites with power; and in that selfsame hour that they cried unto the Lord for their freedom, the Lamanites began to flee before them; and they fled even to the waters of Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.51'>Now, the Lamanites were more numerous, yea, by more than double the number of the Nephites; nevertheless, they were driven insomuch that they were gathered together in one body in the valley, upon the bank by the river Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.52'>Therefore the armies of Moroni encircled them about, yea, even on both sides of the river, for behold, on the east were the men of Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.53'>Therefore when Zerahemnah saw the men of Lehi on the east of the river Sidon, and the armies of Moroni on the west of the river Sidon, that they were encircled about by the Nephites, they were struck with terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.43.54'>Now Moroni, when he saw their terror, commanded his men that they should stop shedding their blood.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.44'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.1'>AND it came to pass that they did stop and withdrew a pace from them. And Moroni said unto Zerahemnah: Behold, Zerahemnah, that we do not desire to be men of blood. Ye know that ye are in our hands, yet we do not desire to slay you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.2'>Behold, we have not come out to battle against you that we might shed your blood for power; neither do we desire to bring any one to the yoke of bondage. But this is the very cause for which ye have come against us; yea, and ye are angry with us because of our religion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.3'>But now, ye behold that the Lord is with us; and ye behold that he has delivered you into our hands. And now I would that ye should understand that this is done unto us because of our religion and our faith in Christ. And now ye see that ye cannot destroy this our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.4'>Now ye see that this is the true faith of God; yea, ye see that God will support, and keep, and preserve us, so long as we are faithful unto him, and unto our faith, and our religion; and never will the Lord suffer that we shall be destroyed except we should fall into transgression and deny our faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.5'>And now, Zerahemnah, I command you, in the name of that all-powerful God, who has strengthened our arms that we have gained power over you, by our faith, by our religion, and by our rites of worship, and by our church, and by the sacred support which we owe to our wives and our children, by that liberty which binds us to our lands and our country; yea, and also by the maintenance of the sacred word of God, to which we owe all our happiness; and by all that is most dear unto us-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.6'>Yea, and this is not all; I command you by all the desires which ye have for life, that ye deliver up your weapons of war unto us, and we will seek not your blood, but we will spare your lives, if ye will go your way and come not again to war against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.7'>And now, if ye do not this, behold, ye are in our hands, and I will command my men that they shall fall upon you, and inflict the wounds of death in your bodies, that ye may become extinct; and then we will see who shall have power over this people; yea, we will see who shall be brought into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.8'>And now it came to pass that when Zerahemnah had heard these sayings he came forth and delivered up his sword and his cimeter, and his bow into the hands of Moroni, and said unto him: Behold, here are our weapons of war; we will deliver them up unto you, but we will not suffer ourselves to take an oath unto you, which we know that we shall break, and also our children; but take our weapons of war, and suffer that we may depart into the wilderness; otherwise we will retain our swords, and we will perish or conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.9'>Behold, we are not of your faith; we do not believe that it is God that has delivered us into your hands; but we believe that it is your cunning that has preserved you from our swords. Behold, it is your breastplates and your shields that have preserved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.10'>And now when Zerahemnah had made an end of speaking these words, Moroni returned the sword and the weapons of war, which he had received, unto Zerahemnah, saying: Behold, we will end the conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.11'>Now I cannot recall the words which I have spoken, therefore as the Lord liveth, ye shall not depart except ye depart with an oath that ye will not return again against us to war. Now as ye are in our hands we will spill your blood upon the ground, or ye shall submit to the conditions which I have proposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.12'>And now when Moroni had said these words, Zerahemnah retained his sword, and he was angry with Moroni, and he rushed forward that he might slay Moroni; but as he raised his sword, behold, one of Moroni's soldiers smote it even to the earth, and it broke by the hilt; and he also smote Zerahemnah that he took off his scalp and it fell to the earth. And Zerahemnah withdrew from before them into the midst of his soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.13'>And it came to pass that the soldier who stood by, who smote off the scalp of Zerahemnah, took up the scalp from off the ground by the hair, and laid it upon the point of his sword, and stretched it forth unto them, saying unto them with a loud voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.14'>Even as this scalp has fallen to the earth, which is the scalp of your chief, so shall ye fall to the earth except ye will deliver up your weapons of war and depart with a covenant of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.15'>Now there were many, when they heard these words and saw the scalp which was upon the sword, that were struck with fear; and many came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and entered into a covenant of peace. And as many as entered into a covenant they suffered to depart into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.16'>Now it came to pass that Zerahemnah was exceedingly wroth, and he did stir up the remainder of his soldiers to anger, to contend more powerfully against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.17'>And now Moroni was angry, because of the stubbornness of the Lamanites; therefore he commanded his people that they should fall upon them and slay them. And it came to pass that they began to slay them; yea, and the Lamanites did contend with their swords and their might.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.18'>But behold, their naked skins and their bare heads were exposed to the sharp swords of the Nephites; yea, behold they were pierced and smitten, yea, and did fall exceedingly fast before the swords of the Nephites; and they began to be swept down, even as the soldier of Moroni had prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.19'>Now Zerahemnah, when he saw that they were all about to be destroyed, cried mightily unto Moroni, promising that he would covenant and also his people with them, if they would spare the remainder of their lives, that they never would come to war again against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.20'>And it came to pass that Moroni caused that the work of death should cease again among the people. And he took the weapons of war from the Lamanites; and after they had entered into a covenant with him of peace they were suffered to depart into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.21'>Now the number of their dead was not numbered because of the greatness of the number; yea, the number of their dead was exceedingly great, both on the Nephites and on the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.22'>And it came to pass that they did cast their dead into the waters of Sidon, and they have gone forth and are buried in the depths of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.44.23'>And the armies of the Nephites, or of Moroni, returned and came to their houses and their lands.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.45'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.1'>BEHOLD, now it came to pass that the people of Nephi were exceedingly rejoiced, because the Lord had again delivered them out of the hands of their enemies; therefore they gave thanks unto the Lord their God; yea, and they did fast much and pray much, and they did worship God with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.2'>And it came to pass in the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, that Alma came unto his son Helaman and said unto him: Believest thou the words which I spake unto thee concerning those records which have been kept?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.3'>And Helaman said unto him: Yea, I believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.4'>And Alma said again: Believest thou in Jesus Christ, who shall come?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.9'>But behold, I have somewhat to prophesy unto thee; but what I prophesy unto thee ye shall not make known; yea, what I prophesy unto thee shall not be made known, even until the prophecy is fulfilled; therefore write the words which I shall say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.10'>And these are the words: Behold, I perceive that this very people, the Nephites, according to the spirit of revelation which is in me, in four hundred years from the time that Jesus Christ shall manifest himself unto them, shall dwindle in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.11'>Yea, and then shall they see wars and pestilences, yea, famines and bloodshed, even until the people of Nephi shall become extinct-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.12'>Yea, and this because they shall dwindle in unbelief and fall into the works of darkness, and lasciviousness, and all manner of iniquities; yea, I say unto you, that because they shall sin against so great light and knowledge, yea, I say unto you, that from that day, even the fourth generation shall not all pass away before this great iniquity shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.13'>And when that great day cometh, behold, the time very soon cometh that those who are now, or the seed of those who are now numbered among the people of Nephi, shall no more be numbered among the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.14'>But whosoever remaineth, and is not destroyed in that great and dreadful day, shall be numbered among the Lamanites, and shall become like unto them, all, save it be a few who shall be called the disciples of the Lord; and them shall the Lamanites pursue even until they shall become extinct. And now, because of iniquity, this prophecy shall be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.15'>And now it came to pass that after Alma had said these things to Helaman, he blessed him, and also his other sons; and he also blessed the earth for the righteous' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.16'>And he said: Thus saith the Lord God-Cursed shall be the land, yea, this land, unto every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, unto destruction, which do wickedly, when they are fully ripe; and as I have said so shall it be; for this is the cursing and the blessing of God upon the land, for the Lord cannot look upon sin with the least degree of allowance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.17'>And now, when Alma had said these words he blessed the church, yea, all those who should stand fast in the faith from that time henceforth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.18'>And when Alma had done this he departed out of the land of Zarahemla, as if to go into the land of Melek. And it came to pass that he was never heard of more; as to his death or burial we know not of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.19'>Behold, this we know, that he was a righteous man; and the saying went abroad in the church that he was taken up by the Spirit, or buried by the hand of the Lord, even as Moses.

        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.22'>Therefore, Helaman and his brethren went forth to establish the church again in all the land, yea, in every city throughout all the land which was possessed by the people of Nephi. And it came to pass that they did appoint priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.23'>And now it came to pass that after Helaman and his brethren had appointed priests and teachers over the churches that there arose a dissension among them, and they would not give heed to the words of Helaman and his brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.45.24'>But they grew proud, being lifted up in their hearts, because of their exceedingly great riches; therefore they grew rich in their own eyes, and would not give heed to their words, to walk uprightly before God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.3'>Now the leader of those who were wroth against their brethren was a large and a strong man; and his name was Amalickiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.4'>And Amalickiah was desirous to be a king; and those people who were wroth were also desirous that he should be their king; and they were the greater part of them the lower judges of the land, and they were seeking for power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.5'>And they had been led by the flatteries of Amalickiah, that if they would support him and establish him to be their king that he would make them rulers over the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.6'>Thus they were led away by Amalickiah to dissensions, notwithstanding the preaching of Helaman and his brethren, yea, notwithstanding their exceedingly great care over the church, for they were high priests over the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.7'>And there were many in the church who believed in the flattering words of Amalickiah, therefore they dissented even from the church; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi exceedingly precarious and dangerous, notwithstanding their great victory which they had had over the Lamanites, and their great rejoicings which they had had because of their deliverance by the hand of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.8'>Thus we see how quick the children of men do forget the Lord their God, yea, how quick to do iniquity, and to be led away by the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.9'>Yea, and we also see the great wickedness one very wicked man can cause to take place among the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.10'>Yea, we see that Amalickiah, because he was a man of cunning device and a man of many flattering words, that he led away the hearts of many people to do wickedly; yea, and to seek to destroy the church of God, and to destroy the foundation of liberty which God had granted unto them, or which blessing God had sent upon the face of the land for the righteous' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.11'>And now it came to pass that when Moroni, who was the chief commander of the armies of the Nephites, had heard of these dissensions, he was angry with Amalickiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.12'>And it came to pass that he rent his coat; and he took a piece thereof, and wrote upon it-In memory of our God, our religion, and freedom, and our peace, our wives, and our children-and he fastened it upon the end of a pole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.13'>And he fastened on his head-plate, and his breastplate, and his shields, and girded on his armor about his loins; and he took the pole, which had on the end thereof his rent coat, (and he called it the title of liberty) and he bowed himself to the earth, and he prayed mightily unto his God for the blessings of liberty to rest upon his brethren, so long as there should a band of Christians remain to possess the land-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.14'>For thus were all the true believers of Christ, who belonged to the church of God, called by those who did not belong to the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.15'>And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those who were true believers in Christ took upon them, gladly, the name of Christ, or Christians as they were called, because of their belief in Christ who should come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.16'>And therefore, at this time, Moroni prayed that the cause of the Christians, and the freedom of the land might be favored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.17'>And it came to pass that when he had poured out his soul to God, he named all the land which was south of the land Desolation, yea, and in fine, all the land, both on the north and on the south-A chosen land, and the land of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.18'>And he said: Surely God shall not suffer that we, who are despised because we take upon us the name of Christ, shall be trodden down and destroyed, until we bring it upon us by our own transgressions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.19'>And when Moroni had said these words, he went forth among the people, waving the rent part of his garment in the air, that all might see the writing which he had written upon the rent part, and crying with a loud voice, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.20'>Behold, whosoever will maintain this title upon the land, let them come forth in the strength of the Lord, and enter into a covenant that they will maintain their rights, and their religion, that the Lord God may bless them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.21'>And it came to pass that when Moroni had proclaimed these words, behold, the people came running together with their armor girded about their loins, rending their garments in token, or as a covenant, that they would not forsake the Lord their God; or, in other words, if they should transgress the commandments of God, or fall into transgression, and be ashamed to take upon them the name of Christ, the Lord should rend them even as they had rent their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.22'>Now this was the covenant which they made, and they cast their garments at the feet of Moroni, saying: We covenant with our God, that we shall be destroyed, even as our brethren in the land northward, if we shall fall into transgression; yea, he may cast us at the feet of our enemies, even as we have cast our garments at thy feet to be trodden under foot, if we shall fall into transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.23'>Moroni said unto them: Behold, we are a remnant of the seed of Jacob; yea, we are a remnant of the seed of Joseph, whose coat was rent by his brethren into many pieces; yea, and now behold, let us remember to keep the commandments of God, or our garments shall be rent by our brethren, and we be cast into prison, or be sold, or be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.24'>Yea, let us preserve our liberty as a remnant of Joseph; yea, let us remember the words of Jacob, before his death, for behold, he saw that a part of the remnant of the coat of Joseph was preserved and had not decayed. And he said-Even as this remnant of garment of my son hath been preserved, so shall a remnant of the seed of my son be preserved by the hand of God, and be taken unto himself, while the remainder of the seed of Joseph shall perish, even as the remnant of his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.25'>Now behold, this giveth my soul sorrow; nevertheless, my soul hath joy in my son, because of that part of his seed which shall be taken unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.26'>Now behold, this was the language of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.27'>And now who knoweth but what the remnant of the seed of Joseph, which shall perish as his garment, are those who have dissented from us? Yea, and even it shall be ourselves if we do not stand fast in the faith of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.28'>And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words he went forth, and also sent forth in all the parts of the land where there were dissensions, and gathered together all the people who were desirous to maintain their liberty, to stand against Amalickiah and those who had dissented, who were called Amalickiahites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.29'>And it came to pass that when Amalickiah saw that the people of Moroni were more numerous than the Amalickiahites-and he also saw that his people were doubtful concerning the justice of the cause in which they had undertaken-therefore, fearing that he should not gain the point, he took those of his people who would and departed into the land of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.30'>Now Moroni thought it was not expedient that the Lamanites should have any more strength; therefore he thought to cut off the people of Amalickiah, or to take them and bring them back, and put Amalickiah to death; yea, for he knew that he would stir up the Lamanites to anger against them, and cause them to come to battle against them; and this he knew that Amalickiah would do that he might obtain his purposes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.31'>Therefore Moroni thought it was expedient that he should take his armies, who had gathered themselves together, and armed themselves, and entered into a covenant to keep the peace-and it came to pass that he took his army and marched out with his tents into the wilderness, to cut off the course of Amalickiah in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.32'>And it came to pass that he did according to his desires, and marched forth into the wilderness, and headed the armies of Amalickiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.33'>And it came to pass that Amalickiah fled with a small number of his men, and the remainder were delivered up into the hands of Moroni and were taken back into the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.34'>Now, Moroni being a man who was appointed by the chief judges and the voice of the people, therefore he had power according to his will with the armies of the Nephites, to establish and to exercise authority over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.35'>And it came to pass that whomsoever of the Amalickiahites that would not enter into a covenant to support the cause of freedom, that they might maintain a free government, he caused to be put to death; and there were but few who denied the covenant of freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.36'>And it came to pass also, that he caused the title of liberty to be hoisted upon every tower which was in all the land, which was possessed by the Nephites; and thus Moroni planted the standard of liberty among the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.37'>And they began to have peace again in the land; and thus they did maintain peace in the land until nearly the *end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.38'>And Helaman and the high priests did also maintain order in the church; yea, even for the space of four years did they have much peace and rejoicing in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.39'>And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly believing that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ; thus they went out of the world rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.40'>And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons of the year were very frequent in the land-but not so much so with fevers, because of the excellent qualities of the many plants and roots which God had prepared to remove the cause of diseases, to which men were subject by the nature of the climate-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.46.41'>But there were many who died with old age; and those who died in the faith of Christ are happy in him, as we must needs suppose.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.1'>NOW we will return in our record to Amalickiah and those who had fled with him into the wilderness; for, behold, he had taken those who went with him, and went up in the land of Nephi among the Lamanites, and did stir up the Lamanites to anger against the people of Nephi, insomuch that the king of the Lamanites sent a proclamation throughout all his land, among all his people, that they should gather themselves together again to go to battle against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.2'>And it came to pass that when the proclamation had gone forth among them they were exceedingly afraid; yea, they feared to displease the king, and they also feared to go to battle against the Nephites lest they should lose their lives. And it came to pass that they would not, or the more part of them would not, obey the commandments of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.3'>And now it came to pass that the king was wroth because of their disobedience; therefore he gave Amalickiah the command of that part of his army which was obedient unto his commands, and commanded him that he should go forth and compel them to arms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.4'>Now behold, this was the desire of Amalickiah; for he being a very subtle man to do evil therefore he laid the plan in his heart to dethrone the king of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.5'>And now he had got the command of those parts of the Lamanites who were in favor of the king; and he sought to gain favor of those who were not obedient; therefore he went forward to the place which was called Onidah, for thither had all the Lamanites fled; for they discovered the army coming, and, supposing that they were coming to destroy them, therefore they fled to Onidah, to the place of arms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.6'>And they had appointed a man to be a king and a leader over them, being fixed in their minds with a determined resolution that they would not be subjected to go against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.7'>And it came to pass that they had gathered themselves together upon the top of the mount which was called Antipas, in preparation to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.8'>Now it was not Amalickiah's intention to give them battle according to the commandments of the king; but behold, it was his intention to gain favor with the armies of the Lamanites, that he might place himself at their head and dethrone the king and take possession of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.9'>And behold, it came to pass that he caused his army to pitch their tents in the valley which was near the mount Antipas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.10'>And it came to pass that when it was night he sent a secret embassy into the mount Antipas, desiring that the leader of those who were upon the mount, whose name was Lehonti, that he should come down to the foot of the mount, for he desired to speak with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.11'>And it came to pass that when Lehonti received the message he durst not go down to the foot of the mount. And it came to pass that Amalickiah sent again the second time, desiring him to come down. And it came to pass that Lehonti would not; and he sent again the third time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.12'>And it came to pass that when Amalickiah found that he could not get Lehonti to come down off from the mount, he went up into the mount, nearly to Lehonti's camp; and he sent again the fourth time his message unto Lehonti, desiring that he would come down, and that he would bring his guards with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.13'>And it came to pass that when Lehonti had come down with his guards to Amalickiah, that Amalickiah desired him to come down with his army in the night-time, and surround those men in their camps over whom the king had given him command, and that he would deliver them up into Lehonti's hands, if he would make him (Amalickiah) a second leader over the whole army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.14'>And it came to pass that Lehonti came down with his men and surrounded the men of Amalickiah, so that before they awoke at the dawn of day they were surrounded by the armies of Lehonti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.15'>And it came to pass that when they saw that they were surrounded, they plead with Amalickiah that he would suffer them to fall in with their brethren, that they might not be destroyed. Now this was the very thing which Amalickiah desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.16'>And it came to pass that he delivered his men, contrary to the commands of the king. Now this was the thing that Amalickiah desired, that he might accomplish his designs in dethroning the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.17'>Now it was the custom among the Lamanites, if their chief leader was killed, to appoint the second leader to be their chief leader.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.18'>And it came to pass that Amalickiah caused that one of his servants should administer poison by degrees to Lehonti, that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.19'>Now, when Lehonti was dead, the Lamanites appointed Amalickiah to be their leader and their chief commander.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.20'>And it came to pass that Amalickiah marched with his armies (for he had gained his desires) to the land of Nephi, to the city of Nephi, which was the chief city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.21'>And the king came out to meet him with his guards, for he supposed that Amalickiah had fulfilled his commands, and that Amalickiah had gathered together so great an army to go against the Nephites to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.22'>But behold, as the king came out to meet him Amalickiah caused that his servants should go forth to meet the king. And they went and bowed themselves before the king, as if to reverence him because of his greatness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.23'>And it came to pass that the king put forth his hand to raise them, as was the custom with the Lamanites, as a token of peace, which custom they had taken from the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.24'>And it came to pass that when he had raised the first from the ground, behold he stabbed the king to the heart; and he fell to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.25'>Now the servants of the king fled; and the servants of Amalickiah raised a cry, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.26'>Behold, the servants of the king have stabbed him to the heart, and he has fallen and they have fled; behold, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.27'>And it came to pass that Amalickiah commanded that his armies should march forth and see what had happened to the king; and when they had come to the spot, and found the king lying in his gore, Amalickiah pretended to be wroth, and said: Whosoever loved the king, let him go forth, and pursue his servants that they may be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.28'>And it came to pass that all they who loved the king, when they heard these words, came forth and pursued after the servants of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.29'>Now when the servants of the king saw an army pursuing after them, they were frightened again, and fled into the wilderness, and came over into the land of Zarahemla and joined the people of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.30'>And the army which pursued after them returned, having pursued after them in vain; and thus Amalickiah, by his fraud, gained the hearts of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.31'>And it came to pass on the morrow he entered the city Nephi with his armies, and took possession of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.32'>And now it came to pass that the queen, when she had heard that the king was slain-for Amalickiah had sent an embassy to the queen informing her that the king had been slain by his servants, that he had pursued them with his army, but it was in vain, and they had made their escape-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.33'>Therefore, when the queen had received this message she sent unto Amalickiah, desiring him that he would spare the people of the city; and she also desired him that he should come in unto her; and she also desired him that he should bring witnesses with him to testify concerning the death of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.34'>And it came to pass that Amalickiah took the same servant that slew the king, and all them who were with him, and went in unto the queen, unto the place where she sat; and they all testified unto her that the king was slain by his own servants; and they said also: They have fled; does not this testify against them? And thus they satisfied the queen concerning the death of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.35'>And it came to pass that Amalickiah sought the favor of the queen, and took her unto him to wife; and thus by his fraud, and by the assistance of his cunning servants, he obtained the kingdom; yea, he was acknowledged king throughout all the land, among all the people of the Lamanites, who were composed of the Lamanites and the Lemuelites and the Ishmaelites, and all the dissenters of the Nephites, from the reign of Nephi down to the present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.47.36'>Now these dissenters, having the same instruction and the same information of the Nephites, yea, having been instructed in the same knowledge of the Lord, nevertheless, it is strange to relate, not long after their dissensions they became more hardened and impenitent, and more wild, wicked and ferocious than the Lamanites-drinking in with the traditions of the Lamanites; giving way to indolence, and all manner of lasciviousness; yea, entirely forgetting the Lord their God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.48'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.1'>AND now it came to pass that, as soon as Amalickiah had obtained the kingdom he began to inspire the hearts of the Lamanites against the people of Nephi; yea, he did appoint men to speak unto the Lamanites from their towers, against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.2'>And thus he did inspire their hearts against the Nephites, insomuch that in the *latter end of the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges, he having accomplished his designs thus far, yea, having been made king over the Lamanites, he sought also to reign over all the land, yea, and all the people who were in the land, the Nephites as well as the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.3'>Therefore he had accomplished his design, for he had hardened the hearts of the Lamanites and blinded their minds, and stirred them up to anger, insomuch that he had gathered together a numerous host to go to battle against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.4'>For he was determined, because of the greatness of the number of his people, to overpower the Nephites and to bring them into bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.5'>And thus he did appoint chief captains of the Zoramites, they being the most acquainted with the strength of the Nephites, and their places of resort, and the weakest parts of their cities; therefore he appointed them to be chief captains over his armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.6'>And it came to pass that they took their camp, and moved forth toward the land of Zarahemla in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.7'>Now it came to pass that while Amalickiah had thus been obtaining power by fraud and deceit, Moroni, on the other hand, had been preparing the minds of the people to be faithful unto the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.8'>Yea, he had been strengthening the armies of the Nephites, and erecting small forts, or places of resort; throwing up banks of earth round about to enclose his armies, and also building walls of stone to encircle them about, round about their cities and the borders of their lands; yea, all round about the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.9'>And in their weakest fortifications he did place the greater number of men; and thus he did fortify and strengthen the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.10'>And thus he was preparing to support their liberty, their lands, their wives, and their children, and their peace, and that they might live unto the Lord their God, and that they might maintain that which was called by their enemies the cause of Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.11'>And Moroni was a strong and a mighty man; he was a man of a perfect understanding; yea, a man that did not delight in bloodshed; a man whose soul did joy in the liberty and the freedom of his country, and his brethren from bondage and slavery;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.12'>Yea, a man whose heart did swell with thanksgiving to his God, for the many privileges and blessings which he bestowed upon his people; a man who did labor exceedingly for the welfare and safety of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.13'>Yea, and he was a man who was firm in the faith of Christ, and he had sworn with an oath to defend his people, his rights, and his country, and his religion, even to the loss of his blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.14'>Now the Nephites were taught to defend themselves against their enemies, even to the shedding of blood if it were necessary; yea, and they were also taught never to give an offense, yea, and never to raise the sword except it were against an enemy, except it were to preserve their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.15'>And this was their faith, that by so doing God would prosper them in the land, or in other words, if they were faithful in keeping the commandments of God that he would prosper them in the land; yea, warn them to flee, or to prepare for war, according to their danger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.16'>And also, that God would make it known unto them whither they should go to defend themselves against their enemies, and by so doing, the Lord would deliver them; and this was the faith of Moroni, and his heart did glory in it; not in the shedding of blood but in doing good, in preserving his people, yea, in keeping the commandments of God, yea, and resisting iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.17'>Yea, verily, verily I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni, behold, the very powers of hell would have been shaken forever; yea, the devil would never have power over the hearts of the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.18'>Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah, yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah, yea, and also Alma and his sons, for they were all men of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.19'>Now behold, Helaman and his brethren were no less serviceable unto the people than was Moroni; for they did preach the word of God, and they did baptize unto repentance all men whosoever would hearken unto their words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.20'>And thus they went forth, and the people did humble themselves because of their words, insomuch that they were highly favored of the Lord, and thus they were free from wars and contentions among themselves, yea, even for the space of four years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.21'>But, as I have said, in the latter end of the nineteenth year, yea, notwithstanding their peace amongst themselves, they were compelled reluctantly to contend with their brethren, the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.22'>Yea, and in fine, their wars never did cease for the space of many years with the Lamanites, notwithstanding their much reluctance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.23'>Now, they were sorry to take up arms against the Lamanites, because they did not delight in the shedding of blood; yea, and this was not all-they were sorry to be the means of sending so many of their brethren out of this world into an eternal world, unprepared to meet their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.24'>Nevertheless, they could not suffer to lay down their lives, that their wives and their children should be massacred by the barbarous cruelty of those who were once their brethren, yea, and had dissented from their church, and had left them and had gone to destroy them by joining the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.48.25'>Yea, they could not bear that their brethren should rejoice over the blood of the Nephites, so long as there were any who should keep the commandments of God, for the promise of the Lord was, if they should keep his commandments they should prosper in the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.49'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.1'>AND now it came to pass in the *eleventh month of the nineteenth year, on the tenth day of the month, the armies of the Lamanites were seen approaching towards the land of Ammonihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.2'>And behold, the city had been rebuilt, and Moroni had stationed an army by the borders of the city, and they had cast up dirt round about to shield them from the arrows and the stones of the Lamanites; for behold, they fought with stones and with arrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.3'>Behold, I said that the city of Ammonihah had been rebuilt. I say unto you, yea, that it was in part rebuilt; and because the Lamanites had destroyed it once because of the iniquity of the people, they supposed that it would again become an easy prey for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.4'>But behold, how great was their disappointment; for behold, the Nephites had dug up a ridge of earth round about them, which was so high that the Lamanites could not cast their stones and their arrows at them that they might take effect, neither could they come upon them save it was by their place of entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.5'>Now at this time the chief captains of the Lamanites were astonished exceedingly, because of the wisdom of the Nephites in preparing their places of security.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.6'>Now the leaders of the Lamanites had supposed, because of the greatness of their numbers, yea, they supposed that they should be privileged to come upon them as they had hitherto done; yea, and they had also prepared themselves with shields, and with breastplates; and they had also prepared themselves with garments of skins, yea, very thick garments to cover their nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.7'>And being thus prepared they supposed that they should easily overpower and subject their brethren to the yoke of bondage, or slay and massacre them according to their pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.8'>But behold, to their uttermost astonishment, they were prepared for them, in a manner which never had been known among the children of Lehi. Now they were prepared for the Lamanites, to battle after the manner of the instructions of Moroni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.9'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites, or the Amalickiahites, were exceedingly astonished at their manner of preparation for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.10'>Now, if king Amalickiah had come down out of the land of Nephi, at the head of his army, perhaps he would have caused the Lamanites to have attacked the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah; for behold, he did care not for the blood of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.11'>But behold, Amalickiah did not come down himself to battle. And behold, his chief captains durst not attack the Nephites at the city of Ammonihah, for Moroni had altered the management of affairs among the Nephites, insomuch that the Lamanites were disappointed in their places of retreat and they could not come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.12'>Therefore they retreated into the wilderness, and took their camp and marched towards the land of Noah, supposing that to be the next best place for them to come against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.13'>For they knew not that Moroni had fortified, or had built forts of security, for every city in all the land round about; therefore, they marched forward to the land of Noah with a firm determination; yea, their chief captains came forward and took an oath that they would destroy the people of that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.14'>But behold, to their astonishment, the city of Noah, which had hitherto been a weak place, had now, by the means of Moroni, become strong, yea, even to exceed the strength of the city Ammonihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.15'>And now, behold, this was wisdom in Moroni; for he had supposed that they would be frightened at the city Ammonihah; and as the city of Noah had hitherto been the weakest part of the land, therefore they would march thither to battle; and thus it was according to his desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.16'>And behold, Moroni had appointed Lehi to be chief captain over the men of that city; and it was that same Lehi who fought with the Lamanites in the valley on the east of the river Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.17'>And now behold it came to pass, that when the Lamanites had found that Lehi commanded the city they were again disappointed, for they feared Lehi exceedingly; nevertheless their chief captains had sworn with an oath to attack the city; therefore, they brought up their armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.18'>Now behold, the Lamanites could not get into their forts of security by any other way save by the entrance, because of the highness of the bank which had been thrown up, and the depth of the ditch which had been dug round about, save it were by the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.19'>And thus were the Nephites prepared to destroy all such as should attempt to climb up to enter the fort by any other way, by casting over stones and arrows at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.20'>Thus they were prepared, yea, a body of their strongest men, with their swords and their slings, to smite down all who should attempt to come into their place of security by the place of entrance; and thus were they prepared to defend themselves against the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.21'>And it came to pass that the captains of the Lamanites brought up their armies before the place of entrance, and began to contend with the Nephites, to get into their place of security; but behold, they were driven back from time to time, insomuch that they were slain with an immense slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.22'>Now when they found that they could not obtain power over the Nephites by the pass, they began to dig down their banks of earth that they might obtain a pass to their armies, that they might have an equal chance to fight; but behold, in these attempts they were swept off by the stones and arrows which were thrown at them; and instead of filling up their ditches by pulling down the banks of earth, they were filled up in a measure with their dead and wounded bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.23'>Thus the Nephites had all power over their enemies; and thus the Lamanites did attempt to destroy the Nephites until their chief captains were all slain; yea, and more than a thousand of the Lamanites were slain; while, on the other hand, there was not a single soul of the Nephites which was slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.24'>There were about fifty who were wounded, who had been exposed to the arrows of the Lamanites through the pass, but they were shielded by their shields, and their breastplates, and their head-plates, insomuch that their wounds were upon their legs, many of which were very severe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.25'>And it came to pass, that when the Lamanites saw that their chief captains were all slain they fled into the wilderness. And it came to pass that they returned to the land of Nephi, to inform their king, Amalickiah, who was a Nephite by birth, concerning their great loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.26'>And it came to pass that he was exceedingly angry with his people, because he had not obtained his desire over the Nephites; he had not subjected them to the yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.27'>Yea, he was exceedingly wroth, and he did curse God, and also Moroni, swearing with an oath that he would drink his blood; and this because Moroni had kept the commandments of God in preparing for the safety of his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.28'>And it came to pass, that on the other hand, the people of Nephi did thank the Lord their God, because of his matchless power in delivering them from the hands of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.29'>And thus ended the nineteenth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.49.30'>Yea, and there was continual peace among them, and exceedingly great prosperity in the church because of their heed and diligence which they gave unto the word of God, which was declared unto them by Helaman, and Shiblon, and Corianton, and Ammon and his brethren, yea, and by all those who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach among the people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.50'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.1'>AND now it came to pass that Moroni did not stop making preparations for war, or to defend his people against the Lamanites; for he caused that his armies should commence in the *commencement of the twentieth year of the reign of the judges, that they should commence in digging up heaps of earth round about all the cities, throughout all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.2'>And upon the top of these ridges of earth he caused that there should be timbers, yea, works of timbers built up to the height of a man, round about the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.3'>And he caused that upon those works of timbers there should be a frame of pickets built upon the timbers round about; and they were strong and high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.4'>And he caused towers to be erected that overlooked those works of pickets, and he caused places of security to be built upon those towers, that the stones and the arrows of the Lamanites could not hurt them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.5'>And they were prepared that they could cast stones from the top thereof, according to their pleasure and their strength, and slay him who should attempt to approach near the walls of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.6'>Thus Moroni did prepare strongholds against the coming of their enemies, round about every city in all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.7'>And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his armies should go forth into the east wilderness; yea, and they went forth and drove all the Lamanites who were in the east wilderness into their own lands, which were south of the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.8'>And the land of Nephi did run in a straight course from the east sea to the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.9'>And it came to pass that when Moroni had driven all the Lamanites out of the east wilderness, which was north of the lands of their own possessions, he caused that the inhabitants who were in the land of Zarahemla and in the land round about should go forth into the east wilderness, even to the borders by the seashore, and possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.10'>And he also placed armies on the south, in the borders of their possessions, and caused them to erect fortifications that they might secure their armies and their people from the hands of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.11'>And thus he cut off all the strongholds of the Lamanites in the east wilderness, yea, and also on the west, fortifying the line between the Nephites and the Lamanites, between the land of Zarahemla and the land of Nephi, from the west sea, running by the head of the river Sidon-the Nephites possessing all the land northward, yea, even all the land which was northward of the land Bountiful, according to their pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.12'>Thus Moroni, with his armies, which did increase daily because of the assurance of protection which his works did bring forth unto them, did seek to cut off the strength and the power of the Lamanites from off the lands of their possessions, that they should have no power upon the lands of their possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.13'>And it came to pass that the Nephites began the foundation of a city, and they called the name of the city Moroni; and it was by the east sea; and it was on the south by the line of the possessions of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.14'>And they also began a foundation for a city between the city of Moroni and the city of Aaron, joining the borders of Aaron and Moroni; and they called the name of the city, or the land, Nephihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.15'>And they also began in that same year to build many cities on the north, one in a particular manner which they called Lehi, which was in the north by the borders of the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.16'>And thus ended the twentieth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.17'>And in these prosperous circumstances were the people of Nephi in the *commencement of the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.18'>And they did prosper exceedingly, and they became exceedingly rich; yea, and they did multiply and wax strong in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.19'>And thus we see how merciful and just are all the dealings of the Lord, to the fulfilling of all his words unto the children of men; yea, we can behold that his words are verified, even at this time, which he spake unto Lehi, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.20'>Blessed art thou and thy children; and they shall be blessed, inasmuch as they shall keep my commandments they shall prosper in the land. But remember, inasmuch as they will not keep my commandments they shall be cut off from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.21'>And we see that these promises have been verified to the people of Nephi; for it has been their quarrelings and their contentions, yea, their murderings, and their plunderings, their idolatry, their whoredoms, and their abominations, which were among themselves, which brought upon them their wars and their destructions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.22'>And those who were faithful in keeping the commandments of the Lord were delivered at all times, whilst thousands of their wicked brethren have been consigned to bondage, or to perish by the sword, or to dwindle in unbelief, and mingle with the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.23'>But behold there never was a happier time among the people of Nephi, since the days of Nephi, than in the days of Moroni, yea, even at this time, in the twenty and first year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.24'>And it came to pass that the twenty and second year of the reign of the judges also ended in peace; yea, and also the twenty and third year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.25'>And it came to pass that in the *commencement of the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges, there would also have been peace among the people of Nephi had it not been for a contention which took place among them concerning the land of Lehi, and the land of Morianton, which joined upon the borders of Lehi; both of which were on the borders by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.26'>For behold, the people who possessed the land of Morianton did claim a part of the land of Lehi; therefore there began to be a warm contention between them, insomuch that the people of Morianton took up arms against their brethren, and they were determined by the sword to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.27'>But behold, the people who possessed the land of Lehi fled to the camp of Moroni, and appealed unto him for assistance; for behold they were not in the wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.28'>And it came to pass that when the people of Morianton, who were led by a man whose name was Morianton, found that the people of Lehi had fled to the camp of Moroni, they were exceedingly fearful lest the army of Moroni should come upon them and destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.29'>Therefore, Morianton put it into their hearts that they should flee to the land which was northward, which was covered with large bodies of water, and take possession of the land which was northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.30'>And behold, they would have carried this plan into effect, (which would have been a cause to have been lamented) but behold, Morianton being a man of much passion, therefore he was angry with one of his maid servants, and he fell upon her and beat her much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.31'>And it came to pass that she fled, and came over to the camp of Moroni, and told Moroni all things concerning the matter, and also concerning their intentions to flee into the land northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.32'>Now behold, the people who were in the land Bountiful, or rather Moroni, feared that they would hearken to the words of Morianton and unite with his people, and thus he would obtain possession of those parts of the land, which would lay a foundation for serious consequences among the people of Nephi, yea, which consequences would lead to the overthrow of their liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.33'>Therefore Moroni sent an army, with their camp, to head the people of Morianton, to stop their flight into the land northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.34'>And it came to pass that they did not head them until they had come to the borders of the land Desolation; and there they did head them, by the narrow pass which led by the sea into the land northward, yea, by the sea, on the west and on the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.35'>And it came to pass that the army which was sent by Moroni, which was led by a man whose name was Teancum, did meet the people of Morianton; and so stubborn were the people of Morianton, (being inspired by his wickedness and his flattering words) that a battle commenced between them, in the which Teancum did slay Morianton and defeat his army, and took them prisoners, and returned to the camp of Moroni. And thus ended the twenty and fourth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.36'>And thus were the people of Morianton brought back. And upon their covenanting to keep the peace they were restored to the land of Morianton, and a union took place between them and the people of Lehi; and they were also restored to their lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.37'>And it came to pass that in the same year that the people of Nephi had peace restored unto them, that Nephihah, the second chief judge, died, having filled the judgment-seat with perfect uprightness before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.38'>Nevertheless, he had refused Alma to take possession of those records and those things which were esteemed by Alma and his fathers to be most sacred; therefore Alma had conferred them upon his son, Helaman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.39'>Behold, it came to pass that the son of Nephihah was appointed to fill the judgment-seat, in the stead of his father; yea, he was appointed chief judge and governor over the people, with an oath and sacred ordinance to judge righteously, and to keep the peace and the freedom of the people, and to grant unto them their sacred privileges to worship the Lord their God, yea, to support and maintain the cause of God all his days, and to bring the wicked to justice according to their crime.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.50.40'>Now behold, his name was Pahoran. And Pahoran did fill the seat of his father, and did commence his reign in the end of the twenty and fourth year, over the people of Nephi.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.1'>AND now it came to pass in the *commencement of the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, they having established peace between the people of Lehi and the people of Morianton concerning their lands, and having commenced the twenty and fifth year in peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.2'>Nevertheless, they did not long maintain an entire peace in the land, for there began to be a contention among the people concerning the chief judge Pahoran; for behold, there were a part of the people who desired that a few particular points of the law should be altered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.3'>But behold, Pahoran would not alter nor suffer the law to be altered; therefore, he did not hearken to those who had sent in their voices with their petitions concerning the altering of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.4'>Therefore, those who were desirous that the law should be altered were angry with him, and desired that he should no longer be chief judge over the land; therefore there arose a warm dispute concerning the matter, but not unto bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.5'>And it came to pass that those who were desirous that Pahoran should be dethroned from the judgment-seat were called king-men, for they were desirous that the law should be altered in a manner to overthrow the free government and to establish a king over the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.6'>And those who were desirous that Pahoran should remain chief judge over the land took upon them the name of freemen; and thus was the division among them, for the freemen had sworn or covenanted to maintain their rights and the privileges of their religion by a free government.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.7'>And it came to pass that this matter of their contention was settled by the voice of the people. And it came to pass that the voice of the people came in favor of the freemen, and Pahoran retained the judgment-seat, which caused much rejoicing among the brethren of Pahoran and also many of the people of liberty, who also put the king-men to silence, that they durst not oppose but were obliged to maintain the cause of freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.8'>Now those who were in favor of kings were those of high birth, and they sought to be kings; and they were supported by those who sought power and authority over the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.9'>But behold, this was a critical time for such contentions to be among the people of Nephi; for behold, Amalickiah had again stirred up the hearts of the people of the Lamanites against the people of the Nephites, and he was gathering together soldiers from all parts of his land, and arming them, and preparing for war with all diligence; for he had sworn to drink the blood of Moroni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.10'>But behold, we shall see that his promise which he made was rash; nevertheless, he did prepare himself and his armies to come to battle against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.11'>Now his armies were not so great as they had hitherto been, because of the many thousands who had been slain by the hand of the Nephites; but notwithstanding their great loss, Amalickiah had gathered together a wonderfully great army, insomuch that he feared not to come down to the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.12'>Yea, even Amalickiah did himself come down, at the head of the Lamanites. And it was in the twenty and fifth year of the reign of the judges; and it was at the same time that they had begun to settle the affairs of their contentions concerning the chief judge, Pahoran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.13'>And it came to pass that when the men who were called king-men had heard that the Lamanites were coming down to battle against them, they were glad in their hearts; and they refused to take up arms, for they were so wroth with the chief judge, and also with the people of liberty, that they would not take up arms to defend their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.14'>And it came to pass that when Moroni saw this, and also saw that the Lamanites were coming into the borders of the land, he was exceedingly wroth because of the stubbornness of those people whom he had labored with so much diligence to preserve; yea, he was exceedingly wroth; his soul was filled with anger against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.15'>And it came to pass that he sent a petition, with the voice of the people, unto the governor of the land, desiring that he should read it, and give him (Moroni) power to compel those dissenters to defend their country or to put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.16'>For it was his first care to put an end to such contentions and dissensions among the people; for behold, this had been hitherto a cause of all their destruction. And it came to pass that it was granted according to the voice of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.17'>And it came to pass that Moroni commanded that his army should go against those king-men, to pull down their pride and their nobility and level them with the earth, or they should take up arms and support the cause of liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.18'>And it came to pass that the armies did march forth against them; and they did pull down their pride and their nobility, insomuch that as they did lift their weapons of war to fight against the men of Moroni they were hewn down and leveled to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.19'>And it came to pass that there were four thousand of those dissenters who were hewn down by the sword; and those of their leaders who were not slain in battle were taken and cast into prison, for there was no time for their trials at this period.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.20'>And the remainder of those dissenters, rather than be smitten down to the earth by the sword, yielded to the standard of liberty, and were compelled to hoist the title of liberty upon their towers, and in their cities, and to take up arms in defence of their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.21'>And thus Moroni put an end to those king-men, that there were not any known by the appellation of king-men; and thus he put an end to the stubbornness and the pride of those people who professed the blood of nobility; but they were brought down to humble themselves like unto their brethren, and to fight valiantly for their freedom from bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.22'>Behold, it came to pass that while Moroni was thus breaking down the wars and contentions among his own people, and subjecting them to peace and civilization, and making regulations to prepare for war against the Lamanites, behold, the Lamanites had come into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.23'>And it came to pass that the Nephites were not sufficiently strong in the city of Moroni; therefore Amalickiah did drive them, slaying many. And it came to pass that Amalickiah took possession of the city, yea, possession of all their fortifications.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.24'>And those who fled out of the city of Moroni came to the city of Nephihah; and also the people of the city of Lehi gathered themselves together, and made preparations and were ready to receive the Lamanites to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.25'>But it came to pass that Amalickiah would not suffer the Lamanites to go against the city of Nephihah to battle, but kept them down by the seashore, leaving men in every city to maintain and defend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.26'>And thus he went on, taking possession of many cities, the city of Nephihah, and the city of Lehi, and the city of Morianton, and the city of Omner, and the city of Gid, and the city of Mulek, all of which were on the east borders by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.27'>And thus had the Lamanites obtained, by the cunning of Amalickiah, so many cities, by their numberless hosts, all of which were strongly fortified after the manner of the fortifications of Moroni; all of which afforded strongholds for the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.28'>And it came to pass that they marched to the borders of the land Bountiful, driving the Nephites before them and slaying many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.29'>But it came to pass that they were met by Teancum, who had slain Morianton and had headed his people in his flight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.30'>And it came to pass that he headed Amalickiah also, as he was marching forth with his numerous army that he might take possession of the land Bountiful, and also the land northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.31'>But behold he met with a disappointment by being repulsed by Teancum and his men, for they were great warriors; for every man of Teancum did exceed the Lamanites in their strength and in their skill of war, insomuch that they did gain advantage over the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.32'>And it came to pass that they did harass them, insomuch that they did slay them even until it was dark. And it came to pass that Teancum and his men did pitch their tents in the borders of the land Bountiful; and Amalickiah did pitch his tents in the borders on the beach by the seashore, and after this manner were they driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.33'>And it came to pass that when the night had come, Teancum and his servant stole forth and went out by night, and went into the camp of Amalickiah; and behold, sleep had overpowered them because of their much fatigue, which was caused by the labors and heat of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.34'>And it came to pass that Teancum stole privily into the tent of the king, and put a javelin to his heart; and he did cause the death of the king immediately that he did not awake his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.35'>And he returned again privily to his own camp, and behold, his men were asleep, and he awoke them and told them all the things that he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.51.36'>And he caused that his armies should stand in readiness, lest the Lamanites had awakened and should come upon them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.1'>AND now, it came to pass in the *twenty and sixth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, behold, when the Lamanites awoke on the first morning of the first month, behold, they found Amalickiah was dead in his own tent; and they also saw that Teancum was ready to give them battle on that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.2'>And now, when the Lamanites saw this they were affrighted; and they abandoned their design in marching into the land northward, and retreated with all their army into the city of Mulek, and sought protection in their fortifications.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.3'>And it came to pass that the brother of Amalickiah was appointed king over the people; and his name was Ammoron; thus king Ammoron, the brother of king Amalickiah, was appointed to reign in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.4'>And it came to pass that he did command that his people should maintain those cities, which they had taken by the shedding of blood; for they had not taken any cities save they had lost much blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.5'>And now, Teancum saw that the Lamanites were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken, and those parts of the land which they had obtained possession of; and also seeing the enormity of their number, Teancum thought it was not expedient that he should attempt to attack them in their forts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.6'>But he kept his men round about, as if making preparations for war; yea, and truly he was preparing to defend himself against them, by casting up walls round about and preparing places of resort.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.10'>And Moroni also sent unto him, desiring him that he would be faithful in maintaining that quarter of the land, and that he would seek every opportunity to scourge the Lamanites in that quarter, as much as was in his power, that perhaps he might take again by stratagem or some other way those cities which had been taken out of their hands; and that he also would fortify and strengthen the cities round about, which had not fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.11'>And he also said unto him, I would come unto you, but behold, the Lamanites are upon us in the borders of the land by the west sea; and behold, I go against them, therefore I cannot come unto you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.20'>And it came to pass they sent embassies to the army of the Lamanites, which protected the city of Mulek, to their leader, whose name was Jacob, desiring him that he would come out with his armies to meet them upon the plains between the two cities.

        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.22'>Therefore he caused that Teancum should take a small number of men and march down near the seashore; and Moroni and his army, by night, marched in the wilderness, on the west of the city Mulek; and thus, on the morrow, when the guards of the Lamanites had discovered Teancum, they ran and told it unto Jacob, their leader.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.23'>And it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites did march forth against Teancum, supposing by their numbers to overpower Teancum because of the smallness of his numbers.

        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.29'>Now the Lamanites did not know that Moroni had been in their rear with his army; and all they feared was Lehi and his men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.32'>And Moroni commanded his men that they should fall upon them until they had given up their weapons of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.33'>And it came to pass that Jacob, being their leader, being also a Zoramite, and having an unconquerable spirit, he led the Lamanites forth to battle with exceeding fury against Moroni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.34'>Moroni being in their course of march, therefore Jacob was determined to slay them and cut his way through to the city of Mulek. But behold, Moroni and his men were more powerful; therefore they did not give way before the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.35'>And it came to pass that they fought on both hands with exceeding fury; and there were many slain on both sides; yea, and Moroni was wounded and Jacob was killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.36'>And Lehi pressed upon their rear with such fury with his strong men, that the Lamanites in the rear delivered up their weapons of war; and the remainder of them, being much confused, knew not whither to go or to strike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.37'>Now Moroni seeing their confusion, he said unto them: If ye will bring forth your weapons of war and deliver them up, behold we will forbear shedding your blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.38'>And it came to pass that when the Lamanites had heard these words, their chief captains, all those who were not slain, came forth and threw down their weapons of war at the feet of Moroni, and also commanded their men that they should do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.39'>But behold, there were many that would not; and those who would not deliver up their swords were taken and bound, and their weapons of war were taken from them, and they were compelled to march with their brethren forth into the land Bountiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.52.40'>And now the number of prisoners who were taken exceeded more than the number of those who had been slain, yea, more than those who had been slain on both sides.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.53'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.1'>AND it came to pass that they did set guards over the prisoners of the Lamanites, and did compel them to go forth and bury their dead, yea, and also the dead of the Nephites who were slain; and Moroni placed men over them to guard them while they should perform their labors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.2'>And Moroni went to the city of Mulek with Lehi, and took command of the city and gave it unto Lehi. Now behold, this Lehi was a man who had been with Moroni in the more part of all his battles; and he was a man like unto Moroni, and they rejoiced in each other's safety; yea, they were beloved by each other, and also beloved by all the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.3'>And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had finished burying their dead and also the dead of the Nephites, they were marched back into the land Bountiful; and Teancum, by the orders of Moroni, caused that they should commence laboring in digging a ditch round about the land, or the city, Bountiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.4'>And he caused that they should build a breastwork of timbers upon the inner bank of the ditch; and they cast up dirt out of the ditch against the breastwork of timbers; and thus they did cause the Lamanites to labor until they had encircled the city of Bountiful round about with a strong wall of timbers and earth, to an exceeding height.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.5'>And this city became an exceeding stronghold ever after; and in this city they did guard the prisoners of the Lamanites; yea, even within a wall which they had caused them to build with their own hands. Now Moroni was compelled to cause the Lamanites to labor, because it was easy to guard them while at their labor; and he desired all his forces when he should make an attack upon the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.6'>And it came to pass that Moroni had thus gained a victory over one of the greatest of the armies of the Lamanites, and had obtained possession of the city of Mulek, which was one of the strongest holds of the Lamanites in the land of Nephi; and thus he had also built a stronghold to retain his prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.7'>And it came to pass that he did no more attempt a battle with the Lamanites in that year, but he did employ his men in preparing for war, yea, and in making fortifications to guard against the Lamanites, yea, and also delivering their women and their children from famine and affliction, and providing food for their armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.8'>And now it came to pass that the armies of the Lamanites, on the west sea, south, while in the absence of Moroni on account of some intrigue amongst the Nephites, which caused dissensions amongst them, had gained some ground over the Nephites, yea, insomuch that they had obtained possession of a number of their cities in that part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.9'>And thus because of iniquity amongst themselves, yea, because of dissensions and intrigue among themselves they were placed in the most dangerous circumstances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.10'>And now behold, I have somewhat to say concerning the people of Ammon, who, in the beginning, were Lamanites; but by Ammon and his brethren, or rather by the power and word of God, they had been converted unto the Lord; and they had been brought down into the land of Zarahemla, and had ever since been protected by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.11'>And because of their oath they had been kept from taking up arms against their brethren; for they had taken an oath that they never would shed blood more; and according to their oath they would have perished; yea, they would have suffered themselves to have fallen into the hands of their brethren, had it not been for the pity and the exceeding love which Ammon and his brethren had had for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.12'>And for this cause they were brought down into the land of Zarahemla; and they ever had been protected by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.13'>But it came to pass that when they saw the danger, and the many afflictions and tribulations which the Nephites bore for them, they were moved with compassion and were desirous to take up arms in the defence of their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.14'>But behold, as they were about to take their weapons of war, they were overpowered by the persuasions of Helaman and his brethren, for they were about to break the oath which they had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.15'>And Helaman feared lest by so doing they should lose their souls; therefore all those who had entered into this covenant were compelled to behold their brethren wade through their afflictions, in their dangerous circumstances at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.16'>But behold, it came to pass they had many sons, who had not entered into a covenant that they would not take their weapons of war to defend themselves against their enemies; therefore they did assemble themselves together at this time, as many as were able to take up arms, and they called themselves Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.17'>And they entered into a covenant to fight for the liberty of the Nephites, yea, to protect the land unto the laying down of their lives; yea, even they covenanted that they never would give up their liberty, but they would fight in all cases to protect the Nephites and themselves from bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.18'>Now behold, there were two thousand of those young men, who entered into this covenant and took their weapons of war to defend their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.19'>And now behold, as they never had hitherto been a disadvantage to the Nephites, they became now at this period of time also a great support; for they took their weapons of war, and they would that Helaman should be their leader.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.20'>And they were all young men, and they were exceedingly valiant for courage, and also for strength and activity; but behold, this was not all-they were men who were true at all times in whatsoever thing they were entrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.21'>Yea, they were men of truth and soberness, for they had been taught to keep the commandments of God and to walk uprightly before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.22'>And now it came to pass that Helaman did march at the head of his two thousand stripling soldiers, to the support of the people in the borders of the land on the south by the west sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.53.23'>And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.54'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.1'>AND now it came to pass in the *commencement of the twenty and ninth year of the judges, that Ammoron sent unto Moroni desiring that he would exchange prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.2'>And it came to pass that Moroni felt to rejoice exceedingly at this request, for he desired the provisions which were imparted for the support of the Lamanite prisoners for the support of his own people; and he also desired his own people for the strengthening of his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.3'>Now the Lamanites had taken many women and children, and there was not a woman nor a child among all the prisoners of Moroni, or the prisoners whom Moroni had taken; therefore Moroni resolved upon a stratagem to obtain as many prisoners of the Nephites from the Lamanites as it were possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.4'>Therefore he wrote an epistle, and sent it by the servant of Ammoron, the same who had brought an epistle to Moroni. Now these are the words which he wrote unto Ammoron, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.5'>Behold, Ammoron, I have written unto you somewhat concerning this war which ye have waged against my people, or rather which thy brother hath waged against them, and which ye are still determined to carry on after his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.6'>Behold, I would tell you somewhat concerning the justice of God, and the sword of his almighty wrath, which doth hang over you except ye repent and withdraw your armies into your own lands, or the land of your possessions, which is the land of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.7'>Yea, I would tell you these things if ye were capable of hearkening unto them; yea, I would tell you concerning that awful hell that awaits to receive such murderers as thou and thy brother have been, except ye repent and withdraw your murderous purposes, and return with your armies to your own lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.8'>But as ye have once rejected these things, and have fought against the people of the Lord, even so I may expect you will do it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.9'>And now behold, we are prepared to receive you; yea, and except you withdraw your purposes, behold, ye will pull down the wrath of that God whom you have rejected upon you, even to your utter destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.10'>But, as the Lord liveth, our armies shall come upon you except ye withdraw, and ye shall soon be visited with death, for we will retain our cities and our lands; yea, and we will maintain our religion and the cause of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.11'>But behold, it supposeth me that I talk to you concerning these things in vain; or it supposeth me that thou art a child of hell; therefore I will close my epistle by telling you that I will not exchange prisoners, save it be on conditions that ye will deliver up a man and his wife and his children, for one prisoner; if this be the case that ye will do it, I will exchange.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.12'>And behold, if ye do not this, I will come against you with my armies; yea, even I will arm my women and my children, and I will come against you, and I will follow you even into your own land, which is the land of our first inheritance; yea, and it shall be blood for blood, yea, life for life; and I will give you battle even until you are destroyed from off the face of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.13'>Behold, I am in my anger, and also my people; ye have sought to murder us, and we have only sought to defend ourselves. But behold, if ye seek to destroy us more we will seek to destroy you; yea, and we will seek our land, the land of our first inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.14'>Now I close my epistle. I am Moroni; I am a leader of the people of the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.15'>Now it came to pass that Ammoron, when he had received this epistle, was angry; and he wrote another epistle unto Moroni, and these are the words which he wrote, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.16'>I am Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites; I am the brother of Amalickiah whom ye have murdered. Behold, I will avenge his blood upon you, yea, and I will come upon you with my armies for I fear not your threatenings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.17'>For behold, your fathers did wrong their brethren, insomuch that they did rob them of their right to the government when it rightly belonged unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.18'>And now behold, if ye will lay down your arms, and subject yourselves to be governed by those to whom the government doth rightly belong, then will I cause that my people shall lay down their weapons and shall be at war no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.19'>Behold, ye have breathed out many threatenings against me and my people; but behold, we fear not your threatenings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.20'>Nevertheless, I will grant to exchange prisoners according to your request, gladly, that I may preserve my food for my men of war; and we will wage a war which shall be eternal, either to the subjecting the Nephites to our authority or to their eternal extinction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.21'>And as concerning that God whom ye say we have rejected, behold, we know not such a being; neither do ye; but if it so be that there is such a being, we know not but that he hath made us as well as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.22'>And if it so be that there is a devil and a hell, behold will he not send you there to dwell with my brother whom ye have murdered, whom ye have hinted that he hath gone to such a place? But behold these things matter not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.23'>I am Ammoron, and a descendant of Zoram, whom your fathers pressed and brought out of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.54.24'>And behold now, I am a bold Lamanite; behold, this war hath been waged to avenge their wrongs, and to maintain and to obtain their rights to the government; and I close my epistle to Moroni.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.55'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.1'>NOW it came to pass that when Moroni had received this epistle he was more angry, because he knew that Ammoron had a perfect knowledge of his fraud; yea, he knew that Ammoron knew that it was not a just cause that had caused him to wage a war against the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.2'>And he said: Behold, I will not exchange prisoners with Ammoron save he will withdraw his purpose, as I have stated in my epistle; for I will not grant unto him that he shall have any more power than what he hath got.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.3'>Behold, I know the place where the Lamanites do guard my people whom they have taken prisoners; and as Ammoron would not grant unto me mine epistle, behold, I will give unto him according to my words; yea, I will seek death among them until they shall sue for peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.4'>And now it came to pass that when Moroni had said these words, he caused that a search should be made among his men, that perhaps he might find a man who was a descendant of Laman among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.5'>And it came to pass that they found one, whose name was Laman; and he was one of the servants of the king who was murdered by Amalickiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.6'>Now Moroni caused that Laman and a small number of his men should go forth unto the guards who were over the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.7'>Now the Nephites were guarded in the city of Gid; therefore Moroni appointed Laman and caused that a small number of men should go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.8'>And when it was evening Laman went to the guards who were over the Nephites, and behold, they saw him coming and they hailed him; but he saith unto them: Fear not; behold, I am a Lamanite. Behold, we have escaped from the Nephites, and they sleep; and behold we have taken of their wine and brought with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.9'>Now when the Lamanites heard these words they received him with joy; and they said unto him: Give us of your wine, that we may drink; we are glad that ye have thus taken wine with you for we are weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.10'>But Laman said unto them: Let us keep of our wine till we go against the Nephites to battle. But this saying only made them more desirous to drink of the wine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.11'>For, said they: We are weary, therefore let us take of the wine, and by and by we shall receive wine for our rations, which will strengthen us to go against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.12'>And Laman said unto them: You may do according to your desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.13'>And it came to pass that they did take of the wine freely; and it was pleasant to their taste, therefore they took of it more freely; and it was strong, having been prepared in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.14'>And it came to pass they did drink and were merry, and by and by they were all drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.15'>And now when Laman and his men saw that they were all drunken, and were in a deep sleep, they returned to Moroni and told him all the things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.16'>And now this was according to the design of Moroni. And Moroni had prepared his men with weapons of war; and he went to the city Gid, while the Lamanites were in a deep sleep and drunken, and cast in weapons of war unto the prisoners, insomuch that they were all armed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.17'>Yea, even to their women, and all those of their children, as many as were able to use a weapon of war, when Moroni had armed all those prisoners; and all those things were done in a profound silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.18'>But had they awakened the Lamanites, behold they were drunken and the Nephites could have slain them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.19'>But behold, this was not the desire of Moroni; he did not delight in murder or bloodshed, but he delighted in the saving of his people from destruction; and for this cause he might not bring upon him injustice, he would not fall upon the Lamanites and destroy them in their drunkenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.20'>But he had obtained his desires; for he had armed those prisoners of the Nephites who were within the wall of the city, and had given them power to gain possession of those parts which were within the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.21'>And then he caused the men who were with him to withdraw a pace from them, and surround the armies of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.22'>Now behold this was done in the night-time, so that when the Lamanites awoke in the morning they beheld that they were surrounded by the Nephites without, and that their prisoners were armed within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.23'>And thus they saw that the Nephites had power over them; and in these circumstances they found that it was not expedient that they should fight with the Nephites; therefore their chief captains demanded their weapons of war, and they brought them forth and cast them at the feet of the Nephites, pleading for mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.24'>Now behold, this was the desire of Moroni. He took them prisoners of war, and took possession of the city, and caused that all the prisoners should be liberated, who were Nephites; and they did join the army of Moroni, and were a great strength to his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.25'>And it came to pass that he did cause the Lamanites, whom he had taken prisoners, that they should commence a labor in strengthening the fortifications round about the city Gid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.26'>And it came to pass that when he had fortified the city Gid, according to his desires, he caused that his prisoners should be taken to the city Bountiful; and he also guarded that city with an exceedingly strong force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.27'>And it came to pass that they did, notwithstanding all the intrigues of the Lamanites, keep and protect all the prisoners whom they had taken, and also maintain all the ground and the advantage which they had retaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.28'>And it came to pass that the Nephites began again to be victorious, and to reclaim their rights and their privileges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.29'>Many times did the Lamanites attempt to encircle them about by night, but in these attempts they did lose many prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.30'>And many times did they attempt to administer of their wine to the Nephites, that they might destroy them with poison or with drunkenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.31'>But behold, the Nephites were not slow to remember the Lord their God in this their time of affliction. They could not be taken in their snares; yea, they would not partake of their wine, save they had first given to some of the Lamanite prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.32'>And they were thus cautious that no poison should be administered among them; for if their wine would poison a Lamanite it would also poison a Nephite; and thus they did try all their liquors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.33'>And now it came to pass that it was expedient for Moroni to make preparations to attack the city Morianton; for behold, the Lamanites had, by their labors, fortified the city Morianton until it had become an exceeding stronghold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.55.34'>And they were continually bringing new forces into that city, and also new supplies of provisions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.1'>AND now it came to pass in the *commencement of the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges, on the second day in the first month, Moroni received an epistle from Helaman, stating the affairs of the people in that quarter of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.2'>And these are the words which he wrote, saying: My dearly beloved brother, Moroni, as well in the Lord as in the tribulations of our warfare; behold, my beloved brother, I have somewhat to tell you concerning our warfare in this part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.3'>Behold, two thousand of the sons of those men whom Ammon brought down out of the land of Nephi-now ye have known that these were descendants of Laman, who was the eldest son of our father Lehi;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.4'>Now I need not rehearse unto you concerning their traditions or their unbelief, for thou knowest concerning all these things-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.5'>Therefore it sufficeth me that I tell you that two thousand of these young men have taken their weapons of war, and would that I should be their leader; and we have come forth to defend our country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.6'>And now ye also know concerning the covenant which their fathers made, that they would not take up their weapons of war against their brethren to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.7'>But in the twenty and sixth year, when they saw our afflictions and our tribulations for them, they were about to break the covenant which they had made and take up their weapons of war in our defence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.8'>But I would not suffer them that they should break this covenant which they had made, supposing that God would strengthen us, insomuch that we should not suffer more because of the fulfilling the oath which they had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.9'>But behold, here is one thing in which we may have great joy. For behold, in the *twenty and sixth year, I, Helaman, did march at the head of these two thousand young men to the city of Judea, to assist Antipus, whom ye had appointed a leader over the people of that part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.10'>And I did join my two thousand sons, (for they are worthy to be called sons) to the army of Antipus, in which strength Antipus did rejoice exceedingly; for behold, his army had been reduced by the Lamanites because their forces had slain a vast number of our men, for which cause we have to mourn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.11'>Nevertheless, we may console ourselves in this point, that they have died in the cause of their country and of their God, yea, and they are happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.12'>And the Lamanites had also retained many prisoners, all of whom are chief captains, for none other have they spared alive. And we suppose that they are now at this time in the land of Nephi; it is so if they are not slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.13'>And now these are the cities of which the Lamanites have obtained possession by the shedding of the blood of so many of our valiant men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.14'>The land of Manti, or the city of Manti, and the city of Zeezrom, and the city of Cumeni, and the city of Antiparah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.15'>And these are the cities which they possessed when I arrived at the city of Judea; and I found Antipus and his men toiling with their might to fortify the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.16'>Yea, and they were depressed in body as well as in spirit, for they had fought valiantly by day and toiled by night to maintain their cities; and thus they had suffered great afflictions of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.17'>And now they were determined to conquer in this place or die; therefore you may well suppose that this little force which I brought with me, yea, those sons of mine, gave them great hopes and much joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.18'>And now it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Antipus had received a greater strength to his army, they were compelled by the orders of Ammoron to not come against the city of Judea, or against us, to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.19'>And thus were we favored of the Lord; for had they come upon us in this our weakness they might have perhaps destroyed our little army; but thus were we preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.20'>They were commanded by Ammoron to maintain those cities which they had taken. And thus ended the twenty and sixth year. And in the *commencement of the twenty and seventh year we had prepared our city and ourselves for defence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.21'>Now we were desirous that the Lamanites should come upon us; for we were not desirous to make an attack upon them in their strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.22'>And it came to pass that we kept spies out round about, to watch the movements of the Lamanites, that they might not pass us by night nor by day to make an attack upon our other cities which were on the northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.23'>For we knew in those cities they were not sufficiently strong to meet them; therefore we were desirous, if they should pass by us, to fall upon them in their rear, and thus bring them up in the rear at the same time they were met in the front. We supposed that we could overpower them; but behold, we were disappointed in this our desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.24'>They durst not pass by us with their whole army, neither durst they with a part, lest they should not be sufficiently strong and they should fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.25'>Neither durst they march down against the city of Zarahemla; neither durst they cross the head of Sidon, over to the city of Nephihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.26'>And thus, with their forces, they were determined to maintain those cities which they had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.27'>And now it came to pass in the second month of this year, there was brought unto us many provisions from the fathers of those my two thousand sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.28'>And also there were sent two thousand men unto us from the land of Zarahemla. And thus we were prepared with ten thousand men, and provisions for them, and also for their wives and their children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.29'>And the Lamanites, thus seeing our forces increase daily, and provisions arrive for our support, they began to be fearful, and began to sally forth, if it were possible to put an end to our receiving provisions and strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.30'>Now when we saw that the Lamanites began to grow uneasy on this wise, we were desirous to bring a stratagem into effect upon them; therefore Antipus ordered that I should march forth with my little sons to a neighboring city, as if we were carrying provisions to a neighboring city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.31'>And we were to march near the city of Antiparah, as if we were going to the city beyond, in the borders by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.32'>And it came to pass that we did march forth, as if with our provisions, to go to that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.33'>And it came to pass that Antipus did march forth with a part of his army, leaving the remainder to maintain the city. But he did not march forth until I had gone forth with my little army, and came near the city Antiparah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.34'>And now, in the city Antiparah were stationed the strongest army of the Lamanites; yea, the most numerous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.35'>And it came to pass that when they had been informed by their spies, they came forth with their army and marched against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.36'>And it came to pass that we did flee before them, northward. And thus we did lead away the most powerful army of the Lamanites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.37'>Yea, even to a considerable distance, insomuch that when they saw the army of Antipus pursuing them, with their might, they did not turn to the right nor to the left, but pursued their march in a straight course after us; and, as we suppose, it was their intent to slay us before Antipus should overtake them, and this that they might not be surrounded by our people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.38'>And now Antipus, beholding our danger, did speed the march of his army. But behold, it was night; therefore they did not overtake us, neither did Antipus overtake them; therefore we did camp for the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.39'>And it came to pass that before the dawn of the morning, behold, the Lamanites were pursuing us. Now we were not sufficiently strong to contend with them; yea, I would not suffer that my little sons should fall into their hands; therefore we did continue our march, and we took our march into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.40'>Now they durst not turn to the right nor to the left lest they should be surrounded; neither would I turn to the right nor to the left lest they should overtake me, and we could not stand against them, but be slain, and they would make their escape; and thus we did flee all that day into the wilderness, even until it was dark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.41'>And it came to pass that again, when the light of the morning came we saw the Lamanites upon us, and we did flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.42'>But it came to pass that they did not pursue us far before they halted; and it was in the morning of the third day of the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.43'>And now, whether they were overtaken by Antipus we knew not, but I said unto my men: Behold, we know not but they have halted for the purpose that we should come against them, that they might catch us in their snare;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.44'>Therefore what say ye, my sons, will ye go against them to battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.45'>And now I say unto you, my beloved brother Moroni, that never had I seen so great courage, nay, not amongst all the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.46'>For as I had ever called them my sons (for they were all of them very young) even so they said unto me: Father, behold our God is with us, and he will not suffer that we should fall; then let us go forth; we would not slay our brethren if they would let us alone; therefore let us go, lest they should overpower the army of Antipus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.47'>Now they never had fought, yet they did not fear death; and they did think more upon the liberty of their fathers than they did upon their lives; yea, they had been taught by their mothers, that if they did not doubt, God would deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.48'>And they rehearsed unto me the words of their mothers, saying: We do not doubt our mothers knew it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.49'>And it came to pass that I did return with my two thousand against these Lamanites who had pursued us. And now behold, the armies of Antipus had overtaken them, and a terrible battle had commenced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.50'>The army of Antipus being weary, because of their long march in so short a space of time, were about to fall into the hands of the Lamanites; and had I not returned with my two thousand they would have obtained their purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.51'>For Antipus had fallen by the sword, and many of his leaders, because of their weariness, which was occasioned by the speed of their march-therefore the men of Antipus, being confused because of the fall of their leaders, began to give way before the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.52'>And it came to pass that the Lamanites took courage, and began to pursue them; and thus were the Lamanites pursuing them with great vigor when Helaman came upon their rear with his two thousand, and began to slay them exceedingly, insomuch that the whole army of the Lamanites halted and turned upon Helaman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.53'>Now when the people of Antipus saw that the Lamanites had turned them about, they gathered together their men and came again upon the rear of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.54'>And now it came to pass that we, the people of Nephi, the people of Antipus, and I with my two thousand, did surround the Lamanites, and did slay them; yea, insomuch that they were compelled to deliver up their weapons of war and also themselves as prisoners of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.55'>And now it came to pass that when they had surrendered themselves up unto us, behold, I numbered those young men who had fought with me, fearing lest there were many of them slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.56'>But behold, to my great joy, there had not one soul of them fallen to the earth; yea, and they had fought as if with the strength of God; yea, never were men known to have fought with such miraculous strength; and with such mighty power did they fall upon the Lamanites, that they did frighten them; and for this cause did the Lamanites deliver themselves up as prisoners of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.56.57'>And as we had no place for our prisoners, that we could guard them to keep them from the armies of the Lamanites, therefore we sent them to the land of Zarahemla, and a part of those men who were not slain of Antipus, with them; and the remainder I took and joined them to my stripling Ammonites, and took our march back to the city of Judea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.57'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.1'>AND now it came to pass that I received an epistle from Ammoron, the king, stating that if I would deliver up those prisoners of war whom we had taken that he would deliver up the city of Antiparah unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.2'>But I sent an epistle unto the king, that we were sure our forces were sufficient to take the city of Antiparah by our force; and by delivering up the prisoners for that city we should suppose ourselves unwise, and that we would only deliver up our prisoners on exchange.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.3'>And Ammoron refused mine epistle, for he would not exchange prisoners; therefore we began to make preparations to go against the city of Antiparah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.4'>But the people of Antiparah did leave the city, and fled to their other cities, which they had possession of, to fortify them; and thus the city of Antiparah fell into our hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.5'>And thus ended the twenty and eighth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.6'>And it came to pass that in the *commencement of the twenty and ninth year, we received a supply of provisions, and also an addition to our army, from the land of Zarahemla, and from the land round about, to the number of six thousand men, besides sixty of the sons of the Ammonites who had come to join their brethren, my little band of two thousand. And now behold, we were strong, yea, and we had also plenty of provisions brought unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.7'>And it came to pass that it was our desire to wage a battle with the army which was placed to protect the city Cumeni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.8'>And now behold, I will show unto you that we soon accomplished our desire; yea, with our strong force, or with a part of our strong force, we did surround, by night, the city Cumeni, a little before they were to receive a supply of provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.9'>And it came to pass that we did camp round about the city for many nights; but we did sleep upon our swords, and keep guards, that the Lamanites could not come upon us by night and slay us, which they attempted many times; but as many times as they attempted this their blood was spilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.10'>At length their provisions did arrive, and they were about to enter the city by night. And we, instead of being Lamanites, were Nephites; therefore, we did take them and their provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.11'>And notwithstanding the Lamanites being cut off from their support after this manner, they were still determined to maintain the city; therefore it became expedient that we should take those provisions and send them to Judea, and our prisoners to the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.12'>And it came to pass that not many days had passed away before the Lamanites began to lose all hopes of succor; therefore they yielded up the city unto our hands; and thus we had accomplished our designs in obtaining the city Cumeni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.13'>But it came to pass that our prisoners were so numerous that, notwithstanding the enormity of our numbers, we were obliged to employ all our force to keep them, or to put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.14'>For behold, they would break out in great numbers, and would fight with stones, and with clubs, or whatsoever thing they could get into their hands, insomuch that we did slay upwards of two thousand of them after they had surrendered themselves prisoners of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.15'>Therefore it became expedient for us, that we should put an end to their lives, or guard them, sword in hand, down to the land of Zarahemla; and also our provisions were not any more than sufficient for our own people, notwithstanding that which we had taken from the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.16'>And now, in those critical circumstances, it became a very serious matter to determine concerning these prisoners of war; nevertheless, we did resolve to send them down to the land of Zarahemla; therefore we selected a part of our men, and gave them charge over our prisoners to go down to the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.17'>But it came to pass that on the morrow they did return. And now behold, we did not inquire of them concerning the prisoners; for behold, the Lamanites were upon us, and they returned in season to save us from falling into their hands. For behold, Ammoron had sent to their support a new supply of provisions and also a numerous army of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.18'>And it came to pass that those men whom we sent with the prisoners did arrive in season to check them, as they were about to overpower us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.19'>But behold, my little band of two thousand and sixty fought most desperately; yea, they were firm before the Lamanites, and did administer death unto all those who opposed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.20'>And as the remainder of our army were about to give way before the Lamanites, behold, those two thousand and sixty were firm and undaunted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.21'>Yea, and they did obey and observe to perform every word of command with exactness; yea, and even according to their faith it was done unto them; and I did remember the words which they said unto me that their mothers had taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.22'>And now behold, it was these my sons, and those men who had been selected to convey the prisoners, to whom we owe this great victory; for it was they who did beat the Lamanites; therefore they were driven back to the city of Manti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.23'>And we retained our city Cumeni, and were not all destroyed by the sword; nevertheless, we had suffered great loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.24'>And it came to pass that after the Lamanites had fled, I immediately gave orders that my men who had been wounded should be taken from among the dead, and caused that their wounds should be dressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.25'>And it came to pass that there were two hundred, out of my two thousand and sixty, who had fainted because of the loss of blood; nevertheless, according to the goodness of God, and to our great astonishment, and also the joy of our whole army, there was not one soul of them who did perish; yea, and neither was there one soul among them who had not received many wounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.26'>And now, their preservation was astonishing to our whole army, yea, that they should be spared while there was a thousand of our brethren who were slain. And we do justly ascribe it to the miraculous power of God, because of their exceeding faith in that which they had been taught to believe-that there was a just God, and whosoever did not doubt, that they should be preserved by his marvelous power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.27'>Now this was the faith of these of whom I have spoken; they are young, and their minds are firm, and they do put their trust in God continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.28'>And now it came to pass that after we had thus taken care of our wounded men, and had buried our dead and also the dead of the Lamanites, who were many, behold, we did inquire of Gid concerning the prisoners whom they had started to go down to the land of Zarahemla with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.29'>Now Gid was the chief captain over the band who was appointed to guard them down to the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.30'>And now, these are the words which Gid said unto me: Behold, we did start to go down to the land of Zarahemla with our prisoners. And it came to pass that we did meet the spies of our armies, who had been sent out to watch the camp of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.31'>And they cried unto us, saying-Behold, the armies of the Lamanites are marching towards the city of Cumeni; and behold, they will fall upon them, yea, and will destroy our people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.32'>And it came to pass that our prisoners did hear their cries, which caused them to take courage; and they did rise up in rebellion against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.33'>And it came to pass because of their rebellion we did cause that our swords should come upon them. And it came to pass that they did in a body run upon our swords, in the which, the greater number of them were slain; and the remainder of them broke through and fled from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.34'>And behold, when they had fled and we could not overtake them, we took our march with speed towards the city Cumeni; and behold, we did arrive in time that we might assist our brethren in preserving the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.35'>And behold, we are again delivered out of the hands of our enemies. And blessed is the name of our God; for behold, it is he that has delivered us; yea, that has done this great thing for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.57.36'>Now it came to pass that when I, Helaman, had heard these words of Gid, I was filled with exceeding joy because of the goodness of God in preserving us, that we might not all perish; yea, and I trust that the souls of them who have been slain have entered into the rest of their God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.58'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.1'>AND behold, now it came to pass that our next object was to obtain the city of Manti; but behold, there was no way that we could lead them out of the city by our small bands. For behold, they remembered that which we had hitherto done; therefore we could not decoy them away from their strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.2'>And they were so much more numerous than was our army that we durst not go forth and attack them in their strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.3'>Yea, and it became expedient that we should employ our men to the maintaining those parts of the land which we had regained of our possessions; therefore it became expedient that we should wait, that we might receive more strength from the land of Zarahemla and also a new supply of provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.4'>And it came to pass that I thus did send an embassy to the governor of our land, to acquaint him concerning the affairs of our people. And it came to pass that we did wait to receive provisions and strength from the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.5'>But behold, this did profit us but little; for the Lamanites were also receiving great strength from day to day, and also many provisions; and thus were our circumstances at this period of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.6'>And the Lamanites were sallying forth against us from time to time, resolving by stratagem to destroy us; nevertheless we could not come to battle with them, because of their retreats and their strongholds.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.8'>But it came to pass that we did receive food, which was guarded to us by an army of two thousand men to our assistance; and this is all the assistance which we did receive, to defend ourselves and our country from falling into the hands of our enemies, yea, to contend with an enemy which was innumerable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.9'>And now the cause of these our embarrassments, or the cause why they did not send more strength unto us, we knew not; therefore we were grieved and also filled with fear, lest by any means the judgments of God should come upon our land, to our overthrow and utter destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.10'>Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.11'>Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.36'>And if it is not so, behold, we fear that there is some faction in the government, that they do not send more men to our assistance; for we know that they are more numerous than that which they have sent.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.38'>Behold, this is the twenty and ninth year, in the latter end, and we are in the possession of our lands; and the Lamanites have fled to the land of Nephi.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.58.41'>And now, my beloved brother, Moroni, may the Lord our God, who has redeemed us and made us free, keep you continually in his presence; yea, and may he favor this people, even that ye may have success in obtaining the possession of all that which the Lamanites have taken from us, which was for our support.

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.59'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.1'>NOW it came to pass in the *thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, after Moroni had received and had read Helaman's epistle, he was exceedingly rejoiced because of the welfare, yea, the exceeding success which Helaman had had, in obtaining those lands which were lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.2'>Yea, and he did make it known unto all his people, in all the land round about in that part where he was, that they might rejoice also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.3'>And it came to pass that he immediately sent an epistle to Pahoran, desiring that he should cause men to be gathered together to strengthen Helaman, or the armies of Helaman, insomuch that he might with ease maintain that part of the land which he had been so miraculously prospered in regaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.4'>And it came to pass when Moroni had sent this epistle to the land of Zarahemla, he began again to lay a plan that he might obtain the remainder of those possessions and cities which the Lamanites had taken from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.5'>And it came to pass that while Moroni was thus making preparations to go against the Lamanites to battle, behold, the people of Nephihah, who were gathered together from the city of Moroni and the city of Lehi and the city of Morianton, were attacked by the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.6'>Yea, even those who had been compelled to flee from the land of Manti, and from the land round about, had come over and joined the Lamanites in this part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.7'>And thus being exceedingly numerous, yea, and receiving strength from day to day, by the command of Ammoron they came forth against the people of Nephihah, and they did begin to slay them with an exceedingly great slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.8'>And their armies were so numerous that the remainder of the people of Nephihah were obliged to flee before them; and they came even and joined the army of Moroni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.9'>And now as Moroni had supposed that there should be men sent to the city of Nephihah, to the assistance of the people to maintain that city, and knowing that it was easier to keep the city from falling into the hands of the Lamanites than to retake it from them, he supposed that they would easily maintain that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.10'>Therefore he retained all his force to maintain those places which he had recovered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.11'>And now, when Moroni saw that the city of Nephihah was lost he was exceedingly sorrowful, and began to doubt, because of the wickedness of the people, whether they should not fall into the hands of their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.12'>Now this was the case with all his chief captains. They doubted and marveled also because of the wickedness of the people, and this because of the success of the Lamanites over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.59.13'>And it came to pass that Moroni was angry with the government, because of their indifference concerning the freedom of their country.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.60'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.1'>AND it came to pass that he wrote again to the governor of the land, who was Pahoran, and these are the words which he wrote, saying: Behold, I direct mine epistle to Pahoran, in the city of Zarahemla, who is the chief judge and the governor over the land, and also to all those who have been chosen by this people to govern and manage the affairs of this war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.2'>For behold, I have somewhat to say unto them by the way of condemnation; for behold, ye yourselves know that ye have been appointed to gather together men, and arm them with swords, and with cimeters, and all manner of weapons of war of every kind, and send forth against the Lamanites, in whatsoever parts they should come into our land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.3'>And now behold, I say unto you that myself, and also my men, and also Helaman and his men, have suffered exceedingly great sufferings; yea, even hunger, thirst, and fatigue, and all manner of afflictions of every kind.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.9'>But behold, this is not all-ye have withheld your provisions from them, insomuch that many have fought and bled out their lives because of their great desires which they had for the welfare of this people; yea, and this they have done when they were about to perish with hunger, because of your exceedingly great neglect towards them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.10'>And now, my beloved brethren-for ye ought to be beloved; yea, and ye ought to have stirred yourselves more diligently for the welfare and the freedom of this people; but behold, ye have neglected them insomuch that the blood of thousands shall come upon your heads for vengeance; yea, for known unto God were all their cries, and all their sufferings-</verse>

I say unto you, if ye have supposed this ye have supposed in vain; for I say unto you, there are many who have fallen by the sword; and behold it is to your condemnation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.13'>For the Lord suffereth the righteous to be slain that his justice and judgment may come upon the wicked; therefore ye need not suppose that the righteous are lost because they are slain; but behold, they do enter into the rest of the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.14'>And now behold, I say unto you, I fear exceedingly that the judgments of God will come upon this people, because of their exceeding slothfulness, yea, even the slothfulness of our government, and their exceedingly great neglect towards their brethren, yea, towards those who have been slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.15'>For were it not for the wickedness which first commenced at our head, we could have withstood our enemies that they could have gained no power over us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.60.17'>But behold, now the Lamanites are coming upon us, taking possession of our lands, and they are murdering our people with the sword, yea, our women and our children, and also carrying them away captive, causing them that they should suffer all manner of afflictions, and this because of the great wickedness of those who are seeking for power and authority, yea, even those king-men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.1'>BEHOLD, now it came to pass that soon after Moroni had sent his epistle unto the chief governor, he received an epistle from Pahoran, the chief governor. And these are the words which he received:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.2'>I, Pahoran, who am the chief governor of this land, do send these words unto Moroni, the chief captain over the army. Behold, I say unto you, Moroni, that I do not joy in your great afflictions, yea, it grieves my soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.3'>But behold, there are those who do joy in your afflictions, yea, insomuch that they have risen up in rebellion against me, and also those of my people who are freemen, yea, and those who have risen up are exceedingly numerous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.4'>And it is those who have sought to take away the judgment-seat from me that have been the cause of this great iniquity; for they have used great flattery, and they have led away the hearts of many people, which will be the cause of sore affliction among us; they have withheld our provisions, and have daunted our freemen that they have not come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.5'>And behold, they have driven me out before them, and I have fled to the land of Gideon, with as many men as it were possible that I could get.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.6'>And behold, I have sent a proclamation throughout this part of the land; and behold, they are flocking to us daily, to their arms, in the defence of their country and their freedom, and to avenge our wrongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.7'>And they have come unto us, insomuch that those who have risen up in rebellion against us are set at defiance, yea, insomuch that they do fear us and durst not come out against us to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.8'>They have got possession of the land, or the city, of Zarahemla; they have appointed a king over them, and he hath written unto the king of the Lamanites, in the which he hath joined an alliance with him; in the which alliance he hath agreed to maintain the city of Zarahemla, which maintenance he supposeth will enable the Lamanites to conquer the remainder of the land, and he shall be placed king over this people when they shall be conquered under the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.9'>And now, in your epistle you have censured me, but it mattereth not; I am not angry, but do rejoice in the greatness of your heart. I, Pahoran, do not seek for power, save only to retain my judgment-seat that I may preserve the rights and the liberty of my people. My soul standeth fast in that liberty in the which God hath made us free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.61.10'>And now, behold, we will resist wickedness even unto bloodshed. We would not shed the blood of the Lamanites if they would stay in their own land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.2'>But he did also mourn exceedingly because of the iniquity of those who had driven Pahoran from the judgment-seat, yea, in fine because of those who had rebelled against their country and also their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.3'>And it came to pass that Moroni took a small number of men, according to the desire of Pahoran, and gave Lehi and Teancum command over the remainder of his army, and took his march towards the land of Gideon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.4'>And he did raise the standard of liberty in whatsoever place he did enter, and gained whatsoever force he could in all his march towards the land of Gideon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.6'>And thus, when Moroni had gathered together whatsoever men he could in all his march, he came to the land of Gideon; and uniting his forces with those of Pahoran they became exceedingly strong, even stronger than the men of Pachus, who was the king of those dissenters who had driven the freemen out of the land of Zarahemla and had taken possession of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.7'>And it came to pass that Moroni and Pahoran went down with their armies into the land of Zarahemla, and went forth against the city, and did meet the men of Pachus, insomuch that they did come to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.8'>And behold, Pachus was slain and his men were taken prisoners, and Pahoran was restored to his judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.9'>And the men of Pachus received their trial, according to the law, and also those king-men who had been taken and cast into prison; and they were executed according to the law; yea, those men of Pachus and those king-men, whosoever would not take up arms in the defence of their country, but would fight against it, were put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.10'>And thus it became expedient that this law should be strictly observed for the safety of their country; yea, and whosoever was found denying their freedom was speedily executed according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.11'>And thus ended the thirtieth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi; Moroni and Pahoran having restored peace to the land of Zarahemla, among their own people, having inflicted death upon all those who were not true to the cause of freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.12'>And it came to pass in the *commencement of the thirty and first year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi, Moroni immediately caused that provisions should be sent, and also an army of six thousand men should be sent unto Helaman, to assist him in preserving that part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.13'>And he also caused that an army of six thousand men, with a sufficient quantity of food, should be sent to the armies of Lehi and Teancum. And it came to pass that this was done to fortify the land against the Lamanites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.15'>And it came to pass that as they were marching towards the land, they took a large body of men of the Lamanites, and slew many of them, and took their provisions and their weapons of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.16'>And it came to pass after they had taken them, they caused them to enter into a covenant that they would no more take up their weapons of war against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.17'>And when they had entered into this covenant they sent them to dwell with the people of Ammon, and they were in number about four thousand who had not been slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.18'>And it came to pass that when they had sent them away they pursued their march towards the land of Nephihah. And it came to pass that when they had come to the city of Nephihah, they did pitch their tents in the plains of Nephihah, which is near the city of Nephihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.19'>Now Moroni was desirous that the Lamanites should come out to battle against them, upon the plains; but the Lamanites, knowing of their exceedingly great courage, and beholding the greatness of their numbers, therefore they durst not come out against them; therefore they did not come to battle in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.20'>And when the night came, Moroni went forth in the darkness of the night, and came upon the top of the wall to spy out in what part of the city the Lamanites did camp with their army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.21'>And it came to pass that they were on the east, by the entrance; and they were all asleep.

        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.22'>And it came to pass that Moroni caused that his men should march forth and come upon the top of the wall, and let themselves down into that part of the city, yea, even on the west, where the Lamanites did not camp with their armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.23'>And it came to pass that they were all let down into the city by night, by the means of their strong cords and their ladders; thus when the morning came they were all within the walls of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.24'>And now, when the Lamanites awoke and saw that the armies of Moroni were within the walls, they were affrighted exceedingly, insomuch that they did flee out by the pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.25'>And now when Moroni saw that they were fleeing before him, he did cause that his men should march forth against them, and slew many, and surrounded many others, and took them prisoners; and the remainder of them fled into the land of Moroni, which was in the borders by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.26'>Thus had Moroni and Pahoran obtained the possession of the city of Nephihah without the loss of one soul; and there were many of the Lamanites who were slain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.30'>Now it came to pass that Moroni, after he had obtained possession of the city of Nephihah, having taken many prisoners, which did reduce the armies of the Lamanites exceedingly, and having regained many of the Nephites who had been taken prisoners, which did strengthen the army of Moroni exceedingly; therefore Moroni went forth from the land of Nephihah to the land of Lehi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.31'>And it came to pass that when the Lamanites saw that Moroni was coming against them, they were again frightened and fled before the army of Moroni.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.33'>And the armies of the Lamanites were all gathered together, insomuch that they were all in one body in the land of Moroni. Now Ammoron, the king of the Lamanites, was also with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.34'>And it came to pass that Moroni and Lehi and Teancum did encamp with their armies round about in the borders of the land of Moroni, insomuch that the Lamanites were encircled about in the borders by the wilderness on the south, and in the borders by the wilderness on the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.35'>And thus they did encamp for the night. For behold, the Nephites and the Lamanites also were weary because of the greatness of the march; therefore they did not resolve upon any stratagem in the night-time, save it were Teancum; for he was exceedingly angry with Ammoron, insomuch that he considered that Ammoron, and Amalickiah his brother, had been the cause of this great and lasting war between them and the Lamanites, which had been the cause of so much war and bloodshed, yea, and so much famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.36'>And it came to pass that Teancum in his anger did go forth into the camp of the Lamanites, and did let himself down over the walls of the city. And he went forth with a cord, from place to place, insomuch that he did find the king; and he did cast a javelin at him, which did pierce him near the heart. But behold, the king did awaken his servants before he died, insomuch that they did pursue Teancum, and slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.37'>Now it came to pass that when Lehi and Moroni knew that Teancum was dead they were exceedingly sorrowful; for behold, he had been a man who had fought valiantly for his country, yea, a true friend to liberty; and he had suffered very many exceedingly sore afflictions. But behold, he was dead, and had gone the way of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.38'>Now it came to pass that Moroni marched forth on the morrow, and came upon the Lamanites, insomuch that they did slay them with a great slaughter; and they did drive them out of the land; and they did flee, even that they did not return at that time against the Nephites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.42'>And it came to pass that after Moroni had fortified those parts of the land which were most exposed to the Lamanites, until they were sufficiently strong, he returned to the city of Zarahemla; and also Helaman returned to the place of his inheritance; and there was once more peace established among the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.62.43'>And Moroni yielded up the command of his armies into the hands of his son, whose name was Moronihah; and he retired to his own house that he might spend the remainder of his days in peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>For behold, Pahoran had died, and gone the way of all the earth; therefore there began to be a serious contention concerning who should have the judgment-seat among the brethren, who were the sons of Pahoran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>Now these are their names who did contend for the judgment-seat, who did also cause the people to contend: Pahoran, Paanchi, and Pacumeni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>Now these are not all the sons of Pahoran (for he had many), but these are they who did contend for the judgment-seat; therefore, they did cause three divisions among the people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And it came to pass as he was about to do this, behold, he was taken, and was tried according to the voice of the people, and condemned unto death; for he had raised up in rebellion and sought to destroy the liberty of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>Now when those people who were desirous that he should be their governor saw that he was condemned unto death, therefore they were angry, and behold, they sent forth one Kishkumen, even to the judgment-seat of Pahoran, and murdered Pahoran as he sat upon the judgment-seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>And he was pursued by the servants of Pahoran; but behold, so speedy was the flight of Kishkumen that no man could overtake him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>And they came down again that they might pitch battle against the Nephites. And they were led by a man whose name was Coriantumr; and he was a descendant of Zarahemla; and he was a dissenter from among the Nephites; and he was a large and a mighty man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>Therefore, the king of the Lamanites, whose name was Tubaloth, who was the son of Ammoron, supposing that Coriantumr, being a mighty man, could stand against the Nephites, with his strength and also with his great wisdom, insomuch that by sending him forth he should gain power over the Nephites-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>Therefore he did stir them up to anger, and he did gather together his armies, and he did appoint Coriantumr to be their leader, and did cause that they should march down to the land of Zarahemla to battle against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>And it came to pass that because of so much contention and so much difficulty in the government, that they had not kept sufficient guards in the land of Zarahemla; for they had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the heart of their lands to attack that great city Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>But it came to pass that Coriantumr did march forth at the head of his numerous host, and came upon the inhabitants of the city, and their march was with such exceedingly great speed that there was no time for the Nephites to gather together their armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Therefore Coriantumr did cut down the watch by the entrance of the city, and did march forth with his whole army into the city, and they did slay every one who did oppose them, insomuch that they did take possession of the whole city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>And now when Coriantumr saw that he was in possession of the city of Zarahemla, and saw that the Nephites had fled before them, and were slain, and were taken, and were cast into prison, and that he had obtained the possession of the strongest hold in all the land, his heart took courage insomuch that he was about to go forth against all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>And now he did not tarry in the land of Zarahemla, but he did march forth with a large army, even towards the city of Bountiful; for it was his determination to go forth and cut his way through with the sword, that he might obtain the north parts of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>And, supposing that their greatest strength was in the center of the land, therefore he did march forth, giving them no time to assemble themselves together save it were in small bodies; and in this manner they did fall upon them and cut them down to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>But behold, this march of Coriantumr through the center of the land gave Moronihah great advantage over them, notwithstanding the greatness of the number of the Nephites who were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>For behold, Moronihah had supposed that the Lamanites durst not come into the center of the land, but that they would attack the cities round about in the borders as they had hitherto done; therefore Moronihah had caused that their strong armies should maintain those parts round about by the borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>But behold, the Lamanites were not frightened according to his desire, but they had come into the center of the land, and had taken the capital city which was the city of Zarahemla, and were marching through the most capital parts of the land, slaying the people with a great slaughter, both men, women, and children, taking possession of many cities and of many strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.28'>But when Moronihah had discovered this, he immediately sent forth Lehi with an army round about to head them before they should come to the land Bountiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.29'>And thus he did; and he did head them before they came to the land Bountiful, and gave unto them battle, insomuch that they began to retreat back towards the land of Zarahemla.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.30'>And it came to pass that Moronihah did head them in their retreat, and did give unto them battle, insomuch that it became an exceedingly bloody battle; yea, many were slain, and among the number who were slain Coriantumr was also found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.31'>And now, behold, the Lamanites could not retreat either way, neither on the north, nor on the south, nor on the east, nor on the west, for they were surrounded on every hand by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.32'>And thus had Coriantumr plunged the Lamanites into the midst of the Nephites, insomuch that they were in the power of the Nephites, and he himself was slain, and the Lamanites did yield themselves into the hands of the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.33'>And it came to pass that Moronihah took possession of the city of Zarahemla again, and caused that the Lamanites who had been taken prisoners should depart out of the land in peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>Now this did please Kishkumen exceedingly, for he did suppose that he should accomplish his design; but behold, the servant of Helaman, as they were going forth unto the judgment-seat, did stab Kishkumen even to the heart, that he fell dead without a groan. And he ran and told Helaman all the things which he had seen, and heard, and done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>But behold, there are many books and many records of every kind, and they have been kept chiefly by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>And they have been handed down from one generation to another by the Nephites, even until they have fallen into transgression and have been murdered, plundered, and hunted, and driven forth, and slain, and scattered upon the face of the earth, and mixed with the Lamanites until they are no more called the Nephites, becoming wicked, and wild, and ferocious, yea, even becoming Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And now I return again to mine account; therefore, what I have spoken had passed after there had been great contentions, and disturbances, and wars, and dissensions, among the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>The forty and sixth year of the reign of the judges ended;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>And it came to pass that there was still great contention in the land, yea, even in the *forty and seventh year, and also in the forty and eighth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>Nevertheless Helaman did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did observe to keep the statutes, and the judgments, and the commandments of God; and he did do that which was right in the sight of God continually; and he did walk after the ways of his father, insomuch that he did prosper in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And it came to pass that he had two sons. He gave unto the eldest the name of Nephi, and unto the youngest, the name of Lehi. And they began to grow up unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>And it came to pass that the wars and contentions began to cease, in a small degree, among the people of the Nephites, in the latter end of the forty and eighth year of the reign of the judges over the people of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>And it came to pass in the *forty and ninth year of the reign of the judges, there was continual peace established in the land, all save it were the secret combinations which Gadianton the robber had established in the more settled parts of the land, which at that time were not known unto those who were at the head of government; therefore they were not destroyed out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>And it came to pass that in this same year there was exceedingly great prosperity in the church, insomuch that there were thousands who did join themselves unto the church and were baptized unto repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>And so great was the prosperity of the church, and so many the blessings which were poured out upon the people, that even the high priests and the teachers were themselves astonished beyond measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>And it came to pass that the work of the Lord did prosper unto the baptizing and uniting to the church of God, many souls, yea, even tens of thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>Thus we may see that the Lord is merciful unto all who will, in the sincerity of their hearts, call upon his holy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>Yea, thus we see that the gate of heaven is open unto all, even to those who will believe on the name of Jesus Christ, who is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>Yea, we see that whosoever will may lay hold upon the word of God, which is quick and powerful, which shall divide asunder all the cunning and the snares and the wiles of the devil, and lead the man of Christ in a strait and narrow course across that everlasting gulf of misery which is prepared to engulf the wicked-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>And land their souls, yea, their immortal souls, at the right hand of God in the kingdom of heaven, to sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and with Jacob, and with all our holy fathers, to go no more out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>And in this year there was continual rejoicing in the land of Zarahemla, and in all the regions round about, even in all the land which was possessed by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>And it came to pass that there was peace and exceedingly great joy in the remainder of the forty and ninth year; yea, and also there was continual peace and great joy in the fiftieth year of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And in the *fifty and first year of the reign of the judges there was peace also, save it were the pride which began to enter into the church-not into the church of God, but into the hearts of the people who professed to belong to the church of God-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>And they were lifted up in pride, even to the persecution of many of their brethren. Now this was a great evil, which did cause the more humble part of the people to suffer great persecutions, and to wade through much affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>Nevertheless they did fast and pray oft, and did wax stronger and stronger in their humility, and firmer and firmer in the faith of Christ, unto the filling their souls with joy and consolation, yea, even to the purifying and the sanctification of their hearts, which sanctification cometh because of their yielding their hearts unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And it came to pass that the fifty and second year ended in peace also, save it were the exceedingly great pride which had gotten into the hearts of the people; and it was because of their exceedingly great riches and their prosperity in the land; and it did grow upon them from day to day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>And it came to pass in the *fifty and third year of the reign of the judges, Helaman died, and his eldest son Nephi began to reign in his stead. And it came to pass that he did fill the judgment-seat with justice and equity; yea, he did keep the commandments of God, and did walk in the ways of his father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>AND it came to pass in the *fifty and fourth year there were many dissensions in the church, and there was also a contention among the people, insomuch that there was much bloodshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>And the rebellious part were slain and driven out of the land, and they did go unto the king of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>And it came to pass that they did endeavor to stir up the Lamanites to war against the Nephites; but behold, the Lamanites were exceedingly afraid, insomuch that they would not hearken to the words of those dissenters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>But it came to pass in the fifty and sixth year of the reign of the judges, there were dissenters who went up from the Nephites unto the Lamanites; and they succeeded with those others in stirring them up to anger against the Nephites; and they were all that year preparing for war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>And in the *fifty and seventh year they did come down against the Nephites to battle, and they did commence the work of death; yea, insomuch that in the fifty and eighth year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in obtaining possession of the land of Zarahemla; yea, and also all the lands, even unto the land which was near the land Bountiful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And the Nephites and the armies of Moronihah were driven even into the land of Bountiful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>And there they did fortify against the Lamanites, from the west sea, even unto the east; it being a day's journey for a Nephite, on the line which they had fortified and stationed their armies to defend their north country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>And thus those dissenters of the Nephites, with the help of a numerous army of the Lamanites, had obtained all the possession of the Nephites which was in the land southward. And all this was done in the fifty and eighth and ninth years of the reign of the judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>And it came to pass in the sixtieth year of the reign of the judges, Moronihah did succeed with his armies in obtaining many parts of the land; yea, they regained many cities which had fallen into the hands of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>And it came to pass in the *sixty and first year of the reign of the judges they succeeded in regaining even the half of all their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>Now this great loss of the Nephites, and the great slaughter which was among them, would not have happened had it not been for their wickedness and their abomination which was among them; yea, and it was among those also who professed to belong to the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And it was because of the pride of their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, yea, it was because of their oppression to the poor, withholding their food from the hungry, withholding their clothing from the naked, and smiting their humble brethren upon the cheek, making a mock of that which was sacred, denying the spirit of prophecy and of revelation, murdering, plundering, lying, stealing, committing adultery, rising up in great contentions, and deserting away into the land of Nephi, among the Lamanites-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.13'>And because of this their great wickedness, and their boastings in their own strength, they were left in their own strength; therefore they did not prosper, but were afflicted and smitten, and driven before the Lamanites, until they had lost possession of almost all their lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.14'>But behold, Moronihah did preach many things unto the people because of their iniquity, and also Nephi and Lehi, who were the sons of Helaman, did preach many things unto the people, yea, and did prophesy many things unto them concerning their iniquities, and what should come unto them if they did not repent of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.15'>And it came to pass that they did repent, and inasmuch as they did repent they did begin to prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.16'>For when Moronihah saw that they did repent he did venture to lead them forth from place to place, and from city to city, even until they had regained the one-half of their property and the one-half of all their lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.17'>And thus ended the sixty and first year of the reign of the judges.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.19'>Therefore they did abandon their design to obtain the remainder of their lands, for so numerous were the Lamanites that it became impossible for the Nephites to obtain more power over them; therefore Moronihah did employ all his armies in maintaining those parts which he had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.20'>And it came to pass, because of the greatness of the number of the Lamanites the Nephites were in great fear, lest they should be overpowered, and trodden down, and slain, and destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.21'>Yea, they began to remember the prophecies of Alma, and also the words of Mosiah; and they saw that they had been a stiffnecked people, and that they had set at naught the commandments of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.22'>And that they had altered and trampled under their feet the laws of Mosiah, or that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people; and they saw that their laws had become corrupted, and that they had become a wicked people, insomuch that they were wicked even like unto the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.23'>And because of their iniquity the church had begun to dwindle; and they began to disbelieve in the spirit of prophecy and in the spirit of revelation; and the judgments of God did stare them in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.24'>And they saw that they had become weak, like unto their brethren, the Lamanites, and that the Spirit of the Lord did no more preserve them; yea, it had withdrawn from them because the Spirit of the Lord doth not dwell in unholy temples-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.25'>Therefore the Lord did cease to preserve them by his miraculous and matchless power, for they had fallen into a state of unbelief and awful wickedness; and they saw that the Lamanites were exceedingly more numerous than they, and except they should cleave unto the Lord their God they must unavoidably perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.26'>For behold, they saw that the strength of the Lamanites was as great as their strength, even man for man. And thus had they fallen into this great transgression; yea, thus had they become weak, because of their transgression, in the space of not many years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>AND it came to pass that in this *same year, behold, Nephi delivered up the judgment-seat to a man whose name was Cezoram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.2'>For as their laws and their governments were established by the voice of the people, and they who chose evil were more numerous than they who chose good, therefore they were ripening for destruction, for the laws had become corrupted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.3'>Yea, and this was not all; they were a stiffnecked people, insomuch that they could not be governed by the law nor justice, save it were to their destruction.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.5'>For they remembered the words which their father Helaman spake unto them. And these are the words which he spake:</verse>

Behold, I have given unto you the names of our first parents who came out of the land of Jerusalem; and this I have done that when you remember your names ye may remember them; and when ye remember them ye may remember their works; and when ye remember their works ye may know how that it is said, and also written, that they were good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.7'>Therefore, my sons, I would that ye should do that which is good, that it may be said of you, and also written, even as it has been said and written of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.8'>And now my sons, behold I have somewhat more to desire of you, which desire is, that ye may not do these things that ye may boast, but that ye may do these things to lay up for yourselves a treasure in heaven, yea, which is eternal, and which fadeth not away; yea, that ye may have that precious gift of eternal life, which we have reason to suppose hath been given to our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.9'>O remember, remember, my sons, the words which king Benjamin spake unto his people; yea, remember that there is no other way nor means whereby man can be saved, only through the atoning blood of Jesus Christ, who shall come; yea, remember that he cometh to redeem the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.10'>And remember also the words which Amulek spake unto Zeezrom, in the city of Ammonihah; for he said unto him that the Lord surely should come to redeem his people, but that he should not come to redeem them in their sins, but to redeem them from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.11'>And he hath power given unto him from the Father to redeem them from their sins because of repentance; therefore he hath sent his angels to declare the tidings of the conditions of repentance, which bringeth unto the power of the Redeemer, unto the salvation of their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.12'>And now, my sons, remember, remember that it is upon the rock of our Redeemer, who is Christ, the Son of God, that ye must build your foundation; that when the devil shall send forth his mighty winds, yea, his shafts in the whirlwind, yea, when all his hail and his mighty storm shall beat upon you, it shall have no power over you to drag you down to the gulf of misery and endless wo, because of the rock upon which ye are built, which is a sure foundation, a foundation whereon if men build they cannot fall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.13'>And it came to pass that these were the words which Helaman taught to his sons; yea, he did teach them many things which are not written, and also many things which are written.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.17'>And it came to pass that they did preach with great power, insomuch that they did confound many of those dissenters who had gone over from the Nephites, insomuch that they came forth and did confess their sins and were baptized unto repentance, and immediately returned to the Nephites to endeavor to repair unto them the wrongs which they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.18'>And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did preach unto the Lamanites with such great power and authority, for they had power and authority given unto them that they might speak, and they also had what they should speak given unto them-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.19'>Therefore they did speak unto the great astonishment of the Lamanites, to the convincing them, insomuch that there were eight thousand of the Lamanites who were in the land of Zarahemla and round about baptized unto repentance, and were convinced of the wickedness of the traditions of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.20'>And it came to pass that Nephi and Lehi did proceed from thence to go to the land of Nephi.</verse>

Nevertheless, Nephi and Lehi were not burned; and they were as standing in the midst of fire and were not burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.24'>And when they saw that they were encircled about with a pillar of fire, and that it burned them not, their hearts did take courage.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.6'>Now this great iniquity had come upon the Nephites, in the space of not many years; and when Nephi saw it, his heart was swollen with sorrow within his breast; and he did exclaim in the agony of his soul:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.7.7'>Oh, that I could have had my days in the days when my father Nephi first came out of the land of Jerusalem, that I could have joyed with him in the promised land; then were his people easy to be entreated, firm to keep the commandments of God, and slow to be led to do iniquity; and they were quick to hearken unto the words of the Lord-</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.2'>Why seest thou this man, and hearest him revile against this people and against our law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.3'>For behold, Nephi had spoken unto them concerning the corruptness of their law; yea, many things did Nephi speak which cannot be written; and nothing did he speak which was contrary to the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.4'>And those judges were angry with him because he spake plainly unto them concerning their secret works of darkness; nevertheless, they durst not lay their own hands upon him, for they feared the people lest they should cry out against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.5'>Therefore they did cry unto the people, saying: Why do you suffer this man to revile against us? For behold he doth condemn all this people, even unto destruction; yea, and also that these our great cities shall be taken from us, that we shall have no place in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.6'>And now we know that this is impossible, for behold, we are powerful, and our cities great, therefore our enemies can have no power over us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.8'>Yea, behold, all the judgments will come upon us which he has testified unto us; for we know that he has testified aright unto us concerning our iniquities.

        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.10'>And it came to pass that those people who sought to destroy Nephi were compelled because of their fear, that they did not lay their hands on him; therefore he began again to speak unto them, seeing that he had gained favor in the eyes of some, insomuch that the remainder of them did fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.11'>Therefore he was constrained to speak more unto them saying: Behold, my brethren, have ye not read that God gave power unto one man, even Moses, to smite upon the waters of the Red Sea, and they parted hither and thither, insomuch that the Israelites, who were our fathers, came through upon dry ground, and the waters closed upon the armies of the Egyptians and swallowed them up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.12'>And now behold, if God gave unto this man such power, then why should ye dispute among yourselves, and say that he hath given unto me no power whereby I may know concerning the judgments that shall come upon you except ye repent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.8.13'>But, behold, ye not only deny my words, but ye also deny all the words which have been spoken by our fathers, and also the words which were spoken by this man, Moses, who had such great power given unto him, yea, the words which he hath spoken concerning the coming of the Messiah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>But behold, we know that this is a wicked tradition, which has been handed down unto us by our fathers, to cause us that we should believe in some great and marvelous thing which should come to pass, but not among us, but in a land which is far distant, a land which we know not; therefore they can keep us in ignorance, for we cannot witness with our own eyes that they are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>And they will, by the cunning and the mysterious arts of the evil one, work some great mystery which we cannot understand, which will keep us down to be servants to their words, and also servants unto them, for we depend upon them to teach us the word; and thus will they keep us in ignorance if we will yield ourselves unto them, all the days of our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>And many more things did the people imagine up in their hearts, which were foolish and vain; and they were much disturbed, for Satan did stir them up to do iniquity continually; yea, he did go about spreading rumors and contentions upon all the face of the land, that he might harden the hearts of the people against that which was good and against that which should come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>And notwithstanding the signs and the wonders which were wrought among the people of the Lord, and the many miracles which they did, Satan did get great hold upon the hearts of the people upon all the face of the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>NOW it came to pass that the *ninety and first year had passed away and it was six hundred years from the time that Lehi left Jerusalem; and it was in the year that Lachoneus was the chief judge and the governor over the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>And Nephi, the son of Helaman, had departed out of the land of Zarahemla, giving charge unto his son Nephi, who was his eldest son, concerning the plates of brass, and all the records which had been kept, and all those things which had been kept sacred from the departure of Lehi out of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>Then he departed out of the land, and whither he went, no man knoweth; and his son Nephi did keep the records in his stead, yea, the record of this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And it came to pass that in the commencement of the ninety and second year, behold, the prophecies of the prophets began to be fulfilled more fully; for there began to be greater signs and greater miracles wrought among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>But there were some who began to say that the time was past for the words to be fulfilled, which were spoken by Samuel, the Lamanite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And they began to rejoice over their brethren, saying: Behold the time is past, and the words of Samuel are not fulfilled; therefore, your joy and your faith concerning this thing hath been vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And it came to pass that they did make a great uproar throughout the land; and the people who believed began to be very sorrowful, lest by any means those things which had been spoken might not come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But behold, they did watch steadfastly for that day and that night and that day which should be as one day as if there were no night, that they might know that their faith had not been vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>Now it came to pass that there was a day set apart by the unbelievers, that all those who believed in those traditions should be put to death except the sign should come to pass, which had been given by Samuel the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>Now it came to pass that when Nephi, the son of Nephi, saw this wickedness of his people, his heart was exceedingly sorrowful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>And it came to pass that he went out and bowed himself down upon the earth, and cried mightily to his God in behalf of his people, yea, those who were about to be destroyed because of their faith in the tradition of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>And it came to pass that he cried mightily unto the Lord all that day; and behold, the voice of the Lord came unto him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Lift up your head and be of good cheer; for behold, the time is at hand, and on this night shall the sign be given, and on the morrow come I into the world, to show unto the world that I will fulfil all that which I have caused to be spoken by the mouth of my holy prophets.</verse>

And behold, the time is at hand, and this night shall the sign be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And it came to pass that the words which came unto Nephi were fulfilled, according as they had been spoken; for behold, at the going down of the sun there was no darkness; and the people began to be astonished because there was no darkness when the night came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And there were many, who had not believed the words of the prophets, who fell to the earth and became as if they were dead, for they knew that the great plan of destruction which they had laid for those who believed in the words of the prophets had been frustrated; for the sign which had been given was already at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And they began to know that the Son of God must shortly appear; yea, in fine, all the people upon the face of the whole earth from the west to the east, both in the land north and in the land south, were so exceedingly astonished that they fell to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>For they knew that the prophets had testified of these things for many years, and that the sign which had been given was already at hand; and they began to fear because of their iniquity and their unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And it came to pass that there was no darkness in all that night, but it was as light as though it was mid-day. And it came to pass that the sun did rise in the morning again, according to its proper order; and they knew that it was the day that the Lord should be born, because of the sign which had been given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And it had come to pass, yea, all things, every whit, according to the words of the prophets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And it came to pass that from this time forth there began to be lyings sent forth among the people, by Satan, to harden their hearts, to the intent that they might not believe in those signs and wonders which they had seen; but notwithstanding these lyings and deceivings the more part of the people did believe, and were converted unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And it came to pass that Nephi went forth among the people, and also many others, baptizing unto repentance, in the which there was a great remission of sins. And thus the people began again to have peace in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And there were no contentions, save it were a few that began to preach, endeavoring to prove by the scriptures that it was no more expedient to observe the law of Moses. Now in this thing they did err, having not understood the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>But it came to pass that they soon became converted, and were convinced of the error which they were in, for it was made known unto them that the law was not yet fulfilled, and that it must be fulfilled in every whit; yea, the word came unto them that it must be fulfilled; yea, that one jot or tittle should not pass away till it should all be fulfilled; therefore in this same year were they brought to a knowledge of their error and did confess their faults.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>And thus the ninety and second year did pass away, bringing glad tidings unto the people because of the signs which did come to pass, according to the words of the prophecy of all the holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>And it came to pass that the ninety and third year did also pass away in peace, save it were for the Gadianton robbers, who dwelt upon the mountains, who did infest the land; for so strong were their holds and their secret places that the people could not overpower them; therefore they did commit many murders, and did do much slaughter among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>And it came to pass that in the ninety and fourth year they began to increase in a great degree, because there were many dissenters of the Nephites who did flee unto them, which did cause much sorrow unto those Nephites who did remain in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And there was also a cause of much sorrow among the Lamanites; for behold, they had many children who did grow up and began to wax strong in years, that they became for themselves, and were led away by some who were Zoramites, by their lyings and their flattering words, to join those Gadianton robbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>And thus were the Lamanites afflicted also, and began to decrease as to their faith and righteousness, because of the wickedness of the rising generation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>AND it came to pass that thus passed away the *ninety and fifth year also, and the people began to forget those signs and wonders which they had heard, and began to be less and less astonished at a sign or a wonder from heaven, insomuch that they began to be hard in their hearts, and blind in their minds, and began to disbelieve all which they had heard and seen-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>Imagining up some vain thing in their hearts, that it was wrought by men and by the power of the devil, to lead away and deceive the hearts of the people; and thus did Satan get possession of the hearts of the people again, insomuch that he did blind their eyes and lead them away to believe that the doctrine of Christ was a foolish and a vain thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>And it came to pass that the people began to wax strong in wickedness and abominations; and they did not believe that there should be any more signs or wonders given; and Satan did go about, leading away the hearts of the people, tempting them and causing them that they should do great wickedness in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>And thus did pass away the ninety and sixth year; and also the ninety and seventh year; and also the ninety and eighth year; and also the ninety and ninth year;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>And also an hundred years had passed away since the days of Mosiah, who was king over the people of the Nephites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>Now the Nephites began to reckon their time from this period when the sign was given, or from the coming of Christ; therefore, nine years had passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>And Nephi, who was the father of Nephi, who had the charge of the records, did not return to the land of Zarahemla, and could nowhere be found in all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>And it came to pass that the people did still remain in wickedness, notwithstanding the much preaching and prophesying which was sent among them; and thus passed away the tenth year also; and the eleventh year also passed away in iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass in the *thirteenth year there began to be wars and contentions throughout all the land; for the Gadianton robbers had become so numerous, and did slay so many of the people, and did lay waste so many cities, and did spread so much death and carnage throughout the land, that it became expedient that all the people, both the Nephites and the Lamanites, should take up arms against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>Therefore, all the Lamanites who had become converted unto the Lord did unite with their brethren, the Nephites, and were compelled, for the safety of their lives and their women and their children, to take up arms against those Gadianton robbers, yea, and also to maintain their rights, and the privileges of their church and of their worship, and their freedom and their liberty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>And it came to pass that before this thirteenth year had passed away the Nephites were threatened with utter destruction because of this war, which had become exceedingly sore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>And it came to pass that those Lamanites who had united with the Nephites were numbered among the Nephites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And their curse was taken from them, and their skin became white like unto the Nephites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And their young men and their daughters became exceedingly fair, and they were numbered among the Nephites, and were called Nephites. And thus ended the thirteenth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And it came to pass in the commencement of the fourteenth year, the war between the robbers and the people of Nephi did continue and did become exceedingly sore; nevertheless, the people of Nephi did gain some advantage of the robbers, insomuch that they did drive them back out of their lands into the mountains and into their secret places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And thus ended the fourteenth year. And in the *fifteenth year they did come forth against the people of Nephi; and because of the wickedness of the people of Nephi, and their many contentions and dissensions, the Gadianton robbers did gain many advantages over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>And thus ended the fifteenth year, and thus were the people in a state of many afflictions; and the sword of destruction did hang over them, insomuch that they were about to be smitten down by it, and this because of their iniquity.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>AND now it came to pass that in the *sixteenth year from the coming of Christ, Lachoneus, the governor of the land, received an epistle from the leader and the governor of this band of robbers; and these were the words which were written, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Lachoneus, most noble and chief governor of the land, behold, I write this epistle unto you, and do give unto you exceedingly great praise because of your firmness, and also the firmness of your people, in maintaining that which ye suppose to be your right and liberty; yea, ye do stand well, as if ye were supported by the hand of a god, in the defence of your liberty, and your property, and your country, or that which ye do call so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And it seemeth a pity unto me, most noble Lachoneus, that ye should be so foolish and vain as to suppose that ye can stand against so many brave men who are at my command, who do now at this time stand in their arms, and do await with great anxiety for the word-Go down upon the Nephites and destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And I, knowing of their unconquerable spirit, having proved them in the field of battle, and knowing of their everlasting hatred towards you because of the many wrongs which ye have done unto them, therefore if they should come down against you they would visit you with utter destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>Therefore I have written this epistle, sealing it with mine own hand, feeling for your welfare, because of your firmness in that which ye believe to be right, and your noble spirit in the field of battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>Therefore I write unto you, desiring that ye would yield up unto this my people, your cities, your lands, and your possessions, rather than that they should visit you with the sword and that destruction should come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>Or in other words, yield yourselves up unto us, and unite with us and become acquainted with our secret works, and become our brethren that ye may be like unto us-not our slaves, but our brethren and partners of all our substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>And behold, I swear unto you, if ye will do this, with an oath, ye shall not be destroyed; but if ye will not do this, I swear unto you with an oath, that on the morrow month I will command that my armies shall come down against you, and they shall not stay their hand and shall spare not, but shall slay you, and shall let fall the sword upon you even until ye shall become extinct.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.9'>And behold, I am Giddianhi; and I am the governor of this the secret society of Gadianton; which society and the works thereof I know to be good; and they are of ancient date and they have been handed down unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>And I write this epistle unto you, Lachoneus, and I hope that ye will deliver up your lands and your possessions, without the shedding of blood, that this my people may recover their rights and government, who have dissented away from you because of your wickedness in retaining from them their rights of government, and except ye do this, I will avenge their wrongs. I am Giddianhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>And now it came to pass when Lachoneus received this epistle he was exceedingly astonished, because of the boldness of Giddianhi demanding the possession of the land of the Nephites, and also of threatening the people and avenging the wrongs of those that had received no wrong, save it were they had wronged themselves by dissenting away unto those wicked and abominable robbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.12'>Now behold, this Lachoneus, the governor, was a just man, and could not be frightened by the demands and the threatenings of a robber; therefore he did not hearken to the epistle of Giddianhi, the governor of the robbers, but he did cause that his people should cry unto the Lord for strength against the time that the robbers should come down against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.13'>Yea, he sent a proclamation among all the people, that they should gather together their women, and their children, their flocks and their herds, and all their substance, save it were their land, unto one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.14'>And he caused that fortifications should be built round about them, and the strength thereof should be exceedingly great. And he caused that armies, both of the Nephites and of the Lamanites, or of all them who were numbered among the Nephites, should be placed as guards round about to watch them, and to guard them from the robbers day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.15'>Yea, he said unto them: As the Lord liveth, except ye repent of all your iniquities, and cry unto the Lord, ye will in nowise be delivered out of the hands of those Gadianton robbers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.16'>And so great and marvelous were the words and prophecies of Lachoneus that they did cause fear to come upon all the people; and they did exert themselves in their might to do according to the words of Lachoneus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.17'>And it came to pass that Lachoneus did appoint chief captains over all the armies of the Nephites, to command them at the time that the robbers should come down out of the wilderness against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.18'>Now the chiefest among all the chief captains and the great commander of all the armies of the Nephites was appointed, and his name was Gidgiddoni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.19'>Now it was the custom among all the Nephites to appoint for their chief captains, (save it were in their times of wickedness) some one that had the spirit of revelation and also prophecy; therefore, this Gidgiddoni was a great prophet among them, as also was the chief judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.20'>Now the people said unto Gidgiddoni: Pray unto the Lord, and let us go up upon the mountains and into the wilderness, that we may fall upon the robbers and destroy them in their own lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.21'>But Gidgiddoni saith unto them: The Lord forbid; for if we should go up against them the Lord would deliver us into their hands; therefore we will prepare ourselves in the center of our lands, and we will gather all our armies together, and we will not go against them, but we will wait till they shall come against us; therefore as the Lord liveth, if we do this he will deliver them into our hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.22'>And it came to pass in the *seventeenth year, in the latter end of the year, the proclamation of Lachoneus had gone forth throughout all the face of the land, and they had taken their horses, and their chariots, and their cattle, and all their flocks, and their herds, and their grain, and all their substance, and did march forth by thousands and by tens of thousands, until they had all gone forth to the place which had been appointed that they should gather themselves together, to defend themselves against their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.23'>And the land which was appointed was the land of Zarahemla, and the land which was between the land Zarahemla and the land Bountiful, yea, to the line which was between the land Bountiful and the land Desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.24'>And there were a great many thousand people who were called Nephites, who did gather themselves together in this land. Now Lachoneus did cause that they should gather themselves together in the land southward, because of the great curse which was upon the land northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.25'>And they did fortify themselves against their enemies; and they did dwell in one land, and in one body, and they did fear the words which had been spoken by Lachoneus, insomuch that they did repent of all their sins; and they did put up their prayers unto the Lord their God, that he would deliver them in the time that their enemies should come down against them to battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.26'>And they were exceedingly sorrowful because of their enemies. And Gidgiddoni did cause that they should make weapons of war of every kind, and they should be strong with armor, and with shields, and with bucklers, after the manner of his instruction.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.1'>AND it came to pass that in the latter *end of the eighteenth year those armies of robbers had prepared for battle, and began to come down and to sally forth from the hills, and out of the mountains, and the wilderness, and their strongholds, and their secret places, and began to take possession of the lands, both which were in the land south and which were in the land north, and began to take possession of all the lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and the cities which had been left desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.2'>But behold, there were no wild beasts nor game in those lands which had been deserted by the Nephites, and there was no game for the robbers save it were in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.3'>And the robbers could not exist save it were in the wilderness, for the want of food; for the Nephites had left their lands desolate, and had gathered their flocks and their herds and all their substance, and they were in one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.4'>Therefore, there was no chance for the robbers to plunder and to obtain food, save it were to come up in open battle against the Nephites; and the Nephites being in one body, and having so great a number, and having reserved for themselves provisions, and horses and cattle, and flocks of every kind, that they might subsist for the space of seven years, in the which time they did hope to destroy the robbers from off the face of the land; and thus the eighteenth year did pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.5'>And it came to pass that in the *nineteenth year Giddianhi found that it was expedient that he should go up to battle against the Nephites, for there was no way that they could subsist save it were to plunder and rob and murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.6'>And they durst not spread themselves upon the face of the land insomuch that they could raise grain, lest the Nephites should come upon them and slay them; therefore Giddianhi gave commandment unto his armies that in this year they should go up to battle against the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.7'>And it came to pass that they did come up to battle; and it was in the sixth month; and behold, great and terrible was the day that they did come up to battle; and they were girded about after the manner of robbers; and they had a lamb-skin about their loins, and they were dyed in blood, and their heads were shorn, and they had head-plates upon them; and great and terrible was the appearance of the armies of Giddianhi, because of their armor, and because of their being dyed in blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.8'>And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites, when they saw the appearance of the army of Giddianhi, had all fallen to the earth, and did lift their cries to the Lord their God, that he would spare them and deliver them out of the hands of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.9'>And it came to pass that when the armies of Giddianhi saw this they began to shout with a loud voice, because of their joy, for they had supposed that the Nephites had fallen with fear because of the terror of their armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.10'>But in this thing they were disappointed, for the Nephites did not fear them; but they did fear their God and did supplicate him for protection; therefore, when the armies of Giddianhi did rush upon them they were prepared to meet them; yea, in the strength of the Lord they did receive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.11'>And the battle commenced in this the sixth month; and great and terrible was the battle thereof, yea, great and terrible was the slaughter thereof, insomuch that there never was known so great a slaughter among all the people of Lehi since he left Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.12'>And notwithstanding the threatenings and the oaths which Giddianhi had made, behold, the Nephites did beat them, insomuch that they did fall back from before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.13'>And it came to pass that Gidgiddoni commanded that his armies should pursue them as far as the borders of the wilderness, and that they should not spare any that should fall into their hands by the way; and thus they did pursue them and did slay them, to the borders of the wilderness, even until they had fulfilled the commandment of Gidgiddoni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.14'>And it came to pass that Giddianhi, who had stood and fought with boldness, was pursued as he fled; and being weary because of his much fighting he was overtaken and slain. And thus was the end of Giddianhi the robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.15'>And it came to pass that the armies of the Nephites did return again to their place of security. And it came to pass that this nineteenth year did pass away, and the robbers did not come again to battle; neither did they come again in the twentieth year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.16'>And in the *twenty and first year they did not come up to battle, but they came up on all sides to lay siege round about the people of Nephi; for they did suppose that if they should cut off the people of Nephi from their lands, and should hem them in on every side, and if they should cut them off from all their outward privileges, that they could cause them to yield themselves up according to their wishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.17'>Now they had appointed unto themselves another leader, whose name was Zemnarihah; therefore it was Zemnarihah that did cause that this siege should take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.18'>But behold, this was an advantage to the Nephites; for it was impossible for the robbers to lay siege sufficiently long to have any effect upon the Nephites, because of their much provision which they had laid up in store,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.25'>And this did they do in the night-time, and got on their march beyond the robbers, so that on the morrow, when the robbers began their march, they were met by the armies of the Nephites both in their front and in their rear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.26'>And the robbers who were on the south were also cut off in their places of retreat. And all these things were done by command of Gidgiddoni.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.27'>And there were many thousands who did yield themselves up prisoners unto the Nephites, and the remainder of them were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.28'>And their leader, Zemnarihah, was taken and hanged upon a tree, yea, even upon the top thereof until he was dead. And when they had hanged him until he was dead they did fell the tree to the earth, and did cry with a loud voice, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.29'>May the Lord preserve his people in righteousness and in holiness of heart, that they may cause to be felled to the earth all who shall seek to slay them because of power and secret combinations, even as this man hath been felled to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.30'>And they did rejoice and cry again with one voice, saying: May the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, protect this people in righteousness, so long as they shall call on the name of their God for protection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.31'>And it came to pass that they did break forth, all as one, in singing, and praising their God for the great thing which he had done for them, in preserving them from falling into the hands of their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.32'>Yea, they did cry: Hosanna to the Most High God. And they did cry: Blessed be the name of the Lord God Almighty, the Most High God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.4.33'>And their hearts were swollen with joy, unto the gushing out of many tears, because of the great goodness of God in delivering them out of the hands of their enemies; and they knew it was because of their repentance and their humility that they had been delivered from an everlasting destruction.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.3'>And they granted unto those robbers who had entered into a covenant to keep the peace of the land, who were desirous to remain Lamanites, lands, according to their numbers, that they might have, with their labors, wherewith to subsist upon; and thus they did establish peace in all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.4'>And they began again to prosper and to wax great; and the twenty and sixth and seventh years passed away, and there was great order in the land; and they had formed their laws according to equity and justice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.8'>And there were many highways cast up, and many roads made, which led from city to city, and from land to land, and from place to place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.28'>And they did enter into a covenant one with another, yea, even into that covenant which was given by them of old, which covenant was given and administered by the devil, to combine against all righteousness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.9'>Now this secret combination, which had brought so great iniquity upon the people, did gather themselves together, and did place at their head a man whom they did call Jacob;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.12'>Therefore, Jacob seeing that their enemies were more numerous than they, he being the king of the band, therefore he commanded his people that they should take their flight into the northernmost part of the land, and there build up unto themselves a kingdom, until they were joined by dissenters, (for he flattered them that there would be many dissenters) and they become sufficiently strong to contend with the tribes of the people; and they did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.13'>And so speedy was their march that it could not be impeded until they had gone forth out of the reach of the people. And thus ended the thirtieth year; and thus were the affairs of the people of Nephi.</verse>

But they did establish very strict laws that one tribe should not trespass against another, insomuch that in some degree they had peace in the land; nevertheless, their hearts were turned from the Lord their God, and they did stone the prophets and did cast them out from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.15'>And it came to pass that Nephi-having been visited by angels and also the voice of the Lord, therefore having seen angels, and being eye-witness, and having had power given unto him that he might know concerning the ministry of Christ, and also being eye-witness to their quick return from righteousness unto their wickedness and abominations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.16'>Therefore, being grieved for the hardness of their hearts and the blindness of their minds-went forth among them in that same year, and began to testify, boldly, repentance and remission of sins through faith on the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.17'>And he did minister many things unto them; and all of them cannot be written, and a part of them would not suffice, therefore they are not written in this book. And Nephi did minister with power and with great authority.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.22'>And as many as had devils cast out from them, and were healed of their sicknesses and their infirmities, did truly manifest unto the people that they had been wrought upon by the Spirit of God, and had been healed; and they did show forth signs also and did do some miracles among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.23'>Thus passed away the *thirty and second year also. And Nephi did cry unto the people in the commencement of the thirty and third year; and he did preach unto them repentance and remission of sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.24'>And now, in this *two hundred and first year there began to be among them those who were lifted up in pride, such as the wearing of costly apparel, and all manner of fine pearls, and of the fine things of the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.26'>And they began to be divided into classes; and they began to build up churches unto themselves to get gain, and began to deny the true church of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.27'>And it came to pass that when *two hundred and ten years had passed away there were many churches in the land; yea, there were many churches which professed to know the Christ, and yet they did deny the more parts of his gospel, insomuch that they did receive all manner of wickedness, and did administer that which was sacred unto him to whom it had been forbidden because of unworthiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.28'>And this church did multiply exceedingly because of iniquity, and because of the power of Satan who did get hold upon their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.29'>And again, there was another church which denied the Christ; and they did persecute the true church of Christ, because of their humility and their belief in Christ; and they did despise them because of the many miracles which were wrought among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.30'>Therefore they did exercise power and authority over the disciples of Jesus who did tarry with them, and they did cast them into prison; but by the power of the word of God, which was in them, the prisons were rent in twain, and they went forth doing mighty miracles among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.31'>Nevertheless, and notwithstanding all these miracles, the people did harden their hearts, and did seek to kill them, even as the Jews at Jerusalem sought to kill Jesus, according to his word.</verse>

And they did smite upon the people of Jesus; but the people of Jesus did not smite again. And thus they did dwindle in unbelief and wickedness, from year to year, even until two hundred and thirty years had passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.35'>And now it came to pass in this year, yea, in the *two hundred and thirty and first year, there was a great division among the people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.38'>And it came to pass that they who rejected the gospel were called Lamanites, and Lemuelites, and Ishmaelites; and they did not dwindle in unbelief, but they did wilfully rebel against the gospel of Christ; and they did teach their children that they should not believe, even as their fathers, from the beginning, did dwindle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.39'>And it was because of the wickedness and abomination of their fathers, even as it was in the beginning. And they were taught to hate the children of God, even as the Lamanites were taught to hate the children of Nephi from the beginning.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.41'>And they did still continue to build up churches unto themselves, and adorn them with all manner of precious things. And thus did two hundred and fifty years pass away, and also two hundred and sixty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.42'>And it came to pass that the wicked part of the people began again to build up the secret oaths and combinations of Gadianton.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.43'>And also the people who were called the people of Nephi began to be proud in their hearts, because of their exceeding riches, and become vain like unto their brethren, the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.44'>And from this time the disciples began to sorrow for the sins of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.45'>And it came to pass that when three hundred years had passed away, both the people of Nephi and the Lamanites had become exceedingly wicked one like unto another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.46'>And it came to pass that the robbers of Gadianton did spread over all the face of the land; and there were none that were righteous save it were the disciples of Jesus. And gold and silver did they lay up in store in abundance, and did traffic in all manner of traffic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.47'>And it came to pass that after *three hundred and five years had passed away, (and the people did still remain in wickedness) Amos died; and his brother, Ammaron, did keep the record in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.48'>And it came to pass that when *three hundred and twenty years had passed away, Ammaron, being constrained by the Holy Ghost, did hide up the records which were sacred-yea, even all the sacred records which had been handed down from generation to generation, which were sacred-even until the three hundred and twentieth year from the coming of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.49'>And he did hide them up unto the Lord, that they might come again unto the remnant of the house of Jacob, according to the prophecies and the promises of the Lord. And thus is the end of the record of Ammaron.</verse>

And notwithstanding I being young, was large in stature; therefore the people of Nephi appointed me that I should be their leader, or the leader of their armies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.8'>But behold, the land was filled with robbers and with Lamanites; and notwithstanding the great destruction which hung over my people, they did not repent of their evil doings; therefore there was blood and carnage spread throughout all the face of the land, both on the part of the Nephites and also on the part of the Lamanites; and it was one complete revolution throughout all the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.9'>And now, the Lamanites had a king, and his name was Aaron; and he came against us with an army of forty and four thousand.

And behold, all this was done, and *three hundred and thirty years had passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.10'>And it came to pass that the Nephites began to repent of their iniquity, and began to cry even as had been prophesied by Samuel the prophet; for behold no man could keep that which was his own, for the thieves, and the robbers, and the murderers, and the magic art, and the witchcraft which was in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.11'>Thus there began to be a mourning and a lamentation in all the land because of these things, and more especially among the people of Nephi.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.13'>But behold this my joy was vain, for their sorrowing was not unto repentance, because of the goodness of God; but it was rather the sorrowing of the damned, because the Lord would not always suffer them to take happiness in sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.14'>And they did not come unto Jesus with broken hearts and contrite spirits, but they did curse God, and wish to die. Nevertheless they would struggle with the sword for their lives.</verse>

And thus *three hundred and forty and four years had passed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.16'>And it came to pass that in the three hundred and forty and fifth year the Nephites did begin to flee before the Lamanites; and they were pursued until they came even to the land of Jashon, before it was possible to stop them in their retreat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.17'>And now, the city of Jashon was near the land where Ammaron had deposited the records unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed. And behold I had gone according to the word of Ammaron, and taken the plates of Nephi, and did make a record according to the words of Ammaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.18'>And upon the plates of Nephi I did make a full account of all the wickedness and abominations; but upon these plates I did forbear to make a full account of their wickedness and abominations, for behold, a continual scene of wickedness and abominations has been before mine eyes ever since I have been sufficient to behold the ways of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.19'>And wo is me because of their wickedness; for my heart has been filled with sorrow because of their wickedness, all my days; nevertheless, I know that I shall be lifted up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.20'>And it came to pass that in this year the people of Nephi again were hunted and driven. And it came to pass that we were driven forth until we had come northward to the land which was called Shem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.21'>And it came to pass that we did fortify the city of Shem, and we did gather in our people as much as it were possible, that perhaps we might save them from destruction.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.23'>And it came to pass that I did speak unto my people, and did urge them with great energy, that they would stand boldly before the Lamanites and fight for their wives, and their children, and their houses, and their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.24'>And my words did arouse them somewhat to vigor, insomuch that they did not flee from before the Lamanites, but did stand with boldness against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.25'>And it came to pass that we did contend with an army of thirty thousand against an army of fifty thousand. And it came to pass that we did stand before them with such firmness that they did flee from before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.26'>And it came to pass that when they had fled we did pursue them with our armies, and did meet them again, and did beat them; nevertheless the strength of the Lord was not with us; yea, we were left to ourselves, that the Spirit of the Lord did not abide in us; therefore we had become weak like unto our brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.27'>And my heart did sorrow because of this the great calamity of my people, because of their wickedness and their abominations. But behold, we did go forth against the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, until we had again taken possession of the lands of our inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.28'>And the *three hundred and forty and ninth year had passed away. And in the three hundred and fiftieth year we made a treaty with the Lamanites and the robbers of Gadianton, in which we did get the lands of our inheritance divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.2.29'>And the Lamanites did give unto us the land northward, yea, even to the narrow passage which led into the land southward. And we did give unto the Lamanites all the land southward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.8.32'>Yea, it shall come in a day when there shall be churches built up that shall say: Come unto me, and for your money you shall be forgiven of your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.8.33'>O ye wicked and perverse and stiffnecked people, why have ye built up churches unto yourselves to get gain? Why have ye transfigured the holy word of God, that ye might bring damnation upon your souls?

        <verse osisID='1Chr.8.38'>O ye pollutions, ye hypocrites, ye teachers, who sell yourselves for that which will canker, why have ye polluted the holy church of God? Why are ye ashamed to take upon you the name of Christ? Why do ye not think that greater is the value of an endless happiness than that misery which never dies-because of the praise of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.8.39'>Why do ye adorn yourselves with that which hath no life, and yet suffer the hungry, and the needy, and the naked, and the sick and the afflicted to pass by you, and notice them not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.8.40'>Yea, why do ye build up your secret abominations to get gain, and cause that widows should mourn before the Lord, and also orphans to mourn before the Lord, and also the blood of their fathers and their husbands to cry unto the Lord from the ground, for vengeance upon your heads?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.3'>Then will ye longer deny the Christ, or can ye behold the Lamb of God? Do ye suppose that ye shall dwell with him under a consciousness of your guilt? Do ye suppose that ye could be happy to dwell with that holy Being, when your souls are racked with a consciousness of guilt that ye have ever abused his laws?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.4'>Behold, I say unto you that ye would be more miserable to dwell with a holy and just God, under a consciousness of your filthiness before him, than ye would to dwell with the damned souls in hell.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.12'>Behold, he created Adam, and by Adam came the fall of man. And because of the fall of man came Jesus Christ, even the Father and the Son; and because of Jesus Christ came the redemption of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.13'>And because of the redemption of man, which came by Jesus Christ, they are brought back into the presence of the Lord; yea, this is wherein all men are redeemed, because the death of Christ bringeth to pass the resurrection, which bringeth to pass a redemption from an endless sleep, from which sleep all men shall be awakened by the power of God when the trump shall sound; and they shall come forth, both small and great, and all shall stand before his bar, being redeemed and loosed from this eternal band of death, which death is a temporal death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.15'>And now, O all ye that have imagined up unto yourselves a god who can do no miracles, I would ask of you, have all these things passed, of which I have spoken? Has the end come yet? Behold I say unto you, Nay; and God has not ceased to be a God of miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.16'>Behold, are not the things that God hath wrought marvelous in our eyes? Yea, and who can comprehend the marvelous works of God?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.20'>And the reason why he ceaseth to do miracles among the children of men is because that they dwindle in unbelief, and depart from the right way, and know not the God in whom they should trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.21'>Behold, I say unto you that whoso believeth in Christ, doubting nothing, whatsoever he shall ask the Father in the name of Christ it shall be granted him; and this promise is unto all, even unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.22'>For behold, thus said Jesus Christ, the Son of God, unto his disciples who should tarry, yea, and also to all his disciples, in the hearing of the multitude: Go ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.9.32'>And now, behold, we have written this record according to our knowledge, in the characters which are called among us the reformed Egyptian, being handed down and altered by us, according to our manner of speech.</verse>

And these are my thoughts upon the land which I shall give you for your inheritance; for it shall be a land choice above all other lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>And the Lord said: Go to work and build, after the manner of barges which ye have hitherto built. And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did go to work, and also his brethren, and built barges after the manner which they had built, according to the instructions of the Lord. And they were small, and they were light upon the water, even like unto the lightness of a fowl upon the water.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared cried unto the Lord, saying: O Lord, I have performed the work which thou hast commanded me, and I have made the barges according as thou hast directed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.19'>And behold, O Lord, in them there is no light; whither shall we steer? And also we shall perish, for in them we cannot breathe, save it is the air which is in them; therefore we shall perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.20'>And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt make a hole in the top, and also in the bottom; and when thou shalt suffer for air thou shalt unstop the hole and receive air. And if it be so that the water come in upon thee, behold, ye shall stop the hole, that ye may not perish in the flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.21'>And it came to pass that the brother of Jared did so, according as the Lord had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.22'>And he cried again unto the Lord saying: O Lord, behold I have done even as thou hast commanded me; and I have prepared the vessels for my people, and behold there is no light in them. Behold, O Lord, wilt thou suffer that we shall cross this great water in darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.23'>And the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: What will ye that I should do that ye may have light in your vessels? For behold, ye cannot have windows, for they will be dashed in pieces; neither shall ye take fire with you, for ye shall not go by the light of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.24'>For behold, ye shall be as a whale in the midst of the sea; for the mountain waves shall dash upon you. Nevertheless, I will bring you up again out of the depths of the sea; for the winds have gone forth out of my mouth, and also the rains and the floods have I sent forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.25'>And behold, I prepare you against these things; for ye cannot cross this great deep save I prepare you against the waves of the sea, and the winds which have gone forth, and the floods which shall come. Therefore what will ye that I should prepare for you that ye may have light when ye are swallowed up in the depths of the sea?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>AND it came to pass that the brother of Jared, (now the number of the vessels which had been prepared was eight) went forth unto the mount, which they called the mount Shelem, because of its exceeding height, and did molten out of a rock sixteen small stones; and they were white and clear, even as transparent glass; and he did carry them in his hands upon the top of the mount, and cried again unto the Lord, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>O Lord, thou hast said that we must be encompassed about by the floods. Now behold, O Lord, and do not be angry with thy servant because of his weakness before thee; for we know that thou art holy and dwellest in the heavens, and that we are unworthy before thee; because of the fall our natures have become evil continually; nevertheless, O Lord, thou hast given us a commandment that we must call upon thee, that from thee we may receive according to our desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>Behold, O Lord, thou hast smitten us because of our iniquity, and hast driven us forth, and for these many years we have been in the wilderness; nevertheless, thou hast been merciful unto us. O Lord, look upon me in pity, and turn away thine anger from this thy people, and suffer not that they shall go forth across this raging deep in darkness; but behold these things which I have molten out of the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And I know, O Lord, that thou hast all power, and can do whatsoever thou wilt for the benefit of man; therefore touch these stones, O Lord, with thy finger, and prepare them that they may shine forth in darkness; and they shall shine forth unto us in the vessels which we have prepared, that we may have light while we shall cross the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>Behold, O Lord, thou canst do this. We know that thou art able to show forth great power, which looks small unto the understanding of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And it came to pass that when the brother of Jared had said these words, behold, the Lord stretched forth his hand and touched the stones one by one with his finger. And the veil was taken from off the eyes of the brother of Jared, and he saw the finger of the Lord; and it was as the finger of a man, like unto flesh and blood; and the brother of Jared fell down before the Lord, for he was struck with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>And the Lord saw that the brother of Jared had fallen to the earth; and the Lord said unto him: Arise, why hast thou fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he saith unto the Lord: I saw the finger of the Lord, and I feared lest he should smite me; for I knew not that the Lord had flesh and blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>And the Lord said unto him: Because of thy faith thou hast seen that I shall take upon me flesh and blood; and never has man come before me with such exceeding faith as thou hast; for were it not so ye could not have seen my finger. Sawest thou more than this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And he answered: Nay; Lord, show thyself unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And the Lord said unto him: Believest thou the words which I shall speak?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>And he answered: Yea, Lord, I know that thou speakest the truth, for thou art a God of truth, and canst not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>And when he had said these words, behold, the Lord showed himself unto him, and said: Because thou knowest these things ye are redeemed from the fall; therefore ye are brought back into my presence; therefore I show myself unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>Behold, I am he who was prepared from the foundation of the world to redeem my people. Behold, I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son. In me shall all mankind have life, and that eternally, even they who shall believe on my name; and they shall become my sons and my daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>And never have I showed myself unto man whom I have created, for never has man believed in me as thou hast. Seest thou that ye are created after mine own image? Yea, even all men were created in the beginning after mine own image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>Behold, this body, which ye now behold, is the body of my spirit; and man have I created after the body of my spirit; and even as I appear unto thee to be in the spirit will I appear unto my people in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And now, as I, Moroni, said I could not make a full account of these things which are written, therefore it sufficeth me to say that Jesus showed himself unto this man in the spirit, even after the manner and in the likeness of the same body even as he showed himself unto the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.18'>And he ministered unto him even as he ministered unto the Nephites; and all this, that this man might know that he was God, because of the many great works which the Lord had showed unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.19'>And because of the knowledge of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the veil; and he saw the finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he had faith no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.20'>Wherefore, having this perfect knowledge of God, he could not be kept from within the veil; therefore he saw Jesus; and he did minister unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.21'>And it came to pass that the Lord said unto the brother of Jared: Behold, thou shalt not suffer these things which ye have seen and heard to go forth unto the world, until the time cometh that I shall glorify my name in the flesh; wherefore, ye shall treasure up the things which ye have seen and heard, and show it to no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.22'>And behold, when ye shall come unto me, ye shall write them and shall seal them up, that no one can interpret them; for ye shall write them in a language that they cannot be read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.23'>And behold, these two stones will I give unto thee, and ye shall seal them up also with the things which ye shall write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.24'>For behold, the language which ye shall write I have confounded; wherefore I will cause in my own due time that these stones shall magnify to the eyes of men these things which ye shall write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.25'>And when the Lord had said these words, he showed unto the brother of Jared all the inhabitants of the earth which had been, and also all that would be; and he withheld them not from his sight, even unto the ends of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.26'>For he had said unto him in times before, that if he would believe in him that he could show unto him all things-it should be shown unto him; therefore the Lord could not withhold anything from him, for he knew that the Lord could show him all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.27'>And the Lord said unto him: Write these things and seal them up; and I will show them in mine own due time unto the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.28'>And it came to pass that the Lord commanded him that he should seal up the two stones which he had received, and show them not, until the Lord should show them unto the children of men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>AND the Lord commanded the brother of Jared to go down out of the mount from the presence of the Lord, and write the things which he had seen; and they were forbidden to come unto the children of men until after that he should be lifted up upon the cross; and for this cause did king Mosiah keep them, that they should not come unto the world until after Christ should show himself unto his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>And after Christ truly had showed himself unto his people he commanded that they should be made manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And now, after that, they have all dwindled in unbelief; and there is none save it be the Lamanites, and they have rejected the gospel of Christ; therefore I am commanded that I should hide them up again in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>Behold, I have written upon these plates the very things which the brother of Jared saw; and there never were greater things made manifest than those which were made manifest unto the brother of Jared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>Wherefore the Lord hath commanded me to write them; and I have written them. And he commanded me that I should seal them up; and he also hath commanded that I should seal up the interpretation thereof; wherefore I have sealed up the interpreters, according to the commandment of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>For the Lord said unto me: They shall not go forth unto the Gentiles until the day that they shall repent of their iniquity, and become clean before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And in that day that they shall exercise faith in me, saith the Lord, even as the brother of Jared did, that they may become sanctified in me, then will I manifest unto them the things which the brother of Jared saw, even to the unfolding unto them all my revelations, saith Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the Father of the heavens and of the earth, and all things that in them are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>And he that will contend against the word of the Lord, let him be accursed; and he that shall deny these things, let him be accursed; for unto them will I show no greater things, saith Jesus Christ; for I am he who speaketh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>And at my command the heavens are opened and are shut; and at my word the earth shall shake; and at my command the inhabitants thereof shall pass away, even so as by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>And he that believeth not my words believeth not my disciples; and if it so be that I do not speak, judge ye; for ye shall know that it is I that speaketh, at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>But he that believeth these things which I have spoken, him will I visit with the manifestations of my Spirit, and he shall know and bear record. For because of my Spirit he shall know that these things are true; for it persuadeth men to do good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>And whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do good is of me; for good cometh of none save it be of me. I am the same that leadeth men to all good; he that will not believe my words will not believe me-that I am; and he that will not believe me will not believe the Father who sent me. For behold, I am the Father, I am the light, and the life, and the truth of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>Come unto me, O ye Gentiles, and I will show unto you the greater things, the knowledge which is hid up because of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>Come unto me, O ye house of Israel, and it shall be made manifest unto you how great things the Father hath laid up for you, from the foundation of the world; and it hath not come unto you, because of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>Behold, when ye shall rend that veil of unbelief which doth cause you to remain in your awful state of wickedness, and hardness of heart, and blindness of mind, then shall the great and marvelous things which have been hid up from the foundation of the world from you-yea, when ye shall call upon the Father in my name, with a broken heart and a contrite spirit, then shall ye know that the Father hath remembered the covenant which he made unto your fathers, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>And then shall my revelations which I have caused to be written by my servant John be unfolded in the eyes of all the people. Remember, when ye see these things, ye shall know that the time is at hand that they shall be made manifest in very deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>Therefore, when ye shall receive this record ye may know that the work of the Father has commenced upon all the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>Therefore, repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and believe in my gospel, and be baptized in my name; for he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be damned; and signs shall follow them that believe in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>And blessed is he that is found faithful unto my name at the last day, for he shall be lifted up to dwell in the kingdom prepared for him from the foundation of the world. And behold it is I that hath spoken it. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>AND now I, Moroni, have written the words which were commanded me, according to my memory; and I have told you the things which I have sealed up; therefore touch them not in order that ye may translate; for that thing is forbidden you, except by and by it shall be wisdom in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>And behold, ye may be privileged that ye may show the plates unto those who shall assist to bring forth this work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>And unto three shall they be shown by the power of God; wherefore they shall know of a surety that these things are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established; and the testimony of three, and this work, in the which shall be shown forth the power of God and also his word, of which the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Ghost bear record-and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And if it so be that they repent and come unto the Father in the name of Jesus, they shall be received into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>And now, if I have no authority for these things, judge ye; for ye shall know that I have authority when ye shall see me, and we shall stand before God at the last day. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>AND now I, Moroni, proceed to give the record of Jared and his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>For it came to pass after the Lord had prepared the stones which the brother of Jared had carried up into the mount, the brother of Jared came down out of the mount, and he did put forth the stones into the vessels which were prepared, one in each end thereof; and behold, they did give light unto the vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And thus the Lord caused stones to shine in darkness, to give light unto men, women, and children, that they might not cross the great waters in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And it came to pass that when they had prepared all manner of food, that thereby they might subsist upon the water, and also food for their flocks and herds, and whatsoever beast or animal or fowl that they should carry with them-and it came to pass that when they had done all these things they got aboard of their vessels or barges, and set forth into the sea, commending themselves unto the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>And it came to pass that the Lord God caused that there should be a furious wind blow upon the face of the waters, towards the promised land; and thus they were tossed upon the waves of the sea before the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>And it came to pass that they were many times buried in the depths of the sea, because of the mountain waves which broke upon them, and also the great and terrible tempests which were caused by the fierceness of the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>And it came to pass that when they were buried in the deep there was no water that could hurt them, their vessels being tight like unto a dish, and also they were tight like unto the ark of Noah; therefore when they were encompassed about by many waters they did cry unto the Lord, and he did bring them forth again upon the top of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>And it came to pass that the wind did never cease to blow towards the promised land while they were upon the waters; and thus they were driven forth before the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>And they did sing praises unto the Lord; yea, the brother of Jared did sing praises unto the Lord, and he did thank and praise the Lord all the day long; and when the night came, they did not cease to praise the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>And thus they were driven forth; and no monster of the sea could break them, neither whale that could mar them; and they did have light continually, whether it was above the water or under the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And thus they were driven forth, three hundred and forty and four days upon the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>And they did land upon the shore of the promised land. And when they had set their feet upon the shores of the promised land they bowed themselves down upon the face of the land, and did humble themselves before the Lord, and did shed tears of joy before the Lord, because of the multitude of his tender mercies over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>And it came to pass that they went forth upon the face of the land, and began to till the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>And Jared had four sons; and they were called Jacom, and Gilgah, and Mahah, and Orihah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>And the brother of Jared also begat sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>And the friends of Jared and his brother were in number about twenty and two souls; and they also begat sons and daughters before they came to the promised land; and therefore they began to be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>And they were taught to walk humbly before the Lord; and they were also taught from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>And it came to pass that they began to spread upon the face of the land, and to multiply and to till the earth; and they did wax strong in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>And the brother of Jared began to be old, and saw that he must soon go down to the grave; wherefore he said unto Jared: Let us gather together our people that we may number them, that we may know of them what they will desire of us before we go down to our graves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>And accordingly the people were gathered together. Now the number of the sons and the daughters of the brother of Jared were twenty and two souls; and the number of sons and daughters of Jared were twelve, he having four sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>And it came to pass that they did number their people; and after that they had numbered them, they did desire of them the things which they would that they should do before they went down to their graves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.22'>And it came to pass that the people desired of them that they should anoint one of their sons to be a king over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.23'>And now behold, this was grievous unto them. And the brother of Jared said unto them: Surely this thing leadeth into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.24'>But Jared said unto his brother: Suffer them that they may have a king. And therefore he said unto them: Choose ye out from among our sons a king, even whom ye will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.25'>And it came to pass that they chose even the firstborn of the brother of Jared; and his name was Pagag. And it came to pass that he refused and would not be their king. And the people would that his father should constrain him, but his father would not; and he commanded them that they should constrain no man to be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.26'>And it came to pass that they chose all the brothers of Pagag, and they would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.27'>And it came to pass that neither would the sons of Jared, even all save it were one; and Orihah was anointed to be king over the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.28'>And he began to reign, and the people began to prosper; and they became exceedingly rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.29'>And it came to pass that Jared died, and his brother also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.30'>And it came to pass that Orihah did walk humbly before the Lord, and did remember how great things the Lord had done for his father, and also taught his people how great things the Lord had done for their fathers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.1'>AND it came to pass that Orihah did execute judgment upon the land in righteousness all his days, whose days were exceedingly many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.2'>And he begat sons and daughters; yea, he begat thirty and one, among whom were twenty and three sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.3'>And it came to pass that he also begat Kib in his old age. And it came to pass that Kib reigned in his stead; and Kib begat Corihor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.4'>And when Corihor was thirty and two years old he rebelled against his father, and went over and dwelt in the land of Nehor; and he begat sons and daughters, and they became exceedingly fair; wherefore Corihor drew away many people after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.5'>And when he had gathered together an army he came up unto the land of Moron where the king dwelt, and took him captive, which brought to pass the saying of the brother of Jared that they would be brought into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.6'>Now the land of Moron, where the king dwelt, was near the land which is called Desolation by the Nephites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.7'>And it came to pass that Kib dwelt in captivity, and his people under Corihor his son, until he became exceedingly old; nevertheless Kib begat Shule in his old age, while he was yet in captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.8'>And it came to pass that Shule was angry with his brother; and Shule waxed strong, and became mighty as to the strength of a man; and he was also mighty in judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.9'>Wherefore, he came to the hill Ephraim, and he did molten out of the hill, and made swords out of steel for those whom he had drawn away with him; and after he had armed them with swords he returned to the city Nehor, and gave battle unto his brother Corihor, by which means he obtained the kingdom and restored it unto his father Kib.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.10'>And now because of the thing which Shule had done, his father bestowed upon him the kingdom; therefore he began to reign in the stead of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.11'>And it came to pass that he did execute judgment in righteousness; and he did spread his kingdom upon all the face of the land, for the people had become exceedingly numerous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.12'>And it came to pass that Shule also begat many sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.13'>And Corihor repented of the many evils which he had done; wherefore Shule gave him power in his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.14'>And it came to pass that Corihor had many sons and daughters. And among the sons of Corihor there was one whose name was Noah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.15'>And it came to pass that Noah rebelled against Shule, the king, and also his father Corihor, and drew away Cohor his brother, and also all his brethren and many of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.16'>And he gave battle unto Shule, the king, in which he did obtain the land of their first inheritance; and he became a king over that part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.17'>And it came to pass that he gave battle again unto Shule, the king; and he took Shule, the king, and carried him away captive into Moron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.18'>And it came to pass as he was about to put him to death, the sons of Shule crept into the house of Noah by night and slew him, and broke down the door of the prison and brought out their father, and placed him upon his throne in his own kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.19'>Wherefore, the son of Noah did build up his kingdom in his stead; nevertheless they did not gain power any more over Shule the king, and the people who were under the reign of Shule the king did prosper exceedingly and wax great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.20'>And the country was divided; and there were two kingdoms, the kingdom of Shule, and the kingdom of Cohor, the son of Noah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.21'>And Cohor, the son of Noah, caused that his people should give battle unto Shule, in which Shule did beat them and did slay Cohor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.22'>And now Cohor had a son who was called Nimrod; and Nimrod gave up the kingdom of Cohor unto Shule, and he did gain favor in the eyes of Shule; wherefore Shule did bestow great favors upon him, and he did do in the kingdom of Shule according to his desires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.23'>And also in the reign of Shule there came prophets among the people, who were sent from the Lord, prophesying that the wickedness and idolatry of the people was bringing a curse upon the land, and they should be destroyed if they did not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.24'>And it came to pass that the people did revile against the prophets, and did mock them. And it came to pass that king Shule did execute judgment against all those who did revile against the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.25'>And he did execute a law throughout all the land, which gave power unto the prophets that they should go whithersoever they would; and by this cause the people were brought unto repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.26'>And because the people did repent of their iniquities and idolatries the Lord did spare them, and they began to prosper again in the land. And it came to pass that Shule begat sons and daughters in his old age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.27'>And there were no more wars in the days of Shule; and he remembered the great things that the Lord had done for his fathers in bringing them across the great deep into the promised land; wherefore he did execute judgment in righteousness all his days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.1'>AND it came to pass that he begat Omer, and Omer reigned in his stead. And Omer begat Jared; and Jared begat sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.2'>And Jared rebelled against his father, and came and dwelt in the land of Heth. And it came to pass that he did flatter many people, because of his cunning words, until he had gained the half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.3'>And when he had gained the half of the kingdom he gave battle unto his father, and he did carry away his father into captivity, and did make him serve in captivity;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.9'>And it came to pass that they fought an exceedingly sore battle, in which Coriantumr was wounded again, and he fainted with the loss of blood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.11'>And it came to pass that the army of Coriantumr did pitch their tents by the hill Ramah; and it was that same hill where my father Mormon did hide up the records unto the Lord, which were sacred.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.14'>Wherefore, they were for the space of four years gathering together the people, that they might get all who were upon the face of the land, and that they might receive all the strength which it was possible that they could receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.15'>And it came to pass that when they were all gathered together, every one to the army which he would, with their wives and their children-both men, women and children being armed with weapons of war, having shields, and breastplates, and head-plates, and being clothed after the manner of war-they did march forth one against another to battle; and they fought all that day, and conquered not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.16'>And it came to pass that when it was night they were weary, and retired to their camps; and after they had retired to their camps they took up a howling and a lamentation for the loss of the slain of their people; and so great were their cries, their howlings and lamentations, that they did rend the air exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.17'>And it came to pass that on the morrow they did go again to battle, and great and terrible was that day; nevertheless, they conquered not, and when the night came again they did rend the air with their cries, and their howlings, and their mournings, for the loss of the slain of their people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.18'>And it came to pass that Coriantumr wrote again an epistle unto Shiz, desiring that he would not come again to battle, but that he would take the kingdom, and spare the lives of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.19'>But behold, the Spirit of the Lord had ceased striving with them, and Satan had full power over the hearts of the people; for they were given up unto the hardness of their hearts, and the blindness of their minds that they might be destroyed; wherefore they went again to battle.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.22'>And when the night came they were drunken with anger, even as a man who is drunken with wine; and they slept again upon their swords.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.29'>Wherefore, he did pursue them, and on the morrow he did overtake them; and they fought again with the sword. And it came to pass that when they had all fallen by the sword, save it were Coriantumr and Shiz, behold Shiz had fainted with the loss of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.30'>And it came to pass that when Coriantumr had leaned upon his sword, that he rested a little, he smote off the head of Shiz.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.5'>And the church did meet together oft, to fast and to pray, and to speak one with another concerning the welfare of their souls.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.1'>AND now I, Moroni, write a few of the words of my father Mormon, which he spake concerning faith, hope, and charity; for after this manner did he speak unto the people, as he taught them in the synagogue which they had built for the place of worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.2'>And now I, Mormon, speak unto you, my beloved brethren; and it is by the grace of God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, and his holy will, because of the gift of his calling unto me, that I am permitted to speak unto you at this time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.3'>Wherefore, I would speak unto you that are of the church, that are the peaceable followers of Christ, and that have obtained a sufficient hope by which ye can enter into the rest of the Lord, from this time henceforth until ye shall rest with him in heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.5'>For I remember the word of God which saith by their works ye shall know them; for if their works be good, then they are good also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.6'>For behold, God hath said a man being evil cannot do that which is good; for if he offereth a gift, or prayeth unto God, except he shall do it with real intent it profiteth him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.7'>For behold, it is not counted unto him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.8'>For behold, if a man being evil giveth a gift, he doeth it grudgingly; wherefore it is counted unto him the same as if he had retained the gift; wherefore he is counted evil before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.9'>And likewise also is it counted evil unto a man, if he shall pray and not with real intent of heart; yea, and it profiteth him nothing, for God receiveth none such.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.10'>Wherefore, a man being evil cannot do that which is good; neither will he give a good gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.11'>For behold, a bitter fountain cannot bring forth good water; neither can a good fountain bring forth bitter water; wherefore, a man being a servant of the devil cannot follow Christ; and if he follow Christ he cannot be a servant of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.12'>Wherefore, all things which are good cometh of God; and that which is evil cometh of the devil; for the devil is an enemy unto God, and fighteth against him continually, and inviteth and enticeth to sin, and to do that which is evil continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.13'>But behold, that which is of God inviteth and enticeth to do good continually; wherefore, every thing which inviteth and enticeth to do good, and to love God, and to serve him, is inspired of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.14'>Wherefore, take heed, my beloved brethren, that ye do not judge that which is evil to be of God, or that which is good and of God to be of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.15'>For behold, my brethren, it is given unto you to judge, that ye may know good from evil; and the way to judge is as plain, that ye may know with a perfect knowledge, as the daylight is from the dark night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.16'>For behold, the Spirit of Christ is given to every man, that he may know good from evil; wherefore, I show unto you the way to judge; for every thing which inviteth to do good, and to persuade to believe in Christ, is sent forth by the power and gift of Christ; wherefore ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.17'>But whatsoever thing persuadeth men to do evil, and believe not in Christ, and deny him, and serve not God, then ye may know with a perfect knowledge it is of the devil; for after this manner doth the devil work, for he persuadeth no man to do good, no, not one; neither do his angels; neither do they who subject themselves unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.18'>And now, my brethren, seeing that ye know the light by which ye may judge, which light is the light of Christ, see that ye do not judge wrongfully; for with that same judgment which ye judge ye shall also be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.19'>Wherefore, I beseech of you, brethren, that ye should search diligently in the light of Christ that ye may know good from evil; and if ye will lay hold upon every good thing, and condemn it not, ye certainly will be a child of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.20'>And now, my brethren, how is it possible that ye can lay hold upon every good thing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.21'>And now I come to that faith, of which I said I would speak; and I will tell you the way whereby ye may lay hold on every good thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.22'>For behold, God knowing all things, being from everlasting to everlasting, behold, he sent angels to minister unto the children of men, to make manifest concerning the coming of Christ; and in Christ there should come every good thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.23'>And God also declared unto prophets, by his own mouth, that Christ should come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.24'>And behold, there were divers ways that he did manifest things unto the children of men, which were good; and all things which are good cometh of Christ; otherwise men were fallen, and there could no good thing come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.25'>Wherefore, by the ministering of angels, and by every word which proceeded forth out of the mouth of God, men began to exercise faith in Christ; and thus by faith, they did lay hold upon every good thing; and thus it was until the coming of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.26'>And after that he came men also were saved by faith in his name; and by faith, they become the sons of God. And as surely as Christ liveth he spake these words unto our fathers, saying: Whatsoever thing ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is good, in faith believing that ye shall receive, behold, it shall be done unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.27'>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased because Christ hath ascended into heaven, and hath sat down on the right hand of God, to claim of the Father his rights of mercy which he hath upon the children of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.28'>For he hath answered the ends of the law, and he claimeth all those who have faith in him; and they who have faith in him will cleave unto every good thing; wherefore he advocateth the cause of the children of men; and he dwelleth eternally in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.29'>And because he hath done this, my beloved brethren, have miracles ceased? Behold I say unto you, Nay; neither have angels ceased to minister unto the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.30'>For behold, they are subject unto him, to minister according to the word of his command, showing themselves unto them of strong faith and a firm mind in every form of godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.31'>And the office of their ministry is to call men unto repentance, and to fulfil and to do the work of the covenants of the Father, which he hath made unto the children of men, to prepare the way among the children of men, by declaring the word of Christ unto the chosen vessels of the Lord, that they may bear testimony of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.32'>And by so doing, the Lord God prepareth the way that the residue of men may have faith in Christ, that the Holy Ghost may have place in their hearts, according to the power thereof; and after this manner bringeth to pass the Father, the covenants which he hath made unto the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.33'>And Christ hath said: If ye will have faith in me ye shall have power to do whatsoever thing is expedient in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.34'>And he hath said: Repent all ye ends of the earth, and come unto me, and be baptized in my name, and have faith in me, that ye may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.35'>And now, my beloved brethren, if this be the case that these things are true which I have spoken unto you, and God will show unto you, with power and great glory at the last day, that they are true, and if they are true has the day of miracles ceased?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.36'>Or have angels ceased to appear unto the children of men? Or has he withheld the power of the Holy Ghost from them? Or will he, so long as time shall last, or the earth shall stand, or there shall be one man upon the face thereof to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.37'>Behold I say unto you, Nay; for it is by faith that miracles are wrought; and it is by faith that angels appear and minister unto men; wherefore, if these things have ceased wo be unto the children of men, for it is because of unbelief, and all is vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.38'>For no man can be saved, according to the words of Christ, save they shall have faith in his name; wherefore, if these things have ceased, then has faith ceased also; and awful is the state of man, for they are as though there had been no redemption made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.39'>But behold, my beloved brethren, I judge better things of you, for I judge that ye have faith in Christ because of your meekness; for if ye have not faith in him then ye are not fit to be numbered among the people of his church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.40'>And again, my beloved brethren, I would speak unto you concerning hope. How is it that ye can attain unto faith, save ye shall have hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.41'>And what is it that ye shall hope for? Behold I say unto you that ye shall have hope through the atonement of Christ and the power of his resurrection, to be raised unto life eternal, and this because of your faith in him according to the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.42'>Wherefore, if a man have faith he must needs have hope; for without faith there cannot be any hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.43'>And again, behold I say unto you that he cannot have faith and hope, save he shall be meek, and lowly of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.44'>If so, his faith and hope is vain, for none is acceptable before God, save the meek and lowly in heart; and if a man be meek and lowly in heart, and confesses by the power of the Holy Ghost that Jesus is the Christ, he must needs have charity; for if he have not charity he is nothing; wherefore he must needs have charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.45'>And charity suffereth long, and is kind, and envieth not, and is not puffed up, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil, and rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth, beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.46'>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, if ye have not charity, ye are nothing, for charity never faileth. Wherefore, cleave unto charity, which is the greatest of all, for all things must fail-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.47'>But charity is the pure love of Christ, and it endureth forever; and whoso is found possessed of it at the last day, it shall be well with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.48'>Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure.

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.1'>AN epistle of my father Mormon, written to me, Moroni; and it was written unto me soon after my calling to the ministry. And on this wise did he write unto me, saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.3'>I am mindful of you always in my prayers, continually praying unto God the Father in the name of his Holy Child, Jesus, that he, through his infinite goodness and grace, will keep you through the endurance of faith on his name to the end.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.6'>And now, my son, I desire that ye should labor diligently, that this gross error should be removed from among you; for, for this intent I have written this epistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.7'>For immediately after I had learned these things of you I inquired of the Lord concerning the matter. And the word of the Lord came to me by the power of the Holy Ghost, saying:</verse>

Behold, I came into the world not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance; the whole need no physician, but they that are sick; wherefore, little children are whole, for they are not capable of committing sin; wherefore the curse of Adam is taken from them in me, that it hath no power over them; and the law of circumcision is done away in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.9'>And after this manner did the Holy Ghost manifest the word of God unto me; wherefore, my beloved son, I know that it is solemn mockery before God, that ye should baptize little children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.10'>Behold I say unto you that this thing shall ye teach-repentance and baptism unto those who are accountable and capable of committing sin; yea, teach parents that they must repent and be baptized, and humble themselves as their little children, and they shall all be saved with their little children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.11'>And their little children need no repentance, neither baptism. Behold, baptism is unto repentance to the fulfilling the commandments unto the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.12'>But little children are alive in Christ, even from the foundation of the world; if not so, God is a partial God, and also a changeable God, and a respecter to persons; for how many little children have died without baptism!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.13'>Wherefore, if little children could not be saved without baptism, these must have gone to an endless hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.14'>Behold I say unto you, that he that supposeth that little children need baptism is in the gall of bitterness and in the bonds of iniquity; for he hath neither faith, hope, nor charity; wherefore, should he be cut off while in the thought, he must go down to hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.15'>For awful is the wickedness to suppose that God saveth one child because of baptism, and the other must perish because he hath no baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.16'>Wo be unto them that shall pervert the ways of the Lord after this manner, for they shall perish except they repent. Behold, I speak with boldness, having authority from God; and I fear not what man can do; for perfect love casteth out all fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.17'>And I am filled with charity, which is everlasting love; wherefore, all children are alike unto me; wherefore, I love little children with a perfect love; and they are all alike and partakers of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.18'>For I know that God is not a partial God, neither a changeable being; but he is unchangeable from all eternity to all eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.19'>Little children cannot repent; wherefore, it is awful wickedness to deny the pure mercies of God unto them, for they are all alive in him because of his mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.20'>And he that saith that little children need baptism denieth the mercies of Christ, and setteth at naught the atonement of him and the power of his redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.21'>Wo unto such, for they are in danger of death, hell, and an endless torment. I speak it boldly; God hath commanded me. Listen unto them and give heed, or they stand against you at the judgment-seat of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.22'>For behold that all little children are alive in Christ, and also all they that are without the law. For the power of redemption cometh on all them that have no law; wherefore, he that is not condemned, or he that is under no condemnation, cannot repent; and unto such baptism availeth nothing-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.23'>But it is mockery before God, denying the mercies of Christ, and the power of his Holy Spirit, and putting trust in dead works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.24'>Behold, my son, this thing ought not to be; for repentance is unto them that are under condemnation and under the curse of a broken law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.25'>And the first fruits of repentance is baptism; and baptism cometh by faith unto the fulfilling the commandments; and the fulfilling the commandments bringeth remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.26'>And the remission of sins bringeth meekness, and lowliness of heart; and because of meekness and lowliness of heart cometh the visitation of the Holy Ghost, which Comforter filleth with hope and perfect love, which love endureth by diligence unto prayer, until the end shall come, when all the saints shall dwell with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.27'>Behold, my son, I will write unto you again if I go not out soon against the Lamanites. Behold, the pride of this nation, or the people of the Nephites, hath proven their destruction except they should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.28'>Pray for them, my son, that repentance may come unto them. But behold, I fear lest the Spirit hath ceased striving with them; and in this part of the land they are also seeking to put down all power and authority which cometh from God; and they are denying the Holy Ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.29'>And after rejecting so great a knowledge, my son, they must perish soon, unto the fulfilling of the prophecies which were spoken by the prophets, as well as the words of our Savior himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.30'>Farewell, my son, until I shall write unto you, or shall meet you again. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.1'>My beloved son, I write unto you again that ye may know that I am yet alive; but I write somewhat of that which is grievous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.2'>For behold, I have had a sore battle with the Lamanites, in which we did not conquer; and Archeantus has fallen by the sword, and also Luram and Emron; yea, and we have lost a great number of our choice men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.3'>And now behold, my son, I fear lest the Lamanites shall destroy this people; for they do not repent, and Satan stirreth them up continually to anger one with another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.4'>Behold, I am laboring with them continually; and when I speak the word of God with sharpness they tremble and anger against me; and when I use no sharpness they harden their hearts against it; wherefore, I fear lest the Spirit of the Lord hath ceased striving with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.5'>For so exceedingly do they anger that it seemeth me that they have no fear of death; and they have lost their love, one towards another; and they thirst after blood and revenge continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.6'>And now, my beloved son, notwithstanding their hardness, let us labor diligently; for if we should cease to labor, we should be brought under condemnation; for we have a labor to perform whilst in this tabernacle of clay, that we may conquer the enemy of all righteousness, and rest our souls in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.7'>And now I write somewhat concerning the sufferings of this people. For according to the knowledge which I have received from Amoron, behold, the Lamanites have many prisoners, which they took from the tower of Sherrizah; and there were men, women, and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.8'>And the husbands and fathers of those women and children they have slain; and they feed the women upon the flesh of their husbands, and the children upon the flesh of their fathers; and no water, save a little, do they give unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.9'>And notwithstanding this great abomination of the Lamanites, it doth not exceed that of our people in Moriantum. For behold, many of the daughters of the Lamanites have they taken prisoners; and after depriving them of that which was most dear and precious above all things, which is chastity and virtue-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.10'>And after they had done this thing, they did murder them in a most cruel manner, torturing their bodies even unto death; and after they have done this, they devour their flesh like unto wild beasts, because of the hardness of their hearts; and they do it for a token of bravery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.11'>O my beloved son, how can a people like this, that are without civilization-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.12'>(And only a few years have passed away, and they were a civil and a delightsome people)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.13'>But O my son, how can a people like this, whose delight is in so much abomination-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.14'>How can we expect that God will stay his hand in judgment against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.15'>Behold, my heart cries: Wo unto this people. Come out in judgment, O God, and hide their sins, and wickedness, and abominations from before thy face!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.16'>And again, my son, there are many widows and their daughters who remain in Sherrizah; and that part of the provisions which the Lamanites did not carry away, behold, the army of Zenephi has carried away, and left them to wander whithersoever they can for food; and many old women do faint by the way and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.17'>And the army which is with me is weak; and the armies of the Lamanites are betwixt Sherrizah and me; and as many as have fled to the army of Aaron have fallen victims to their awful brutality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.18'>O the depravity of my people! They are without order and without mercy. Behold, I am but a man, and I have but the strength of a man, and I cannot any longer enforce my commands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.19'>And they have become strong in their perversion; and they are alike brutal, sparing none, neither old nor young; and they delight in everything save that which is good; and the suffering of our women and our children upon all the face of this land doth exceed everything; yea, tongue cannot tell, neither can it be written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.20'>And now, my son, I dwell no longer upon this horrible scene. Behold, thou knowest the wickedness of this people; thou knowest that they are without principle, and past feeling; and their wickedness doth exceed that of the Lamanites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.21'>Behold, my son, I cannot recommend them unto God lest he should smite me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.22'>But behold, my son, I recommend thee unto God, and I trust in Christ that thou wilt be saved; and I pray unto God that he will spare thy life, to witness the return of his people unto him, or their utter destruction; for I know that they must perish except they repent and return unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.23'>And if they perish it will be like unto the Jaredites, because of the wilfulness of their hearts, seeking for blood and revenge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.24'>And if it so be that they perish, we know that many of our brethren have deserted over unto the Lamanites, and many more will also desert over unto them; wherefore, write somewhat a few things, if thou art spared and I shall perish and not see thee; but I trust that I may see thee soon; for I have sacred records that I would deliver up unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.25'>My son, be faithful in Christ; and may not the things which I have written grieve thee, to weigh thee down unto death; but may Christ lift thee up, and may his sufferings and death, and the showing his body unto our fathers, and his mercy and long-suffering, and the hope of his glory and of eternal life, rest in your mind forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.26'>And may the grace of God the Father, whose throne is high in the heavens, and our Lord Jesus Christ, who sitteth on the right hand of his power, until all things shall become subject unto him, be, and abide with you forever. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.2'>And I seal up these records, after I have spoken a few words by way of exhortation unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.3'>Behold, I would exhort you that when ye shall read these things, if it be wisdom in God that ye should read them, that ye would remember how merciful the Lord hath been unto the children of men, from the creation of Adam even down until the time that ye shall receive these things, and ponder it in your hearts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.7'>And ye may know that he is, by the power of the Holy Ghost; wherefore I would exhort you that ye deny not the power of God; for he worketh by power, according to the faith of the children of men, the same today and tomorrow, and forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.8'>And again, I exhort you, my brethren, that ye deny not the gifts of God, for they are many; and they come from the same God. And there are different ways that these gifts are administered; but it is the same God who worketh all in all; and they are given by the manifestations of the Spirit of God unto men, to profit them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.9'>For behold, to one is given by the Spirit of God, that he may teach the word of wisdom;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.20'>Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.28'>I declare these things unto the fulfilling of the prophecies. And behold, they shall proceed forth out of the mouth of the everlasting God; and his word shall hiss forth from generation to generation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.32'>Yea, come unto Christ, and be perfected in him, and deny yourselves of all ungodliness; and if ye shall deny yourselves of all ungodliness, and love God with all your might, mind and strength, then is his grace sufficient for you, that by his grace ye may be perfect in Christ; and if by the grace of God ye are perfect in Christ, ye can in nowise deny the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.33'>And again, if ye by the grace of God are perfect in Christ, and deny not his power, then are ye sanctified in Christ by the grace of God, through the shedding of the blood of Christ, which is in the covenant of the Father unto the remission of your sins, that ye become holy, without spot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.34'>And now I bid unto all, farewell. I soon go to rest in the paradise of God, until my spirit and body shall again reunite, and I am brought forth triumphant through the air, to meet you before the pleasing bar of the great Jehovah, the Eternal Judge of both quick and dead.

Many revelations had been received from the Lord prior to this time, and the compilation of these for publication in book form was one of the principal subjects passed upon at the conference. This section constitutes the Lord's Preface to the doctrines, covenants, and commandments given in this dispensation.] HEARKEN, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>For verily the voice of the Lord is unto all men, and there is none to escape; and there is no eye that shall not see, neither ear that shall not hear, neither heart that shall not be penetrated.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. HC 1: 37-38. Oliver is admonished to be patient, and is urged to be content to write, for the time being, at the dictation of the translator, rather than to attempt to translate.] BEHOLD, I say unto you, my son, that because you did not translate according to that which you desired of me, and did commence again to write for my servant, Joseph Smith, Jun., even so I would that ye should continue until you have finished this record, which I have entrusted unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.2'>And then, behold, other records have I, that I will give unto you power that you may assist to translate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.3'>Be patient, my son, for it is wisdom in me, and it is not expedient that you should translate at this present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.4'>Behold, the work which you are called to do is to write for my servant Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.5'>And, behold, it is because that you did not continue as you commenced, when you began to translate, that I have taken away this privilege from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.6'>Do not murmur, my son, for it is wisdom in me that I have dealt with you after this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.7'>Behold, you have not understood; you have supposed that I would give it unto you, when you took no thought save it was to ask me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.8'>But, behold, I say unto you, that you must study it out in your mind; then you must ask me if it be right, and if it is right I will cause that your bosom shall burn within you; therefore, you shall feel that it is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.9'>But if it be not right you shall have no such feelings, but you shall have a stupor of thought that shall cause you to forget the thing which is wrong; therefore, you cannot write that which is sacred save it be given you from me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.9.12'>For, do you not behold that I have given unto my servant Joseph sufficient strength, whereby it is made up? And neither of you have I condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.9.13'>Do this thing which I have commanded you, and you shall prosper. Be faithful, and yield to no temptation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.10'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.1'>[Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, in the summer of 1828. HC 1: 20-23. Herein the Lord informs Joseph of alterations made by wicked men in the 116 manuscript pages from the translation of the "Book of Lehi," in the Book of Mormon. These manuscript pages had been lost from the possession of Martin Harris, to whom the sheets had been temporarily entrusted. See heading to Section 3. The evil design was to await the expected retranslation of the matter covered by the stolen pages, and then to discredit the translator by showing discrepancies created by the alterations. That this wicked purpose had been conceived by the evil one, and was known to the Lord even while Mormon, the ancient Nephite historian, was making his abridgment of the accumulated plates, is shown in the Book of Mormon (The Words of Mormon 1: 3-7).] NOW, behold, I say unto you, that because you delivered up those writings which you had power given unto you to translate by the means of the Urim and Thummim, into the hands of a wicked man, you have lost them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.2'>And you also lost your gift at the same time, and your mind became darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.3'>Nevertheless, it is now restored unto you again; therefore see that you are faithful and continue on unto the finishing of the remainder of the work of translation as you have begun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.4'>Do not run faster or labor more than you have strength and means provided to enable you to translate; but be diligent unto the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.5'>Pray always, that you may come off conqueror; yea, that you may conquer Satan, and that you may escape the hands of the servants of Satan that do uphold his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.6'>Behold, they have sought to destroy you; yea, even the man in whom you have trusted has sought to destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.7'>And for this cause I said that he is a wicked man, for he has sought to take away the things wherewith you have been entrusted; and he has also sought to destroy your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.8'>And because you have delivered the writings into his hands, behold, wicked men have taken them from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.9'>Therefore, you have delivered them up, yea, that which was sacred, unto wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.10'>And, behold, Satan hath put it into their hearts to alter the words which you have caused to be written, or which you have translated, which have gone out of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.11'>And behold, I say unto you, that because they have altered the words, they read contrary from that which you translated and caused to be written;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.10.13'>For he hath put into their hearts to do this, that by lying they may say they have caught you in the words which you have pretended to translate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.14'>Verily, I say unto you, that I will not suffer that Satan shall accomplish his evil design in this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.15'>For behold, he has put it into their hearts to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God, in asking to translate it over again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.16'>And then, behold, they say and think in their hearts-We will see if God has given him power to translate; if so, he will also give him power again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.17'>And if God giveth him power again, or if he translates again, or, in other words, if he bringeth forth the same words, behold, we have the same with us, and we have altered them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.18'>Therefore they will not agree, and we will say that he has lied in his words, and that he has no gift, and that he has no power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.19'>Therefore we will destroy him, and also the work; and we will do this that we may not be ashamed in the end, and that we may get glory of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.20'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, that Satan has great hold upon their hearts; he stirreth them up to iniquity against that which is good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.21'>And their hearts are corrupt, and full of wickedness and abominations; and they love darkness rather than light, because their deeds are evil; therefore they will not ask of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.22'>Satan stirreth them up, that he may lead their souls to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.23'>And thus he has laid a cunning plan, thinking to destroy the work of God; but I will require this at their hands, and it shall turn to their shame and condemnation in the day of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.24'>Yea, he stirreth up their hearts to anger against this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.25'>Yea, he saith unto them: Deceive and lie in wait to catch, that ye may destroy; behold, this is no harm. And thus he flattereth them, and telleth them that it is no sin to lie that they may catch a man in a lie, that they may destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.26'>And thus he flattereth them, and leadeth them along until he draggeth their souls down to hell; and thus he causeth them to catch themselves in their own snare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.27'>And thus he goeth up and down, to and fro in the earth, seeking to destroy the souls of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.28'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, wo be unto him that lieth to deceive because he supposeth that another lieth to deceive, for such are not exempt from the justice of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.29'>Now, behold, they have altered these words, because Satan saith unto them: He hath deceived you-and thus he flattereth them away to do iniquity, to get thee to tempt the Lord thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.30'>Behold, I say unto you, that you shall not translate again those words which have gone forth out of your hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.31'>For, behold, they shall not accomplish their evil designs in lying against those words. For, behold, if you should bring forth the same words they will say that you have lied and that you have pretended to translate, but that you have contradicted yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.32'>And, behold, they will publish this, and Satan will harden the hearts of the people to stir them up to anger against you, that they will not believe my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.33'>Thus Satan thinketh to overpower your testimony in this generation, that the work may not come forth in this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.34'>But behold, here is wisdom, and because I show unto you wisdom, and give you commandments concerning these things, what you shall do, show it not unto the world until you have accomplished the work of translation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.35'>Marvel not that I said unto you: Here is wisdom, show it not unto the world-for I said, show it not unto the world, that you may be preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.36'>Behold, I do not say that you shall not show it unto the righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.37'>But as you cannot always judge the righteous, or as you cannot always tell the wicked from the righteous, therefore I say unto you, hold your peace until I shall see fit to make all things known unto the world concerning the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.38'>And now, verily I say unto you, that an account of those things that you have written, which have gone out of your hands, is engraven upon the plates of Nephi;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.39'>Yea, and you remember it was said in those writings that a more particular account was given of these things upon the plates of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.40'>And now, because the account which is engraven upon the plates of Nephi is more particular concerning the things which, in my wisdom, I would bring to the knowledge of the people in this account-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.41'>Therefore, you shall translate the engravings which are on the plates of Nephi, down even till you come to the reign of king Benjamin, or until you come to that which you have translated, which you have retained;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.42'>And behold, you shall publish it as the record of Nephi; and thus I will confound those who have altered my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.43'>I will not suffer that they shall destroy my work; yea, I will show unto them that my wisdom is greater than the cunning of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.44'>Behold, they have only got a part, or an abridgment of the account of Nephi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.45'>Behold, there are many things engraven upon the plates of Nephi which do throw greater views upon my gospel; therefore, it is wisdom in me that you should translate this first part of the engravings of Nephi, and send forth in this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.46'>And, behold, all the remainder of this work does contain all those parts of my gospel which my holy prophets, yea, and also my disciples, desired in their prayers should come forth unto this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.47'>And I said unto them, that it should be granted unto them according to their faith in their prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.48'>Yea, and this was their faith-that my gospel, which I gave unto them that they might preach in their days, might come unto their brethren the Lamanites, and also all that had become Lamanites because of their dissensions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.49'>Now, this is not all-their faith in their prayers was that this gospel should be made known also, if it were possible that other nations should possess this land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.50'>And thus they did leave a blessing upon this land in their prayers, that whosoever should believe in this gospel in this land might have eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.51'>Yea, that it might be free unto all of whatsoever nation, kindred, tongue, or people they may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.52'>And now, behold, according to their faith in their prayers will I bring this part of my gospel to the knowledge of my people. Behold, I do not bring it to destroy that which they have received, but to build it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.53'>And for this cause have I said: If this generation harden not their hearts, I will establish my church among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.54'>Now I do not say this to destroy my church, but I say this to build up my church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.55'>Therefore, whosoever belongeth to my church need not fear, for such shall inherit the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.56'>But it is they who do not fear me, neither keep my commandments but build up churches unto themselves to get gain, yea, and all those that do wickedly and build up the kingdom of the devil-yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, that it is they that I will disturb, and cause to tremble and shake to the center.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.57'>Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Son of God. I came unto mine own, and mine own received me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.58'>I am the light which shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehendeth it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.59'>I am he who said-Other sheep have I which are not of this fold-unto my disciples, and many there were that understood me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.60'>And I will show unto this people that I had other sheep, and that they were a branch of the house of Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.61'>And I will bring to light their marvelous works, which they did in my name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.62'>Yea, and I will also bring to light my gospel which was ministered unto them, and, behold, they shall not deny that which you have received, but they shall build it up, and shall bring to light the true points of my doctrine, yea, and the only doctrine which is in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.63'>And this I do that I may establish my gospel, that there may not be so much contention; yea, Satan doth stir up the hearts of the people to contention concerning the points of my doctrine; and in these things they do err, for they do wrest the scriptures and do not understand them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.64'>Therefore, I will unfold unto them this great mystery;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.65'>For, behold, I will gather them as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, if they will not harden their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.66'>Yea, if they will come, they may, and partake of the waters of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.67'>Behold, this is my doctrine-whosoever repenteth and cometh unto me, the same is my church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.68'>Whosoever declareth more or less than this, the same is not of me, but is against me; therefore he is not of my church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.10.69'>And now, behold, whosoever is of my church, and endureth of my church to the end, him will I establish upon my rock, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against them.</verse>

Three of the Whitmer sons, each having received a testimony as to the genuineness of the work, became deeply concerned over the matter of their individual duty. This revelation and the two next following (Sections 15 and 16) were given in answer to an inquiry through the Urim and Thummim. David Whitmer later became one of the Three Witnesses to the Book of Mormon.] A GREAT and marvelous work is about to come forth unto the children of men.</verse>

See Ether 5: 2-4; also 2 Nephi 11: 3 and 27: 12. Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris were moved upon by an inspired desire to be the three special witnesses. The Prophet inquired of the Lord, and this revelation was given in answer, through the Urim and Thummim.] BEHOLD, I say unto you, that you must rely upon my word, which if you do with full purpose of heart, you shall have a view of the plates, and also of the breastplate, the sword of Laban, the Urim and Thummim, which were given to the brother of Jared upon the mount, when he talked with the Lord face to face, and the miraculous directors which were given to Lehi while in the wilderness, on the borders of the Red Sea.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.43.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, in February 1831. HC 1: 154-156. At this time some members of the Church were disturbed by people making false claims as revelators. The Prophet inquired of the Lord and received this communication addressed to the elders of the Church. The first part deals with matters of Church polity; the latter part contains a warning that the elders are to give to the nations of the earth.] O HEARKEN, ye elders of my church, and give ear to the words which I shall speak unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.2'>For behold, verily, verily, I say unto you, that ye have received a commandment for a law unto my church, through him whom I have appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations from my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.3'>And this ye shall know assuredly-that there is none other appointed unto you to receive commandments and revelations until he be taken, if he abide in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.4'>But verily, verily, I say unto you, that none else shall be appointed unto this gift except it be through him; for if it be taken from him he shall not have power except to appoint another in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.5'>And this shall be a law unto you, that ye receive not the teachings of any that shall come before you as revelations or commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.6'>And this I give unto you that you may not be deceived, that you may know they are not of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.7'>For verily I say unto you, that he that is ordained of me shall come in at the gate and be ordained as I have told you before, to teach those revelations which you have received and shall receive through him whom I have appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.8'>And now, behold, I give unto you a commandment, that when ye are assembled together ye shall instruct and edify each other, that ye may know how to act and direct my church, how to act upon the points of my law and commandments, which I have given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.9'>And thus ye shall become instructed in the law of my church, and be sanctified by that which ye have received, and ye shall bind yourselves to act in all holiness before me-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.10'>That inasmuch as ye do this, glory shall be added to the kingdom which ye have received. Inasmuch as ye do it not, it shall be taken, even that which ye have received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.11'>Purge ye out the iniquity which is among you; sanctify yourselves before me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.12'>And if ye desire the glories of the kingdom, appoint ye my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and uphold him before me by the prayer of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.13'>And again, I say unto you, that if ye desire the mysteries of the kingdom, provide for him food and raiment, and whatsoever thing he needeth to accomplish the work wherewith I have commanded him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.14'>And if ye do it not he shall remain unto them that have received him, that I may reserve unto myself a pure people before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.15'>Again I say, hearken ye elders of my church, whom I have appointed: Ye are not sent forth to be taught, but to teach the children of men the things which I have put into your hands by the power of my Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.16'>And ye are to be taught from on high. Sanctify yourselves and ye shall be endowed with power, that ye may give even as I have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.17'>Hearken ye, for, behold, the great day of the Lord is nigh at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.18'>For the day cometh that the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven; the heavens shall shake and the earth shall tremble, and the trump of God shall sound both long and loud, and shall say to the sleeping nations: Ye saints arise and live; ye sinners stay and sleep until I shall call again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.19'>Wherefore gird up your loins lest ye be found among the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.20'>Lift up your voices and spare not. Call upon the nations to repent, both old and young, both bond and free, saying: Prepare yourselves for the great day of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.21'>For if I, who am a man, do lift up my voice and call upon you to repent, and ye hate me, what will ye say when the day cometh when the thunders shall utter their voices from the ends of the earth, speaking to the ears of all that live, saying-Repent, and prepare for the great day of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.22'>Yea, and again, when the lightnings shall streak forth from the east unto the west, and shall utter forth their voices unto all that live, and make the ears of all tingle that hear, saying these words-Repent ye, for the great day of the Lord is come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.23'>And again, the Lord shall utter his voice out of heaven, saying: Hearken, O ye nations of the earth, and hear the words of that God who made you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.24'>O, ye nations of the earth, how often would I have gathered you together as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, but ye would not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.25'>How oft have I called upon you by the mouth of my servants, and by the ministering of angels, and by mine own voice, and by the voice of thunderings, and by the voice of lightnings, and by the voice of tempests, and by the voice of earthquakes, and great hailstorms, and by the voice of famines and pestilences of every kind, and by the great sound of a trump, and by the voice of judgment, and by the voice of mercy all the day long, and by the voice of glory and honor and the riches of eternal life, and would have saved you with an everlasting salvation, but ye would not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.26'>Behold, the day has come, when the cup of the wrath of mine indignation is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.27'>Behold, verily I say unto you, that these are the words of the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.28'>Wherefore, labor ye, labor ye in my vineyard for the last time-for the last time call upon the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.29'>For in mine own due time will I come upon the earth in judgment, and my people shall be redeemed and shall reign with me on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.30'>For the great Millennium, of which I have spoken by the mouth of my servants, shall come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.31'>For Satan shall be bound, and when he is loosed again he shall only reign for a little season, and then cometh the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.32'>And he that liveth in righteousness shall be changed in the twinkling of an eye, and the earth shall pass away so as by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.33'>And the wicked shall go away into unquenchable fire, and their end no man knoweth on earth, nor ever shall know, until they come before me in judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.34'>Hearken ye to these words. Behold, I am Jesus Christ, the Savior of the world. Treasure these things up in your hearts, and let the solemnities of eternity rest upon your minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.43.35'>Be sober. Keep all my commandments. Even so. Amen.</verse>

Prefacing his record of his revelation, the Prophet states that "at this age of the Church many false reports and foolish stories were published and circulated, to prevent people from investigating the work or embracing the faith; but to the joy of the saints . . . I received the following."] HEARKEN, O ye people of my church, to whom the kingdom has been given; hearken ye and give ear to him who laid the foundation of the earth, who made the heavens and all the hosts thereof, and by whom all things were made which live, and move, and have a being.</verse>

(Some historical sources give the date of this revelation as May 1831.) Leman Copley had embraced the gospel, but still held to some of the teachings of the Shakers (United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Appearing) to which he had formerly belonged. Some of the beliefs of the Shakers were that Christ's second coming had already occurred and he had appeared in the form of a woman, Ann Lee; baptism by water was not considered essential; the eating of pork was specifically forbidden, and many did not eat any meat; and a celibate life was considered higher than marriage. In prefacing this revelation, the Prophet wrote, "In order to have a more perfect understanding on the subject, I inquired of the Lord, and received the following." The revelation refuted some of the basic concepts of the Shaker group. The aforementioned brethren took a copy of the revelation to the Shaker community (near Cleveland, Ohio) and read it to them in its entirety, but it was rejected.] HEARKEN unto my word, my servants Sidney, and Parley, and Leman; for behold, verily I say unto you, that I give unto you a commandment that you shall go and preach my gospel which ye have received, even as ye have received it, unto the Shakers.</verse>

The Prophet, Sidney Rigdon, and Oliver Cowdery had arrived in Kirtland on August 27, from their visit to Missouri. Prefacing his record of this revelation the Prophet wrote: "In these infant days of the Church, there was a great anxiety to obtain the word of the Lord upon every subject that in any way concerned our salvation; and as the land of Zion was now the most important temporal object in view, I inquired of the Lord for further information upon the gathering of the Saints, and the purchase of the land, and other matters."] HEARKEN, O ye people, and open your hearts and give ear from afar; and listen, you that call yourselves the people of the Lord, and hear the word of the Lord and his will concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.63.2'>Yea, verily, I say, hear the word of him whose anger is kindled against the wicked and rebellious;</verse>

In prefacing this revelation, the Prophet wrote: "At the request of William E. McLellin, I inquired of the Lord, and received the following."] BEHOLD, thus saith the Lord unto my servant William E. McLellin-Blessed are you, inasmuch as you have turned away from your iniquities, and have received my truths, saith the Lord your Redeemer, the Savior of the world, even of as many as believe on my name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.67.1'>[Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, November 1831. HC 1: 224-225. The occasion was that of a special conference, and the publication of the revelations already received from the Lord through the Prophet was considered and acted upon. See heading to Section 1. It was decided that Oliver Cowdery and John Whitmer should take the manuscripts of the revelations to Independence, where W. W. Phelps would publish them as the "Book of Commandments." Many of the brethren bore solemn testimony that the revelations then compiled for publication were verily true, as was witnessed by the Holy Ghost shed forth upon them. The Prophet records that after the revelation known as Section 1 had been received, some negative conversation was had concerning the language used in the revelations. The present revelation followed.] BEHOLD and hearken, O ye elders of my church, who have assembled yourselves together, whose prayers I have heard, and whose hearts I know, and whose desires have come up before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.67.2'>Behold and lo, mine eyes are upon you, and the heavens and the earth are in mine hands, and the riches of eternity are mine to give.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.67.8'>But if ye cannot make one like unto it, ye are under condemnation if ye do not bear record that they are true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.67.9'>For ye know that there is no unrighteousness in them, and that which is righteous cometh down from above, from the Father of lights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.67.10'>And again, verily I say unto you that it is your privilege, and a promise I give unto you that have been ordained unto this ministry, that inasmuch as you strip yourselves from jealousies and fears, and humble yourselves before me, for ye are not sufficiently humble, the veil shall be rent and you shall see me and know that I am-not with the carnal neither natural mind, but with the spiritual.</verse>

The compilation of revelations intended for early publication had been passed upon at the special conference of November 1. On November 3, the revelation herein appearing as Section 133 was added, and called the Appendix. By action of the conference, Oliver Cowdery was appointed to carry the manuscript of the compiled revelations and commandments to Independence, Missouri, for printing. He was also to take with him moneys that had been contributed for the building up of the Church in Missouri. As the course of travel would lead him through a sparsely settled country to the frontier, a traveling companion was desirable.] HEARKEN unto me, saith the Lord your God, for my servant Oliver Cowdery's sake.

Prefacing his record of this vision the Prophet wrote: "Upon my return from Amherst conference, I resumed the translation of the Scriptures. From sundry revelations which had been received, it was apparent that many important points touching the salvation of man had been taken from the Bible, or lost before it was compiled. It appeared self-evident from what truths were left, that if God rewarded every one according to the deeds done in the body, the term 'Heaven,' as intended for the Saints' eternal home, must include more kingdoms than one. Accordingly, while translating St. John's Gospel, myself and Elder Rigdon saw the following vision." It was after the Prophet had translated John 5: 29 that this vision was given.] HEAR, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, and rejoice ye inhabitants thereof, for the Lord is God, and beside him there is no Savior.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.77.1'>[Revelation given to Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Hiram, Ohio, March 1832. HC 1: 253-255. The Prophet wrote, "In connection with the translation of the Scriptures, I received the following explanation of the Revelation of St. John."] Q. What is the sea of glass spoken of by John, 4th chapter, and 6th verse of the Revelation? A. It is the earth, in its sanctified, immortal, and eternal state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.2'>Q. What are we to understand by the four beasts, spoken of in the same verse? A. They are figurative expressions, used by the Revelator, John, in describing heaven, the paradise of God, the happiness of man, and of beasts, and of creeping things, and of the fowls of the air; that which is spiritual being in the likeness of that which is temporal; and that which is temporal in the likeness of that which is spiritual; the spirit of man in the likeness of his person, as also the spirit of the beast, and every other creature which God has created.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.3'>Q. Are the four beasts limited to individual beasts, or do they represent classes or orders? A. They are limited to four individual beasts, which were shown to John, to represent the glory of the classes of beings in their destined order or sphere of creation, in the enjoyment of their eternal felicity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.4'>Q. What are we to understand by the eyes and wings, which the beasts had? A. Their eyes are a representation of light and knowledge, that is, they are full of knowledge; and their wings are a representation of power, to move, to act, etc.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.5'>Q. What are we to understand by the four and twenty elders, spoken of by John? A. We are to understand that these elders whom John saw, were elders who had been faithful in the work of the ministry and were dead; who belonged to the seven churches, and were then in the paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.6'>Q. What are we to understand by the book which John saw, which was sealed on the back with seven seals? A. We are to understand that it contains the revealed will, mysteries, and the works of God; the hidden things of his economy concerning this earth during the seven thousand years of its continuance, or its temporal existence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.7'>Q. What are we to understand by the seven seals with which it was sealed? A. We are to understand that the first seal contains the things of the first thousand years, and the second also of the second thousand years, and so on until the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.8'>Q. What are we to understand by the four angels, spoken of in the 7th chapter and 1st verse of Revelation? A. We are to understand that they are four angels sent forth from God, to whom is given power over the four parts of the earth, to save life and to destroy; these are they who have the everlasting gospel to commit to every nation, kindred, tongue, and people; having power to shut up the heavens, to seal up unto life, or to cast down to the regions of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.9'>Q. What are we to understand by the angel ascending from the east, Revelation 7th chapter and 2nd verse? A. We are to understand that the angel ascending from the east is he to whom is given the seal of the living God over the twelve tribes of Israel; wherefore, he crieth unto the four angels having the everlasting gospel, saying: Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, till we have sealed the servants of our God in their foreheads. And, if you will receive it, this is Elias which was to come to gather together the tribes of Israel and restore all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.10'>Q. What time are the things spoken of in this chapter to be accomplished? A. They are to be accomplished in the sixth thousand years, or the opening of the sixth seal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.11'>Q. What are we to understand by sealing the one hundred and forty-four thousand, out of all the tribes of Israel-twelve thousand out of every tribe? A. We are to understand that those who are sealed are high priests, ordained unto the holy order of God, to administer the everlasting gospel; for they are they who are ordained out of every nation, kindred, tongue, and people, by the angels to whom is given power over the nations of the earth, to bring as many as will come to the church of the Firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.12'>Q. What are we to understand by the sounding of the trumpets, mentioned in the 8th chapter of Revelation? A. We are to understand that as God made the world in six days, and on the seventh day he finished his work, and sanctified it, and also formed man out of the dust of the earth, even so, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years will the Lord God sanctify the earth, and complete the salvation of man, and judge all things, and shall redeem all things, except that which he hath not put into his power, when he shall have sealed all things, unto the end of all things; and the sounding of the trumpets of the seven angels are the preparing and finishing of his work, in the beginning of the seventh thousand years-the preparing of the way before the time of his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.13'>Q. When are the things to be accomplished, which are written in the 9th chapter of Revelation? A. They are to be accomplished after the opening of the seventh seal, before the coming of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.14'>Q. What are we to understand by the little book which was eaten by John, as mentioned in the 10th chapter of Revelation? A. We are to understand that it was a mission, and an ordinance, for him to gather the tribes of Israel; behold, this is Elias, who, as it is written, must come and restore all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.77.15'>Q. What is to be understood by the two witnesses, in the eleventh chapter of Revelation? A. They are two prophets that are to be raised up to the Jewish nation in the last days, at the time of the restoration, and to prophesy to the Jews after they are gathered and have built the city of Jerusalem in the land of their fathers.</verse>

The historical records show that when this revelation was received in March 1832, it called Jesse Gause to the office of counselor to Joseph Smith in the Presidency. However, when he failed to continue in a manner consistent with this appointment, the call was subsequently transferred to Frederick G. Williams. The revelation (dated March 1832) should be regarded as a step toward the formal organization of the First Presidency, specifically calling for the office of counselor in that body and explaining the dignity of the appointment. Brother Gause served for a time, but was excommunicated from the Church in December 1832. Brother Williams was ordained to the specified office on March 18, 1833.] VERILY, verily, I say unto you my servant Frederick G.

        <verse osisID='Neh.82.17'>And you are to be equal, or in other words, you are to have equal claims on the properties, for the benefit of managing the concerns of your stewardships, every man according to his wants and his needs, inasmuch as his wants are just-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.82.18'>And all this for the benefit of the church of the living God, that every man may improve upon his talent, that every man may gain other talents, yea, even an hundred fold, to be cast into the Lord's storehouse, to become the common property of the whole church-</verse>

During the month of September, elders had begun to return from their missions in the eastern states and to make reports of their labors. It was while they were together in this season of joy that the following communication was received. The Prophet designates it a revelation on priesthood.] A REVELATION of Jesus Christ unto his servant Joseph Smith, Jun., and six elders, as they united their hearts and lifted their voices on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.2'>Yea, the word of the Lord concerning his church, established in the last days for the restoration of his people, as he has spoken by the mouth of his prophets, and for the gathering of his saints to stand upon Mount Zion, which shall be the city of New Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.3'>Which city shall be built, beginning at the temple lot, which is appointed by the finger of the Lord, in the western boundaries of the State of Missouri, and dedicated by the hand of Joseph Smith, Jun., and others with whom the Lord was well pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.4'>Verily this is the word of the Lord, that the city New Jerusalem shall be built by the gathering of the saints, beginning at this place, even the place of the temple, which temple shall be reared in this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.5'>For verily this generation shall not all pass away until an house shall be built unto the Lord, and a cloud shall rest upon it, which cloud shall be even the glory of the Lord, which shall fill the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.6'>And the sons of Moses, according to the Holy Priesthood which he received under the hand of his father-in-law, Jethro;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.7'>And Jethro received it under the hand of Caleb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.8'>And Caleb received it under the hand of Elihu;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.13'>Esaias also lived in the days of Abraham, and was blessed of him-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.14'>Which Abraham received the priesthood from Melchizedek, who received it through the lineage of his fathers, even till Noah;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.18'>And the Lord confirmed a priesthood also upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations, which priesthood also continueth and abideth forever with the priesthood which is after the holiest order of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.19'>And this greater priesthood administereth the gospel and holdeth the key of the mysteries of the kingdom, even the key of the knowledge of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.23'>Now this Moses plainly taught to the children of Israel in the wilderness, and sought diligently to sanctify his people that they might behold the face of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.24'>But they hardened their hearts and could not endure his presence; therefore, the Lord in his wrath, for his anger was kindled against them, swore that they should not enter into his rest while in the wilderness, which rest is the fulness of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.25'>Therefore, he took Moses out of their midst, and the Holy Priesthood also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.26'>And the lesser priesthood continued, which priesthood holdeth the key of the ministering of angels and the preparatory gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.27'>Which gospel is the gospel of repentance and of baptism, and the remission of sins, and the law of carnal commandments, which the Lord in his wrath caused to continue with the house of Aaron among the children of Israel until John, whom God raised up, being filled with the Holy Ghost from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.28'>For he was baptized while he was yet in his childhood, and was ordained by the angel of God at the time he was eight days old unto this power, to overthrow the kingdom of the Jews, and to make straight the way of the Lord before the face of his people, to prepare them for the coming of the Lord, in whose hand is given all power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.29'>And again, the offices of elder and bishop are necessary appendages belonging unto the high priesthood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.31'>Therefore, as I said concerning the sons of Moses-for the sons of Moses and also the sons of Aaron shall offer an acceptable offering and sacrifice in the house of the Lord, which house shall be built unto the Lord in this generation, upon the consecrated spot as I have appointed-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.32'>And the sons of Moses and of Aaron shall be filled with the glory of the Lord, upon Mount Zion in the Lord's house, whose sons are ye; and also many whom I have called and sent forth to build up my church.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.35'>And also all they who receive this priesthood receive me, saith the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.36'>For he that receiveth my servants receiveth me;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.45'>For the word of the Lord is truth, and whatsoever is truth is light, and whatsoever is light is Spirit, even the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.48'>And the Father teacheth him of the covenant which he has renewed and confirmed upon you, which is confirmed upon you for your sakes, and not for your sakes only, but for the sake of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.49'>And the whole world lieth in sin, and groaneth under darkness and under the bondage of sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.51'>For whoso cometh not unto me is under the bondage of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.52'>And whoso receiveth not my voice is not acquainted with my voice, and is not of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.53'>And by this you may know the righteous from the wicked, and that the whole world groaneth under sin and darkness even now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.54'>And your minds in times past have been darkened because of unbelief, and because you have treated lightly the things you have received-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.56'>And this condemnation resteth upon the children of Zion, even all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.57'>And they shall remain under this condemnation until they repent and remember the new covenant, even the Book of Mormon and the former commandments which I have given them, not only to say, but to do according to that which I have written-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.75'>And this revelation unto you, and commandment, is in force from this very hour upon all the world, and the gospel is unto all who have not received it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.76'>But, verily I say unto all those to whom the kingdom has been given-from you it must be preached unto them, that they shall repent of their former evil works; for they are to be upbraided for their evil hearts of unbelief, and your brethren in Zion for their rebellion against you at the time I sent you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.77'>And again I say unto you, my friends, for from henceforth I shall call you friends, it is expedient that I give unto you this commandment, that ye become even as my friends in days when I was with them, traveling to preach the gospel in my power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.84.78'>For I suffered them not to have purse or scrip, neither two coats.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.84.80'>And any man that shall go and preach this gospel of the kingdom, and fail not to continue faithful in all things, shall not be weary in mind, neither darkened, neither in body, limb, nor joint; and a hair of his head shall not fall to the ground unnoticed.

W. Phelps, who was living in Independence, Missouri. It was given to answer questions about those saints who had moved to Zion, but who had not received their inheritances according to the established order in the Church.] IT is the duty of the Lord's clerk, whom he has appointed, to keep a history, and a general church record of all things that transpire in Zion, and of all those who consecrate properties, and receive inheritances legally from the bishop;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.85.2'>And also their manner of life, their faith, and works; and also of the apostates who apostatize after receiving their inheritances.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.86.4'>But behold, in the last days, even now while the Lord is beginning to bring forth the word, and the blade is springing up and is yet tender-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.86.8'>Therefore, thus saith the Lord unto you, with whom the priesthood hath continued through the lineage of your fathers-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.86.9'>For ye are lawful heirs, according to the flesh, and have been hid from the world with Christ in God-</verse>

HC 1: 343-346.] VERILY, thus saith the Lord: It shall come to pass that every soul who forsaketh his sins and cometh unto me, and calleth on my name, and obeyeth my voice, and keepeth my commandments, shall see my face and know that I am;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.2'>And that I am the true light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.3'>And that I am in the Father, and the Father in me, and the Father and I are one-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.4'>The Father because he gave me of his fulness, and the Son because I was in the world and made flesh my tabernacle, and dwelt among the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.5'>I was in the world and received of my Father, and the works of him were plainly manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.6'>And John saw and bore record of the fulness of my glory, and the fulness of John's record is hereafter to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.7'>And he bore record, saying: I saw his glory, that he was in the beginning, before the world was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.8'>Therefore, in the beginning the Word was, for he was the Word, even the messenger of salvation-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.9'>The light and the Redeemer of the world; the Spirit of truth, who came into the world, because the world was made by him, and in him was the life of men and the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.10'>The worlds were made by him; men were made by him; all things were made by him, and through him, and of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.11'>And I, John, bear record that I beheld his glory, as the glory of the Only Begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, even the Spirit of truth, which came and dwelt in the flesh, and dwelt among us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.12'>And I, John, saw that he received not of the fulness at the first, but received grace for grace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.13'>And he received not of the fulness at first, but continued from grace to grace, until he received a fulness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.14'>And thus he was called the Son of God, because he received not of the fulness at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.15'>And I, John, bear record, and lo, the heavens were opened, and the Holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove, and sat upon him, and there came a voice out of heaven saying: This is my beloved Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.16'>And I, John, bear record that he received a fulness of the glory of the Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.17'>And he received all power, both in heaven and on earth, and the glory of the Father was with him, for he dwelt in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.18'>And it shall come to pass, that if you are faithful you shall receive the fulness of the record of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.19'>I give unto you these sayings that you may understand and know how to worship, and know what you worship, that you may come unto the Father in my name, and in due time receive of his fulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.20'>For if you keep my commandments you shall receive of his fulness, and be glorified in me as I am in the Father; therefore, I say unto you, you shall receive grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.21'>And now, verily I say unto you, I was in the beginning with the Father, and am the Firstborn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.22'>And all those who are begotten through me are partakers of the glory of the same, and are the church of the Firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.23'>Ye were also in the beginning with the Father; that which is Spirit, even the Spirit of truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.24'>And truth is knowledge of things as they are, and as they were, and as they are to come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.25'>And whatsoever is more or less than this is the spirit of that wicked one who was a liar from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.26'>The Spirit of truth is of God. I am the Spirit of truth, and John bore record of me, saying: He received a fulness of truth, yea, even of all truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.27'>And no man receiveth a fulness unless he keepeth his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.28'>He that keepeth his commandments receiveth truth and light, until he is glorified in truth and knoweth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.29'>Man was also in the beginning with God. Intelligence, or the light of truth, was not created or made, neither indeed can be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.30'>All truth is independent in that sphere in which God has placed it, to act for itself, as all intelligence also; otherwise there is no existence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.31'>Behold, here is the agency of man, and here is the condemnation of man; because that which was from the beginning is plainly manifest unto them, and they receive not the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.32'>And every man whose spirit receiveth not the light is under condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.33'>For man is spirit. The elements are eternal, and spirit and element, inseparably connected, receive a fulness of joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.34'>And when separated, man cannot receive a fulness of joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.35'>The elements are the tabernacle of God; yea, man is the tabernacle of God, even temples; and whatsoever temple is defiled, God shall destroy that temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.36'>The glory of God is intelligence, or, in other words, light and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.37'>Light and truth forsake that evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.38'>Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.39'>And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men, and because of the tradition of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.40'>But I have commanded you to bring up your children in light and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.41'>But verily I say unto you, my servant Frederick G. Williams, you have continued under this condemnation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.42'>You have not taught your children light and truth, according to the commandments; and that wicked one hath power, as yet, over you, and this is the cause of your affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.43'>And now a commandment I give unto you-if you will be delivered you shall set in order your own house, for there are many things that are not right in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.44'>Verily, I say unto my servant Sidney Rigdon, that in some things he hath not kept the commandments concerning his children; therefore, first set in order thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.45'>Verily, I say unto my servant Joseph Smith, Jun., or in other words, I will call you friends, for you are my friends, and ye shall have an inheritance with me-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.46'>I called you servants for the world's sake, and ye are their servants for my sake-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.47'>And now, verily I say unto Joseph Smith, Jun.-You have not kept the commandments, and must needs stand rebuked before the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.48'>Your family must needs repent and forsake some things, and give more earnest heed unto your sayings, or be removed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.49'>What I say unto one I say unto all; pray always lest that wicked one have power in you, and remove you out of your place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.50'>My servant Newel K. Whitney also, a bishop of my church, hath need to be chastened, and set in order his family, and see that they are more diligent and concerned at home, and pray always, or they shall be removed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.51'>Now, I say unto you, my friends, let my servant Sidney Rigdon go on his journey, and make haste, and also proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord, and the gospel of salvation, as I shall give him utterance; and by your prayer of faith with one consent I will uphold him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.52'>And let my servants Joseph Smith, Jun., and Frederick G. Williams make haste also, and it shall be given them even according to the prayer of faith; and inasmuch as you keep my sayings you shall not be confounded in this world, nor in the world to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.93.53'>And, verily I say unto you, that it is my will that you should hasten to translate my scriptures, and to obtain a knowledge of history, and of countries, and of kingdoms, of laws of God and man, and all this for the salvation of Zion. Amen.</verse>

This revelation is a continuation of divine directions to build houses for worship and instruction, especially the House of the Lord. See Section 88: 119-136 and Section 94.] VERILY, thus saith the Lord unto you whom I love, and whom I love I also chasten that their sins may be forgiven, for with the chastisement I prepare a way for their deliverance in all things out of temptation, and I have loved you-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.95.2'>Wherefore, ye must needs be chastened and stand rebuked before my face;</verse>

The occasion was a conference of high priests, and the chief subject of consideration was the disposal of certain lands, known as the French farm, possessed by the Church near Kirtland. Since the conference could not agree who should take charge of the farm, all agreed to inquire of the Lord concerning the matter.] BEHOLD, I say unto you, here is wisdom, whereby ye may know how to act concerning this matter, for it is expedient in me that this stake that I have set for the strength of Zion should be made strong.</verse>

Members of the Church in Missouri were at this time subjected to severe persecution, and on July 23, 1833, had been forced to sign an agreement to leave Jackson County.] VERILY I say unto you my friends, I speak unto you with my voice, even the voice of my Spirit, that I may show unto you my will concerning your brethren in the land of Zion, many of whom are truly humble and are seeking diligently to learn wisdom and to find truth.</verse>

It is natural that the saints in Missouri, having suffered physically and also having lost property, should feel an inclination toward retaliation and revenge. Therefore the Lord gave this revelation. Although some news of the problems in Missouri had no doubt reached the Prophet in Kirtland (nine hundred miles away), the seriousness of the situation could have been known to him at this date only by revelation.] VERILY I say unto you my friends, fear not, let your hearts be comforted; yea, rejoice evermore, and in everything give thanks;</verse>

The original minutes were recorded by Elders Oliver Cowdery and Orson Hyde. Two days later, the minutes were corrected by the Prophet, read to the high council, and accepted by the council. Verses 30-32, having to do with the Council of the Twelve Apostles, were added by the Prophet Joseph Smith in 1835 when he prepared this section for publication in the Doctrine and Covenants.] THIS day a general council of twenty-four high priests assembled at the house of Joseph Smith, Jun., by revelation, and proceeded to organize the high council of the church of Christ, which was to consist of twelve high priests, and one or three presidents as the case might require.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.2'>The high council was appointed by revelation for the purpose of settling important difficulties which might arise in the church, which could not be settled by the church or the bishop's council to the satisfaction of the parties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.3'>Joseph Smith, Jun., Sidney Rigdon and Frederick G. Williams were acknowledged presidents by the voice of the council; and Joseph Smith, Sen., John Smith, Joseph Coe, John Johnson, Martin Harris, John S. Carter, Jared Carter, Oliver Cowdery, Samuel H. Smith, Orson Hyde, Sylvester Smith, and Luke Johnson, high priests, were chosen to be a standing council for the church, by the unanimous voice of the council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.4'>The above-named councilors were then asked whether they accepted their appointments, and whether they would act in that office according to the law of heaven, to which they all answered that they accepted their appointments, and would fill their offices according to the grace of God bestowed upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.5'>The number composing the council, who voted in the name and for the church in appointing the above-named councilors were forty-three, as follows: nine high priests, seventeen elders, four priests, and thirteen members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.6'>Voted: that the high council cannot have power to act without seven of the above-named councilors, or their regularly appointed successors are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.7'>These seven shall have power to appoint other high priests, whom they may consider worthy and capable to act in the place of absent councilors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.8'>Voted: that whenever any vacancy shall occur by the death, removal from office for transgression, or removal from the bounds of this church government, of any one of the above-named councilors, it shall be filled by the nomination of the president or presidents, and sanctioned by the voice of a general council of high priests, convened for that purpose, to act in the name of the church.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.102.12'>Whenever a high council of the church of Christ is regularly organized, according to the foregoing pattern, it shall be the duty of the twelve councilors to cast lots by numbers, and thereby ascertain who of the twelve shall speak first, commencing with number one and so in succession to number twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.13'>Whenever this council convenes to act upon any case, the twelve councilors shall consider whether it is a difficult one or not; if it is not, two only of the councilors shall speak upon it, according to the form above written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.14'>But if it is thought to be difficult, four shall be appointed; and if more difficult, six; but in no case shall more than six be appointed to speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.102.28'>This council of high priests abroad is only to be called on the most difficult cases of church matters; and no common or ordinary case is to be sufficient to call such council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.29'>The traveling or located high priests abroad have power to say whether it is necessary to call such a council or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.102.30'>There is a distinction between the high council or traveling high priests abroad, and the traveling high council composed of the twelve apostles, in their decisions.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.107'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.1'>[Revelation on priesthood, given through Joseph Smith the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio, dated March 28, 1835. HC 2: 209-217. On the date named the Twelve met in council, confessing their individual weaknesses and shortcomings, expressing repentance, and seeking the further guidance of the Lord. They were about to separate on missions to districts assigned. Although portions of this section were received on the date named, the historical records affirm that various parts were received at sundry times, some as early as November 1831.] THERE are, in the church, two priesthoods, namely, the Melchizedek and Aaronic, including the Levitical Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.2'>Why the first is called the Melchizedek Priesthood is because Melchizedek was such a great high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.3'>Before his day it was called the Holy Priesthood, after the Order of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.4'>But out of respect or reverence to the name of the Supreme Being, to avoid the too frequent repetition of his name, they, the church, in ancient days, called that priesthood after Melchizedek, or the Melchizedek Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.5'>All other authorities or offices in the church are appendages to this priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.6'>But there are two divisions or grand heads-one is the Melchizedek Priesthood, and the other is the Aaronic or Levitical Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.7'>The office of an elder comes under the priesthood of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.8'>The Melchizedek Priesthood holds the right of presidency, and has power and authority over all the offices in the church in all ages of the world, to administer in spiritual things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.9'>The Presidency of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchizedek, have a right to officiate in all the offices in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.10'>High priests after the order of the Melchizedek Priesthood have a right to officiate in their own standing, under the direction of the presidency, in administering spiritual things, and also in the office of an elder, priest (of the Levitical order), teacher, deacon, and member.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.11'>An elder has a right to officiate in his stead when the high priest is not present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.12'>The high priest and elder are to administer in spiritual things, agreeable to the covenants and commandments of the church; and they have a right to officiate in all these offices of the church when there are no higher authorities present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.13'>The second priesthood is called the Priesthood of Aaron, because it was conferred upon Aaron and his seed, throughout all their generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.14'>Why it is called the lesser priesthood is because it is an appendage to the greater, or the Melchizedek Priesthood, and has power in administering outward ordinances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.15'>The bishopric is the presidency of this priesthood, and holds the keys or authority of the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.16'>No man has a legal right to this office, to hold the keys of this priesthood, except he be a literal descendant of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.17'>But as a high priest of the Melchizedek Priesthood has authority to officiate in all the lesser offices, he may officiate in the office of bishop when no literal descendant of Aaron can be found, provided he is called and set apart and ordained unto this power by the hands of the Presidency of the Melchizedek Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.18'>The power and authority of the higher, or Melchizedek Priesthood, is to hold the keys of all the spiritual blessings of the church-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.19'>To have the privilege of receiving the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, to have the heavens opened unto them, to commune with the general assembly and church of the Firstborn, and to enjoy the communion and presence of God the Father, and Jesus the mediator of the new covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.20'>The power and authority of the lesser, or Aaronic Priesthood, is to hold the keys of the ministering of angels, and to administer in outward ordinances, the letter of the gospel, the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins, agreeable to the covenants and commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.21'>Of necessity there are presidents, or presiding officers growing out of, or appointed of or from among those who are ordained to the several offices in these two priesthoods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.22'>Of the Melchizedek Priesthood, three Presiding High Priests, chosen by the body, appointed and ordained to that office, and upheld by the confidence, faith, and prayer of the church, form a quorum of the Presidency of the Church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.23'>The twelve traveling councilors are called to be the Twelve Apostles, or special witnesses of the name of Christ in all the world-thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.24'>And they form a quorum, equal in authority and power to the three presidents previously mentioned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.25'>The Seventy are also called to preach the gospel, and to be especial witnesses unto the Gentiles and in all the world-thus differing from other officers in the church in the duties of their calling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.26'>And they form a quorum, equal in authority to that of the Twelve special witnesses or Apostles just named.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.27'>And every decision made by either of these quorums must be by the unanimous voice of the same; that is, every member in each quorum must be agreed to its decisions, in order to make their decisions of the same power or validity one with the other-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.28'>A majority may form a quorum when circumstances render it impossible to be otherwise-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.29'>Unless this is the case, their decisions are not entitled to the same blessings which the decisions of a quorum of three presidents were anciently, who were ordained after the order of Melchizedek, and were righteous and holy men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.30'>The decisions of these quorums, or either of them, are to be made in all righteousness, in holiness, and lowliness of heart, meekness and long suffering, and in faith, and virtue, and knowledge, temperance, patience, godliness, brotherly kindness and charity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.31'>Because the promise is, if these things abound in them they shall not be unfruitful in the knowledge of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.32'>And in case that any decision of these quorums is made in unrighteousness, it may be brought before a general assembly of the several quorums, which constitute the spiritual authorities of the church; otherwise there can be no appeal from their decision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.33'>The Twelve are a Traveling Presiding High Council, to officiate in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Presidency of the Church, agreeable to the institution of heaven; to build up the church, and regulate all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and secondly unto the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.34'>The Seventy are to act in the name of the Lord, under the direction of the Twelve or the traveling high council, in building up the church and regulating all the affairs of the same in all nations, first unto the Gentiles and then to the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.35'>The Twelve being sent out, holding the keys, to open the door by the proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and first unto the Gentiles and then unto the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.36'>The standing high councils, at the stakes of Zion, form a quorum equal in authority in the affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the quorum of the presidency, or to the traveling high council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.37'>The high council in Zion form a quorum equal in authority in the affairs of the church, in all their decisions, to the councils of the Twelve at the stakes of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.38'>It is the duty of the traveling high council to call upon the Seventy, when they need assistance, to fill the several calls for preaching and administering the gospel, instead of any others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.39'>It is the duty of the Twelve, in all large branches of the church, to ordain evangelical ministers, as they shall be designated unto them by revelation-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.40'>The order of this priesthood was confirmed to be handed down from father to son, and rightly belongs to the literal descendants of the chosen seed, to whom the promises were made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.41'>This order was instituted in the days of Adam, and came down by lineage in the following manner:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.42'>From Adam to Seth, who was ordained by Adam at the age of sixty-nine years, and was blessed by him three years previous to his (Adam's) death, and received the promise of God by his father, that his posterity should be the chosen of the Lord, and that they should be preserved unto the end of the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.43'>Because he (Seth) was a perfect man, and his likeness was the express likeness of his father, insomuch that he seemed to be like unto his father in all things, and could be distinguished from him only by his age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.44'>Enos was ordained at the age of one hundred and thirty-four years and four months, by the hand of Adam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.45'>God called upon Cainan in the wilderness in the fortieth year of his age; and he met Adam in journeying to the place Shedolamak. He was eighty-seven years old when he received his ordination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.46'>Mahalaleel was four hundred and ninety-six years and seven days old when he was ordained by the hand of Adam, who also blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.47'>Jared was two hundred years old when he was ordained under the hand of Adam, who also blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.48'>Enoch was twenty-five years old when he was ordained under the hand of Adam; and he was sixty-five and Adam blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.49'>And he saw the Lord, and he walked with him, and was before his face continually; and he walked with God three hundred and sixty-five years, making him four hundred and thirty years old when he was translated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.50'>Methuselah was one hundred years old when he was ordained under the hand of Adam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.51'>Lamech was thirty-two years old when he was ordained under the hand of Seth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.52'>Noah was ten years old when he was ordained under the hand of Methuselah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.53'>Three years previous to the death of Adam, he called Seth, Enos, Cainan, Mahalaleel, Jared, Enoch, and Methuselah, who were all high priests, with the residue of his posterity who were righteous, into the valley of Adam-ondi-Ahman, and there bestowed upon them his last blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.54'>And the Lord appeared unto them, and they rose up and blessed Adam, and called him Michael, the prince, the archangel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.55'>And the Lord administered comfort unto Adam, and said unto him: I have set thee to be at the head; a multitude of nations shall come of thee, and thou art a prince over them forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.56'>And Adam stood up in the midst of the congregation; and, notwithstanding he was bowed down with age, being full of the Holy Ghost, predicted whatsoever should befall his posterity unto the latest generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.57'>These things were all written in the book of Enoch, and are to be testified of in due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.58'>It is the duty of the Twelve, also, to ordain and set in order all the other officers of the church, agreeable to the revelation which says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.59'>To the church of Christ in the land of Zion, in addition to the church laws respecting church business-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.60'>Verily, I say unto you, saith the Lord of Hosts, there must needs be presiding elders to preside over those who are of the office of an elder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.61'>And also priests to preside over those who are of the office of a priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.62'>And also teachers to preside over those who are of the office of a teacher, in like manner, and also the deacons-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.63'>Wherefore, from deacon to teacher, and from teacher to priest, and from priest to elder, severally as they are appointed, according to the covenants and commandments of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.64'>Then comes the High Priesthood, which is the greatest of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.65'>Wherefore, it must needs be that one be appointed of the High Priesthood to preside over the priesthood, and he shall be called President of the High Priesthood of the Church;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.66'>Or, in other words, the Presiding High Priest over the High Priesthood of the Church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.67'>From the same comes the administering of ordinances and blessings upon the church, by the laying on of the hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.68'>Wherefore, the office of a bishop is not equal unto it; for the office of a bishop is in administering all temporal things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.69'>Nevertheless a bishop must be chosen from the High Priesthood, unless he is a literal descendant of Aaron;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.70'>For unless he is a literal descendant of Aaron he cannot hold the keys of that priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.71'>Nevertheless, a high priest, that is, after the order of Melchizedek, may be set apart unto the ministering of temporal things, having a knowledge of them by the Spirit of truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.72'>And also to be a judge in Israel, to do the business of the church, to sit in judgment upon transgressors upon testimony as it shall be laid before him according to the laws, by the assistance of his counselors, whom he has chosen or will choose among the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.73'>This is the duty of a bishop who is not a literal descendant of Aaron, but has been ordained to the High Priesthood after the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.74'>Thus shall he be a judge, even a common judge among the inhabitants of Zion, or in a stake of Zion, or in any branch of the church where he shall be set apart unto this ministry, until the borders of Zion are enlarged and it becomes necessary to have other bishops or judges in Zion or elsewhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.75'>And inasmuch as there are other bishops appointed they shall act in the same office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.76'>But a literal descendant of Aaron has a legal right to the presidency of this priesthood, to the keys of this ministry, to act in the office of bishop independently, without counselors, except in a case where a President of the High Priesthood, after the order of Melchizedek, is tried, to sit as a judge in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.77'>And the decision of either of these councils, agreeable to the commandment which says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.78'>Again, verily, I say unto you, the most important business of the church, and the most difficult cases of the church, inasmuch as there is not satisfaction upon the decision of the bishop or judges, it shall be handed over and carried up unto the council of the church, before the Presidency of the High Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.79'>And the Presidency of the council of the High Priesthood shall have power to call other high priests, even twelve, to assist as counselors; and thus the Presidency of the High Priesthood and its counselors shall have power to decide upon testimony according to the laws of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.80'>And after this decision it shall be had in remembrance no more before the Lord; for this is the highest council of the church of God, and a final decision upon controversies in spiritual matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.81'>There is not any person belonging to the church who is exempt from this council of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.82'>And inasmuch as a President of the High Priesthood shall transgress, he shall be had in remembrance before the common council of the church, who shall be assisted by twelve counselors of the High Priesthood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.83'>And their decision upon his head shall be an end of controversy concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.84'>Thus, none shall be exempted from the justice and the laws of God, that all things may be done in order and in solemnity before him, according to truth and righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.85'>And again, verily I say unto you, the duty of a president over the office of a deacon is to preside over twelve deacons, to sit in council with them, and to teach them their duty, edifying one another, as it is given according to the covenants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.86'>And also the duty of the president over the office of the teachers is to preside over twenty-four of the teachers, and to sit in council with them, teaching them the duties of their office, as given in the covenants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.87'>Also the duty of the president over the Priesthood of Aaron is to preside over forty-eight priests, and sit in council with them, to teach them the duties of their office, as is given in the covenants-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.88'>This president is to be a bishop; for this is one of the duties of this priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.89'>Again, the duty of the president over the office of elders is to preside over ninety-six elders, and to sit in council with them, and to teach them according to the covenants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.90'>This presidency is a distinct one from that of the seventy, and is designed for those who do not travel into all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.91'>And again, the duty of the President of the office of the High Priesthood is to preside over the whole church, and to be like unto Moses-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.92'>Behold, here is wisdom; yea, to be a seer, a revelator, a translator, and a prophet, having all the gifts of God which he bestows upon the head of the church.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.107.98'>Whereas other officers of the church, who belong not unto the Twelve, neither to the Seventy, are not under the responsibility to travel among all nations, but are to travel as their circumstances shall allow, notwithstanding they may hold as high and responsible offices in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.99'>Wherefore, now let every man learn his duty, and to act in the office in which he is appointed, in all diligence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.107.100'>He that is slothful shall not be counted worthy to stand, and he that learns not his duty and shows himself not approved shall not be counted worthy to stand. Even so. Amen.</verse>

Because of failure on the part of many to abide by this covenant, the Lord withdrew it for a time, and gave instead the law of tithing to the whole Church.

HC 5: 142-144.] FORASMUCH as the Lord has revealed unto me that my enemies, both in Missouri and this State, were again in the pursuit of me; and inasmuch as they pursue me without a cause, and have not the least shadow or coloring of justice or right on their side in the getting up of their prosecutions against me; and inasmuch as their pretensions are all founded in falsehood of the blackest dye, I have thought it expedient and wisdom in me to leave the place for a short season, for my own safety and the safety of this people. I would say to all those with whom I have business, that I have left my affairs with agents and clerks who will transact all business in a prompt and proper manner, and will see that all my debts are canceled in due time, by turning out property, or otherwise, as the case may require, or as the circumstances may admit of.

Judge ye for yourselves. God knoweth all these things, whether it be good or bad. But nevertheless, deep water is what I am wont to swim in. It all has become a second nature to me; and I feel, like Paul, to glory in tribulation; for to this day has the God of my fathers delivered me out of them all, and will deliver me from henceforth; for behold, and lo, I shall triumph over all my enemies, for the Lord God hath spoken it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.128'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.1'>[An epistle from Joseph Smith the Prophet to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, containing further directions on baptism for the dead; dated at Nauvoo, Illinois, September 6, 1842. HC 5: 148-153.] AS I stated to you in my letter before I left my place, that I would write to you from time to time and give you information in relation to many subjects, I now resume the subject of the baptism for the dead, as that subject seems to occupy my mind, and press itself upon my feelings the strongest, since I have been pursued by my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.2'>I wrote a few words of revelation to you concerning a recorder. I have had a few additional views in relation to this matter, which I now certify. That is, it was declared in my former letter that there should be a recorder, who should be eye-witness, and also to hear with his ears, that he might make a record of a truth before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.3'>Now, in relation to this matter, it would be very difficult for one recorder to be present at all times, and to do all the business. To obviate this difficulty, there can be a recorder appointed in each ward of the city, who is well qualified for taking accurate minutes; and let him be very particular and precise in taking the whole proceedings, certifying in his record that he saw with his eyes, and heard with his ears, giving the date, and names, and so forth, and the history of the whole transaction; naming also some three individuals that are present, if there be any present, who can at any time when called upon certify to the same, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.4'>Then, let there be a general recorder, to whom these other records can be handed, being attended with certificates over their own signatures, certifying that the record they have made is true. Then the general church recorder can enter the record on the general church book, with the certificates and all the attending witnesses, with his own statement that he verily believes the above statement and records to be true, from his knowledge of the general character and appointment of those men by the church. And when this is done on the general church book, the record shall be just as holy, and shall answer the ordinance just the same as if he had seen with his eyes and heard with his ears, and made a record of the same on the general church book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.5'>You may think this order of things to be very particular; but let me tell you that it is only to answer the will of God, by conforming to the ordinance and preparation that the Lord ordained and prepared before the foundation of the world, for the salvation of the dead who should die without a knowledge of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.6'>And further, I want you to remember that John the Revelator was contemplating this very subject in relation to the dead, when he declared, as you will find recorded in Revelation 20:12-And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is the book of life; and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.7'>You will discover in this quotation that the books were opened; and another book was opened, which was the book of life; but the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works; consequently, the books spoken of must be the books which contained the record of their works, and refer to the records which are kept on the earth. And the book which was the book of life is the record which is kept in heaven; the principle agreeing precisely with the doctrine which is commanded you in the revelation contained in the letter which I wrote to you previous to my leaving my place-that in all your recordings it may be recorded in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.8'>Now, the nature of this ordinance consists in the power of the priesthood, by the revelation of Jesus Christ, wherein it is granted that whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Or, in other words, taking a different view of the translation, whatsoever you record on earth shall be recorded in heaven, and whatsoever you do not record on earth shall not be recorded in heaven; for out of the books shall your dead be judged, according to their own works, whether they themselves have attended to the ordinances in their own propria persona, or by the means of their own agents, according to the ordinance which God has prepared for their salvation from before the foundation of the world, according to the records which they have kept concerning their dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.9'>It may seem to some to be a very bold doctrine that we talk of-a power which records or binds on earth and binds in heaven. Nevertheless, in all ages of the world, whenever the Lord has given a dispensation of the priesthood to any man by actual revelation, or any set of men, this power has always been given. Hence, whatsoever those men did in authority, in the name of the Lord, and did it truly and faithfully, and kept a proper and faithful record of the same, it became a law on earth and in heaven, and could not be annulled, according to the decrees of the great Jehovah. This is a faithful saying. Who can hear it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.10'>And again, for the precedent, Matthew 16:18, 19: And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.11'>Now the great and grand secret of the whole matter, and the summum bonum of the whole subject that is lying before us, consists in obtaining the powers of the Holy Priesthood. For him to whom these keys are given there is no difficulty in obtaining a knowledge of facts in relation to the salvation of the children of men, both as well for the dead as for the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.12'>Herein is glory and honor, and immortality and eternal life-The ordinance of baptism by water, to be immersed therein in order to answer to the likeness of the dead, that one principle might accord with the other; to be immersed in the water and come forth out of the water is in the likeness of the resurrection of the dead in coming forth out of their graves; hence, this ordinance was instituted to form a relationship with the ordinance of baptism for the dead, being in likeness of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.13'>Consequently, the baptismal font was instituted as a similitude of the grave, and was commanded to be in a place underneath where the living are wont to assemble, to show forth the living and the dead, and that all things may have their likeness, and that they may accord one with another-that which is earthly conforming to that which is heavenly, as Paul hath declared, 1 Corinthians 15:46, 47, and 48:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.14'>Howbeit that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual. The first man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord from heaven. As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy; and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly. And as are the records on the earth in relation to your dead, which are truly made out, so also are the records in heaven. This, therefore, is the sealing and binding power, and, in one sense of the word, the keys of the kingdom, which consist in the key of knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.15'>And now, my dearly beloved brethren and sisters, let me assure you that these are principles in relation to the dead and the living that cannot be lightly passed over, as pertaining to our salvation. For their salvation is necessary and essential to our salvation, as Paul says concerning the fathers-that they without us cannot be made perfect-neither can we without our dead be made perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.16'>And now, in relation to the baptism for the dead, I will give you another quotation of Paul, 1 Corinthians 15:29: Else what shall they do which are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? Why are they then baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.17'>And again, in connection with this quotation I will give you a quotation from one of the prophets, who had his eye fixed on the restoration of the priesthood, the glories to be revealed in the last days, and in an especial manner this most glorious of all subjects belonging to the everlasting gospel, namely, the baptism for the dead; for Malachi says, last chapter, verses 5th and 6th: Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord: And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a curse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.18'>I might have rendered a plainer translation to this, but it is sufficiently plain to suit my purpose as it stands. It is sufficient to know, in this case, that the earth will be smitten with a curse unless there is a welding link of some kind or other between the fathers and the children, upon some subject or other-and behold what is that subject? It is the baptism for the dead. For we without them cannot be made perfect; neither can they without us be made perfect. Neither can they nor we be made perfect without those who have died in the gospel also; for it is necessary in the ushering in of the dispensation of the fulness of times, which dispensation is now beginning to usher in, that a whole and complete and perfect union, and welding together of dispensations, and keys, and powers, and glories should take place, and be revealed from the days of Adam even to the present time. And not only this, but those things which never have been revealed from the foundation of the world, but have been kept hid from the wise and prudent, shall be revealed unto babes and sucklings in this, the dispensation of the fulness of times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.19'>Now, what do we hear in the gospel which we have received? A voice of gladness! A voice of mercy from heaven; and a voice of truth out of the earth; glad tidings for the dead; a voice of gladness for the living and the dead; glad tidings of great joy. How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of those that bring glad tidings of good things, and that say unto Zion: Behold, thy God reigneth! As the dews of Carmel, so shall the knowledge of God descend upon them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.20'>And again, what do we hear? Glad tidings from Cumorah! Moroni, an angel from heaven, declaring the fulfilment of the prophets-the book to be revealed. A voice of the Lord in the wilderness of Fayette, Seneca county, declaring the three witnesses to bear record of the book! The voice of Michael on the banks of the Susquehanna, detecting the devil when he appeared as an angel of light! The voice of Peter, James, and John in the wilderness between Harmony, Susquehanna county, and Colesville, Broome county, on the Susquehanna river, declaring themselves as possessing the keys of the kingdom, and of the dispensation of the fulness of times!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.21'>And again, the voice of God in the chamber of old Father Whitmer, in Fayette, Seneca county, and at sundry times, and in divers places through all the travels and tribulations of this Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints! And the voice of Michael, the archangel; the voice of Gabriel, and of Raphael, and of divers angels, from Michael or Adam down to the present time, all declaring their dispensation, their rights, their keys, their honors, their majesty and glory, and the power of their priesthood; giving line upon line, precept upon precept; here a little, and there a little; giving us consolation by holding forth that which is to come, confirming our hope!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.22'>Brethren, shall we not go on in so great a cause? Go forward and not backward. Courage, brethren; and on, on to the victory! Let your hearts rejoice, and be exceedingly glad. Let the earth break forth into singing. Let the dead speak forth anthems of eternal praise to the King Immanuel, who hath ordained, before the world was, that which would enable us to redeem them out of their prison; for the prisoners shall go free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.23'>Let the mountains shout for joy, and all ye valleys cry aloud; and all ye seas and dry lands tell the wonders of your Eternal King! And ye rivers, and brooks, and rills, flow down with gladness. Let the woods and all the trees of the field praise the Lord; and ye solid rocks weep for joy! And let the sun, moon, and the morning stars sing together, and let all the sons of God shout for joy! And let the eternal creations declare his name forever and ever! And again I say, how glorious is the voice we hear from heaven, proclaiming in our ears, glory, and salvation, and honor, and immortality, and eternal life; kingdoms, principalities, and powers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.24'>Behold, the great day of the Lord is at hand; and who can abide the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appeareth? For he is like a refiner's fire, and like fuller's soap; and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and silver, that they may offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness. Let us, therefore, as a church and a people, and as Latter-day Saints, offer unto the Lord an offering in righteousness; and let us present in his holy temple, when it is finished, a book containing the records of our dead, which shall be worthy of all acceptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.128.25'>Brethren, I have many things to say to you on the subject; but shall now close for the present, and continue the subject another time. I am, as ever, your humble servant and never deviating friend,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.132.35'>Was Abraham, therefore, under condemnation? Verily I say unto you, Nay; for I, the Lord, commanded it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.36'>Abraham was commanded to offer his son Isaac; nevertheless, it was written: Thou shalt not kill. Abraham, however, did not refuse, and it was accounted unto him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.37'>Abraham received concubines, and they bore him children; and it was accounted unto him for righteousness, because they were given unto him, and he abode in my law; as Isaac also and Jacob did none other things than that which they were commanded; and because they did none other things than that which they were commanded, they have entered into their exaltation, according to the promises, and sit upon thrones, and are not angels but are gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.38'>David also received many wives and concubines, and also Solomon and Moses my servants, as also many others of my servants, from the beginning of creation until this time; and in nothing did they sin save in those things which they received not of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.39'>David's wives and concubines were given unto him of me, by the hand of Nathan, my servant, and others of the prophets who had the keys of this power; and in none of these things did he sin against me save in the case of Uriah and his wife; and, therefore he hath fallen from his exaltation, and received his portion; and he shall not inherit them out of the world, for I gave them unto another, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.40'>I am the Lord thy God, and I gave unto thee, my servant Joseph, an appointment, and restore all things. Ask what ye will, and it shall be given unto you according to my word.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.132.42'>If she be not in the new and everlasting covenant, and she be with another man, she has committed adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.43'>And if her husband be with another woman, and he was under a vow, he hath broken his vow and hath committed adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.44'>And if she hath not committed adultery, but is innocent and hath not broken her vow, and she knoweth it, and I reveal it unto you, my servant Joseph, then shall you have power, by the power of my Holy Priesthood, to take her and give her unto him that hath not committed adultery but hath been faithful; for he shall be made ruler over many.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.132.52'>And let mine handmaid, Emma Smith, receive all those that have been given unto my servant Joseph, and who are virtuous and pure before me; and those who are not pure, and have said they were pure, shall be destroyed, saith the Lord God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.53'>For I am the Lord thy God, and ye shall obey my voice; and I give unto my servant Joseph that he shall be made ruler over many things; for he hath been faithful over a few things, and from henceforth I will strengthen him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.54'>And I command mine handmaid, Emma Smith, to abide and cleave unto my servant Joseph, and to none else. But if she will not abide this commandment she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord; for I am the Lord thy God, and will destroy her if she abide not in my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.55'>But if she will not abide this commandment, then shall my servant Joseph do all things for her, even as he hath said; and I will bless him and multiply him and give unto him an hundredfold in this world, of fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters, houses and lands, wives and children, and crowns of eternal lives in the eternal worlds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.56'>And again, verily I say, let mine handmaid forgive my servant Joseph his trespasses; and then shall she be forgiven her trespasses, wherein she has trespassed against me; and I, the Lord thy God, will bless her, and multiply her, and make her heart to rejoice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.57'>And again, I say, let not my servant Joseph put his property out of his hands, lest an enemy come and destroy him; for Satan seeketh to destroy; for I am the Lord thy God, and he is my servant; and behold, and lo, I am with him, as I was with Abraham, thy father, even unto his exaltation and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.58'>Now, as touching the law of the priesthood, there are many things pertaining thereunto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.59'>Verily, if a man be called of my Father, as was Aaron, by mine own voice, and by the voice of him that sent me, and I have endowed him with the keys of the power of this priesthood, if he do anything in my name, and according to my law and by my word, he will not commit sin, and I will justify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.60'>Let no one, therefore, set on my servant Joseph; for I will justify him; for he shall do the sacrifice which I require at his hands for his transgressions, saith the Lord your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.61'>And again, as pertaining to the law of the priesthood-if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another, and the first give her consent, and if he espouse the second, and they are virgins, and have vowed to no other man, then is he justified; he cannot commit adultery for they are given unto him; for he cannot commit adultery with that that belongeth unto him and to no one else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.62'>And if he have ten virgins given unto him by this law, he cannot commit adultery, for they belong to him, and they are given unto him; therefore is he justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.63'>But if one or either of the ten virgins, after she is espoused, shall be with another man, she has committed adultery, and shall be destroyed; for they are given unto him to multiply and replenish the earth, according to my commandment, and to fulfil the promise which was given by my Father before the foundation of the world, and for their exaltation in the eternal worlds, that they may bear the souls of men; for herein is the work of my Father continued, that he may be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.64'>And again, verily, verily, I say unto you, if any man have a wife, who holds the keys of this power, and he teaches unto her the law of my priesthood, as pertaining to these things, then shall she believe and administer unto him, or she shall be destroyed, saith the Lord your God; for I will destroy her; for I will magnify my name upon all those who receive and abide in my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.65'>Therefore, it shall be lawful in me, if she receive not this law, for him to receive all things whatsoever I, the Lord his God, will give unto him, because she did not believe and administer unto him according to my word; and she then becomes the transgressor; and he is exempt from the law of Sarah, who administered unto Abraham according to the law when I commanded Abraham to take Hagar to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.132.66'>And now, as pertaining to this law, verily, verily, I say unto you, I will reveal more unto you, hereafter; therefore, let this suffice for the present. Behold, I am Alpha and Omega. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.134.1'>[A declaration of belief regarding governments and laws in general, adopted by unanimous vote at a general assembly of the Church held at Kirtland, Ohio, August 17, 1835. HC 2: 247-249. The occasion was a meeting of Church leaders, brought together to consider the proposed contents of the first edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. At that time this declaration was given the following preamble: "That our belief with regard to earthly governments and laws in general may not be misinterpreted nor misunderstood, we have thought proper to present at the close of this volume our opinion concerning the same."] WE believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.2'>We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.3'>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.4'>We believe that religion is instituted of God; and that men are amenable to him, and to him only, for the exercise of it, unless their religious opinions prompt them to infringe upon the rights and liberties of others; but we do not believe that human law has a right to interfere in prescribing rules of worship to bind the consciences of men, nor dictate forms for public or private devotion; that the civil magistrate should restrain crime, but never control conscience; should punish guilt, but never suppress the freedom of the soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.5'>We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; and that sedition and rebellion are unbecoming every citizen thus protected, and should be punished accordingly; and that all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.6'>We believe that every man should be honored in his station, rulers and magistrates as such, being placed for the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty; and that to the laws all men show respect and deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and nations, between man and man; and divine laws given of heaven, prescribing rules on spiritual concerns, for faith and worship, both to be answered by man to his Maker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.7'>We believe that rulers, states, and governments have a right, and are bound to enact laws for the protection of all citizens in the free exercise of their religious belief; but we do not believe that they have a right in justice to deprive citizens of this privilege, or proscribe them in their opinions, so long as a regard and reverence are shown to the laws and such religious opinions do not justify sedition nor conspiracy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.134.8'>We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that government in which the offense is committed; and for the public peace and tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders against good laws to punishment.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.134.12'>We believe it just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world; but we do not believe it right to interfere with bond-servants, neither preach the gospel to, nor baptize them contrary to the will and wish of their masters, nor to meddle with or influence them in the least to cause them to be dissatisfied with their situations in this life, thereby jeopardizing the lives of men; such interference we believe to be unlawful and unjust, and dangerous to the peace of every government allowing human beings to be held in servitude.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.135.1'>[Martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet and his brother, Hyrum Smith the Patriarch, at Carthage, Illinois, June 27, 1844. HC 6: 629-631. This document was written by Elder John Taylor of the Council of the Twelve, who was a witness to the events.] TO seal the testimony of this book and the Book of Mormon, we announce the martyrdom of Joseph Smith the Prophet, and Hyrum Smith the Patriarch. They were shot in Carthage jail, on the 27th of June, 1844, about five o'clock p.m., by an armed mob-painted black-of from 150 to 200 persons. Hyrum was shot first and fell calmly, exclaiming: I am a dead man! Joseph leaped from the window, and was shot dead in the attempt, exclaiming: O Lord my God! They were both shot after they were dead, in a brutal manner, and both received four balls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.2'>John Taylor and Willard Richards, two of the Twelve, were the only persons in the room at the time; the former was wounded in a savage manner with four balls, but has since recovered; the latter, through the providence of God, escaped, without even a hole in his robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.3'>Joseph Smith, the Prophet and Seer of the Lord, has done more, save Jesus only, for the salvation of men in this world, than any other man that ever lived in it. In the short space of twenty years, he has brought forth the Book of Mormon, which he translated by the gift and power of God, and has been the means of publishing it on two continents; has sent the fulness of the everlasting gospel, which it contained, to the four quarters of the earth; has brought forth the revelations and commandments which compose this book of Doctrine and Covenants, and many other wise documents and instructions for the benefit of the children of men; gathered many thousands of the Latter-day Saints, founded a great city, and left a fame and name that cannot be slain. He lived great, and he died great in the eyes of God and his people; and like most of the Lord's anointed in ancient times, has sealed his mission and his works with his own blood; and so has his brother Hyrum. In life they were not divided, and in death they were not separated!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.4'>When Joseph went to Carthage to deliver himself up to the pretended requirements of the law, two or three days previous to his assassination, he said: "I am going like a lamb to the slaughter; but I am calm as a summer's morning; I have a conscience void of offense towards God, and towards all men. I SHALL DIE INNOCENT, AND IT SHALL YET BE SAID OF ME-HE WAS MURDERED IN COLD BLOOD."-The same morning, after Hyrum had made ready to go-shall it be said to the slaughter? yes, for so it was-he read the following paragraph, near the close of the twelfth chapter of Ether, in the Book of Mormon, and turned down the leaf upon it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.5'>And it came to pass that I prayed unto the Lord that he would give unto the Gentiles grace, that they might have charity. And it came to pass that the Lord said unto me: If they have not charity it mattereth not unto thee, thou hast been faithful; wherefore thy garments shall be made clean. And because thou hast seen thy weakness, thou shalt be made strong, even unto the sitting down in the place which I have prepared in the mansions of my Father. And now I . . . bid farewell unto the Gentiles; yea, and also unto my brethren whom I love, until we shall meet before the judgment-seat of Christ, where all men shall know that my garments are not spotted with your blood. The testators are now dead, and their testament is in force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.6'>Hyrum Smith was forty-four years old in February, 1844, and Joseph Smith was thirty-eight in December, 1843; and henceforward their names will be classed among the martyrs of religion; and the reader in every nation will be reminded that the Book of Mormon, and this book of Doctrine and Covenants of the church, cost the best blood of the nineteenth century to bring them forth for the salvation of a ruined world; and that if the fire can scathe a green tree for the glory of God, how easy it will burn up the dry trees to purify the vineyard of corruption. They lived for glory; they died for glory; and glory is their eternal reward. From age to age shall their names go down to posterity as gems for the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.135.7'>They were innocent of any crime, as they had often been proved before, and were only confined in jail by the conspiracy of traitors and wicked men; and their innocent blood on the floor of Carthage jail is a broad seal affixed to "Mormonism" that cannot be rejected by any court on earth, and their innocent blood on the escutcheon of the State of Illinois, with the broken faith of the State as pledged by the governor, is a witness to the truth of the everlasting gospel that all the world cannot impeach; and their innocent blood on the banner of liberty, and on the magna charta of the United States, is an ambassador for the religion of Jesus Christ, that will touch the hearts of honest men among all nations; and their innocent blood, with the innocent blood of all the martyrs under the altar that John saw, will cry unto the Lord of Hosts till he avenges that blood on the earth. Amen.</verse>

In his opening address at the eighty-ninth Semiannual General Conference of the Church, on October 4, 1918, President Smith declared that he had received several divine communications during the previous months. One of these, concerning the Savior's visit to the spirits of the dead while his body was in the tomb, he had received the previous day. It was written immediately following the close of the conference; on October 31, 1918, it was submitted to the counselors in the First Presidency, the Council of the Twelve, and the Patriarch, and it was unanimously accepted by them.] ON the third of October, in the year nineteen hundred and eighteen, I sat in my room pondering over the scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.2'>And reflecting upon the great atoning sacrifice that was made by the Son of God, for the redemption of the world;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.138.6'>I opened the Bible and read the third and fourth chapters of the first epistle of Peter, and as I read I was greatly impressed, more than I had ever been before, with the following passages:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.138.7'>"For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.138.29'>And as I wondered, my eyes were opened, and my understanding quickened, and I perceived that the Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>OFFICIAL DECLARATION-1</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>To Whom It May Concern:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>Press dispatches having been sent for political purposes, from Salt Lake City, which have been widely published, to the effect that the Utah Commission, in their recent report to the Secretary of the Interior, allege that plural marriages are still being solemnized and that forty or more such marriages have been contracted in Utah since last June or during the past year, also that in public discourses the leaders of the Church have taught, encouraged and urged the continuance of the practice of polygamy-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>I, therefore, as President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, do hereby, in the most solemn manner, declare that these charges are false. We are not teaching polygamy or plural marriage, nor permitting any person to enter into its practice, and I deny that either forty or any other number of plural marriages have during that period been solemnized in our Temples or in any other place in the Territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>One case has been reported, in which the parties allege that the marriage was performed in the Endowment House, in Salt Lake City, in the Spring of 1889, but I have not been able to learn who performed the ceremony; whatever was done in this matter was without my knowledge. In consequence of this alleged occurrence the Endowment House was, by my instructions, taken down without delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>Inasmuch as laws have been enacted by Congress forbidding plural marriages, which laws have been pronounced constitutional by the court of last resort, I hereby declare my intention to submit to those laws, and to use my influence with the members of the Church over which I preside to have them do likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>There is nothing in my teachings to the Church or in those of my associates, during the time specified, which can be reasonably construed to inculcate or encourage polygamy; and when any Elder of the Church has used language which appeared to convey any such teaching, he has been promptly reproved. And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>WILFORD WOODRUFF</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>President Lorenzo Snow offered the following:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>"I move that, recognizing Wilford Woodruff as the President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and the only man on the earth at the present time who holds the keys of the sealing ordinances, we consider him fully authorized by virtue of his position to issue the Manifesto which has been read in our hearing, and which is dated September 24th, 1890, and that as a Church in General Conference assembled, we accept his declaration concerning plural marriages as authoritative and binding."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>The vote to sustain the foregoing motion was unanimous.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>PRESIDENT WILFORD WOODRUFF</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>REGARDING THE MANIFESTO</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>The Lord will never permit me or any other man who stands as President of this Church to lead you astray. It is not in the programme. It is not in the mind of God. If I were to attempt that, the Lord would remove me out of my place, and so He will any other man who attempts to lead the children of men astray from the oracles of God and from their duty. (Sixty-first Semiannual General Conference of the Church, Monday, October 6, 1890, Salt Lake City, Utah. Reported in Deseret Evening News, October 11, 1890, p. 2.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>It matters not who lives or who dies, or who is called to lead this Church, they have got to lead it by the inspiration of Almighty God. If they do not do it that way, they cannot do it at all. . . .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>I have had some revelations of late, and very important ones to me, and I will tell you what the Lord has said to me. Let me bring your minds to what is termed the manifesto. . . .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>The Lord has told me to ask the Latter-day Saints a question, and He also told me that if they would listen to what I said to them and answer the question put to them, by the Spirit and power of God, they would all answer alike, and they would all believe alike with regard to this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>The question is this: Which is the wisest course for the Latter-day Saints to pursue-to continue to attempt to practice plural marriage, with the laws of the nation against it and the opposition of sixty millions of people, and at the cost of the confiscation and loss of all the Temples, and the stopping of all the ordinances therein, both for the living and the dead, and the imprisonment of the First Presidency and Twelve and the heads of families in the Church, and the confiscation of personal property of the people (all of which of themselves would stop the practice); or, after doing and suffering what we have through our adherence to this principle to cease the practice and submit to the law, and through doing so leave the Prophets, Apostles and fathers at home, so that they can instruct the people and attend to the duties of the Church, and also leave the Temples in the hands of the Saints, so that they can attend to the ordinances of the Gospel, both for the living and the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>The Lord showed me by vision and revelation exactly what would take place if we did not stop this practice. If we had not stopped it, you would have had no use for . . . any of the men in this temple at Logan; for all ordinances would be stopped throughout the land of Zion. Confusion would reign throughout Israel, and many men would be made prisoners. This trouble would have come upon the whole Church, and we should have been compelled to stop the practice. Now, the question is, whether it should be stopped in this manner, or in the way the Lord has manifested to us, and leave our Prophets and Apostles and fathers free men, and the temples in the hands of the people, so that the dead may be redeemed. A large number has already been delivered from the prison house in the spirit world by this people, and shall the work go on or stop? This is the question I lay before the Latter-day Saints. You have to judge for yourselves. I want you to answer it for yourselves. I shall not answer it; but I say to you that that is exactly the condition we as a people would have been in had we not taken the course we have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.23'>. . . I saw exactly what would come to pass if there was not something done. I have had this spirit upon me for a long time. But I want to say this: I should have let all the temples go out of our hands; I should have gone to prison myself, and let every other man go there, had not the God of heaven commanded me to do what I did do; and when the hour came that I was commanded to do that, it was all clear to me. I went before the Lord, and I wrote what the Lord told me to write. . . .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.24'>I leave this with you, for you to contemplate and consider. The Lord is at work with us. (Cache Stake Conference, Logan, Utah, Sunday, November 1, 1891. Reported in Deseret Weekly, November 14, 1891.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.25'>Now I will tell you what was manifested to me and what the Son of God performed in this thing. . . . All these things would have come to pass, as God Almighty lives, had not that Manifesto been given. Therefore, the Son of God felt disposed to have that thing presented to the Church and to the world for purposes in his own mind. The Lord had decreed the establishment of Zion. He had decreed the finishing of this temple. He had decreed that the salvation of the living and the dead should be given in these valleys of the mountains. And Almighty God decreed that the Devil should not thwart it. If you can understand that, that is a key to it.

        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>OFFICIAL DECLARATION-2</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>To Whom It May Concern:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>On September 30, 1978, at the 148th Semiannual General Conference of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, the following was presented by President N. Eldon Tanner, First Counselor in the First Presidency of the Church:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>In early June of this year, the First Presidency announced that a revelation had been received by President Spencer W. Kimball extending priesthood and temple blessings to all worthy male members of the Church. President Kimball has asked that I advise the conference that after he had received this revelation, which came to him after extended meditation and prayer in the sacred rooms of the holy temple, he presented it to his counselors, who accepted it and approved it. It was then presented to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, who unanimously approved it, and was subsequently presented to all other General Authorities, who likewise approved it unanimously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>President Kimball has asked that I now read this letter:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>June 8, 1978</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>To all general and local priesthood officers of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints throughout the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>Dear Brethren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>As we have witnessed the expansion of the work of the Lord over the earth, we have been grateful that people of many nations have responded to the message of the restored gospel, and have joined the Church in ever-increasing numbers. This, in turn, has inspired us with a desire to extend to every worthy member of the Church all of the privileges and blessings which the gospel affords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Aware of the promises made by the prophets and presidents of the Church who have preceded us that at some time, in God's eternal plan, all of our brethren who are worthy may receive the priesthood, and witnessing the faithfulness of those from whom the priesthood has been withheld, we have pleaded long and earnestly in behalf of these, our faithful brethren, spending many hours in the Upper Room of the Temple supplicating the Lord for divine guidance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>He has heard our prayers, and by revelation has confirmed that the long-promised day has come when every faithful, worthy man in the Church may receive the holy priesthood, with power to exercise its divine authority, and enjoy with his loved ones every blessing that flows therefrom, including the blessings of the temple. Accordingly, all worthy male members of the Church may be ordained to the priesthood without regard for race or color. Priesthood leaders are instructed to follow the policy of carefully interviewing all candidates for ordination to either the Aaronic or the Melchizedek Priesthood to insure that they meet the established standards for worthiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>We declare with soberness that the Lord has now made known his will for the blessing of all his children throughout the earth who will hearken to the voice of his authorized servants, and prepare themselves to receive every blessing of the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>Sincerely yours,</verse>

All in favor please signify by raising your right hand. Any opposed by the same sign.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.1.1'>The words of God, which he spake unto Moses at a time when Moses was caught up into an exceedingly high mountain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.2'>And he saw God face to face, and he talked with him, and the glory of God was upon Moses; therefore Moses could endure his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.3'>And God spake unto Moses, saying: Behold, I am the Lord God Almighty, and Endless is my name; for I am without beginning of days or end of years; and is not this endless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.4'>And, behold, thou art my son; wherefore look, and I will show thee the workmanship of mine hands; but not all, for my works are without end, and also my words, for they never cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.5'>Wherefore, no man can behold all my works, except he behold all my glory; and no man can behold all my glory, and afterwards remain in the flesh on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.6'>And I have a work for thee, Moses, my son; and thou art in the similitude of mine Only Begotten; and mine Only Begotten is and shall be the Savior, for he is full of grace and truth; but there is no God beside me, and all things are present with me, for I know them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.7'>And now, behold, this one thing I show unto thee, Moses, my son, for thou art in the world, and now I show it unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.8'>And it came to pass that Moses looked, and beheld the world upon which he was created; and Moses beheld the world and the ends thereof, and all the children of men which are, and which were created; of the same he greatly marveled and wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.9'>And the presence of God withdrew from Moses, that his glory was not upon Moses; and Moses was left unto himself. And as he was left unto himself, he fell unto the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.10'>And it came to pass that it was for the space of many hours before Moses did again receive his natural strength like unto man; and he said unto himself: Now, for this cause I know that man is nothing, which thing I never had supposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.11'>But now mine own eyes have beheld God; but not my natural, but my spiritual eyes, for my natural eyes could not have beheld; for I should have withered and died in his presence; but his glory was upon me; and I beheld his face, for I was transfigured before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.12'>And it came to pass that when Moses had said these words, behold, Satan came tempting him, saying: Moses, son of man, worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.13'>And it came to pass that Moses looked upon Satan and said: Who art thou? For behold, I am a son of God, in the similitude of his Only Begotten; and where is thy glory, that I should worship thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.14'>For behold, I could not look upon God, except his glory should come upon me, and I were transfigured before him. But I can look upon thee in the natural man. Is it not so, surely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.15'>Blessed be the name of my God, for his Spirit hath not altogether withdrawn from me, or else where is thy glory, for it is darkness unto me? And I can judge between thee and God; for God said unto me: Worship God, for him only shalt thou serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.16'>Get thee hence, Satan; deceive me not; for God said unto me: Thou art after the similitude of mine Only Begotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.17'>And he also gave me commandments when he called unto me out of the burning bush, saying: Call upon God in the name of mine Only Begotten, and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.18'>And again Moses said: I will not cease to call upon God, I have other things to inquire of him: for his glory has been upon me, wherefore I can judge between him and thee. Depart hence, Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.19'>And now, when Moses had said these words, Satan cried with a loud voice, and ranted upon the earth, and commanded, saying: I am the Only Begotten, worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.20'>And it came to pass that Moses began to fear exceedingly; and as he began to fear, he saw the bitterness of hell. Nevertheless, calling upon God, he received strength, and he commanded, saying: Depart from me, Satan, for this one God only will I worship, which is the God of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.21'>And now Satan began to tremble, and the earth shook; and Moses received strength, and called upon God, saying: In the name of the Only Begotten, depart hence, Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.22'>And it came to pass that Satan cried with a loud voice, with weeping, and wailing, and gnashing of teeth; and he departed hence, even from the presence of Moses, that he beheld him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.23'>And now of this thing Moses bore record; but because of wickedness it is not had among the children of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.24'>And it came to pass that when Satan had departed from the presence of Moses, that Moses lifted up his eyes unto heaven, being filled with the Holy Ghost, which beareth record of the Father and the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.25'>And calling upon the name of God, he beheld his glory again, for it was upon him; and he heard a voice, saying: Blessed art thou, Moses, for I, the Almighty, have chosen thee, and thou shalt be made stronger than many waters; for they shall obey thy command as if thou wert God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.26'>And lo, I am with thee, even unto the end of thy days; for thou shalt deliver my people from bondage, even Israel my chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.27'>And it came to pass, as the voice was still speaking, Moses cast his eyes and beheld the earth, yea, even all of it; and there was not a particle of it which he did not behold, discerning it by the spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.28'>And he beheld also the inhabitants thereof, and there was not a soul which he beheld not; and he discerned them by the Spirit of God; and their numbers were great, even numberless as the sand upon the sea shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.29'>And he beheld many lands; and each land was called earth, and there were inhabitants on the face thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.30'>And it came to pass that Moses called upon God, saying: Tell me, I pray thee, why these things are so, and by what thou madest them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.31'>And behold, the glory of the Lord was upon Moses, so that Moses stood in the presence of God, and talked with him face to face. And the Lord God said unto Moses: For mine own purpose have I made these things. Here is wisdom and it remaineth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.32'>And by the word of my power, have I created them, which is mine Only Begotten Son, who is full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.33'>And worlds without number have I created; and I also created them for mine own purpose; and by the Son I created them, which is mine Only Begotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.34'>And the first man of all men have I called Adam, which is many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.35'>But only an account of this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, give I unto you. For behold, there are many worlds that have passed away by the word of my power. And there are many that now stand, and innumerable are they unto man; but all things are numbered unto me, for they are mine and I know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.36'>And it came to pass that Moses spake unto the Lord, saying: Be merciful unto thy servant, O God, and tell me concerning this earth, and the inhabitants thereof, and also the heavens, and then thy servant will be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.37'>And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.38'>And as one earth shall pass away, and the heavens thereof even so shall another come, and there is no end to my works, neither to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.39'>For behold, this is my work and my glory to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.40'>And now, Moses, my son, I will speak unto thee concerning this earth upon which thou standest; and thou shalt write the things which I shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.41'>And in a day when the children of men shall esteem my words as naught and take many of them from the book which thou shalt write, behold, I will raise up another like unto thee; and they shall be had again among the children of men-among as many as shall believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.1.42'>(These words were spoken unto Moses in the mount, the name of which shall not be known among the children of men. And now they are spoken unto you. Show them not unto any except them that believe. Even so. Amen.)</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.1'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>In the land of the Chaldeans, at the residence of my fathers, I, Abraham, saw that it was needful for me to obtain another place of residence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>And, finding there was greater happiness and peace and rest for me, I sought for the blessings of the fathers, and the right whereunto I should be ordained to administer the same; having been myself a follower of righteousness, desiring also to be one who possessed great knowledge, and to be a greater follower of righteousness, and to possess a greater knowledge, and to be a father of many nations, a prince of peace, and desiring to receive instructions, and to keep the commandments of God, I became a rightful heir, a High Priest, holding the right belonging to the fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>It was conferred upon me from the fathers; it came down from the fathers, from the beginning of time, yea, even from the beginning, or before the foundation of the earth, down to the present time, even the right of the firstborn, or the first man, who is Adam, or first father, through the fathers unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>I sought for mine appointment unto the Priesthood according to the appointment of God unto the fathers concerning the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>My fathers having turned from their righteousness, and from the holy commandments which the Lord their God had given unto them, unto the worshiping of the gods of the heathen, utterly refused to hearken to my voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>For their hearts were set to do evil, and were wholly turned to the god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of Pharaoh, king of Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>Therefore they turned their hearts to the sacrifice of the heathen in offering up their children unto these dumb idols, and hearkened not unto my voice, but endeavored to take away my life by the hand of the priest of Elkenah. The priest of Elkenah was also the priest of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>Now, at this time it was the custom of the priest of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, to offer up upon the altar which was built in the land of Chaldea, for the offering unto these strange gods, men, women, and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>And it came to pass that the priest made an offering unto the god of Pharaoh, and also unto the god of Shagreel, even after the manner of the Egyptians. Now the god of Shagreel was the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>Even the thank-offering of a child did the priest of Pharaoh offer upon the altar which stood by the hill called Potiphar's Hill, at the head of the plain of Olishem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>Now, this priest had offered upon this altar three virgins at one time, who were the daughters of Onitah, one of the royal descent directly from the loins of Ham. These virgins were offered up because of their virtue; they would not bow down to worship gods of wood or of stone, therefore they were killed upon this altar, and it was done after the manner of the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>And it came to pass that the priests laid violence upon me, that they might slay me also, as they did those virgins upon this altar; and that you may have a knowledge of this altar, I will refer you to the representation at the commencement of this record.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>It was made after the form of a bedstead, such as was had among the Chaldeans, and it stood before the gods of Elkenah, Libnah, Mahmackrah, Korash, and also a god like unto that of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>That you may have an understanding of these gods, I have given you the fashion of them in the figures at the beginning, which manner of figures is called by the Chaldeans Rahleenos, which signifies hieroglyphics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>And as they lifted up their hands upon me, that they might offer me up and take away my life, behold, I lifted up my voice unto the Lord my God, and the Lord hearkened and heard, and he filled me with the vision of the Almighty, and the angel of his presence stood by me, and immediately unloosed my bands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>And his voice was unto me: Abraham, Abraham, behold, my name is Jehovah, and I have heard thee, and have come down to deliver thee, and to take thee away from thy father's house, and from all thy kinsfolk, into a strange land which thou knowest not of;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>And this because they have turned their hearts away from me, to worship the god of Elkenah, and the god of Libnah, and the god of Mahmackrah, and the god of Korash, and the god of Pharaoh, king of Egypt; therefore I have come down to visit them, and to destroy him who hath lifted up his hand against thee, Abraham, my son, to take away thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>Behold, I will lead thee by my hand, and I will take thee, to put upon thee my name, even the Priesthood of thy father, and my power shall be over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>As it was with Noah so shall it be with thee; but through thy ministry my name shall be known in the earth forever, for I am thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Behold, Potiphar's Hill was in the land of Ur, of Chaldea. And the Lord broke down the altar of Elkenah, and of the gods of the land, and utterly destroyed them, and smote the priest that he died; and there was great mourning in Chaldea, and also in the court of Pharaoh; which Pharaoh signifies king by royal blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>Now this king of Egypt was a descendant from the loins of Ham, and was a partaker of the blood of the Canaanites by birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>From this descent sprang all the Egyptians, and thus the blood of the Canaanites was preserved in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>The land of Egypt being first discovered by a woman, who was the daughter of Ham, and the daughter of Egyptus, which in the Chaldean signifies Egypt, which signifies that which is forbidden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>When this woman discovered the land it was under water, who afterward settled her sons in it; and thus, from Ham, sprang that race which preserved the curse in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>Now the first government of Egypt was established by Pharaoh, the eldest son of Egyptus, the daughter of Ham, and it was after the manner of the government of Ham, which was patriarchal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>Pharaoh, being a righteous man, established his kingdom and judged his people wisely and justly all his days, seeking earnestly to imitate that order established by the fathers in the first generations, in the days of the first patriarchal reign, even in the reign of Adam, and also of Noah, his father, who blessed him with the blessings of the earth, and with the blessings of wisdom, but cursed him as pertaining to the Priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>Now, Pharaoh being of that lineage by which he could not have the right of Priesthood, notwithstanding the Pharaohs would fain claim it from Noah, through Ham, therefore my father was led away by their idolatry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>But I shall endeavor, hereafter, to delineate the chronology running back from myself to the beginning of the creation, for the records have come into my hands, which I hold unto this present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>Now, after the priest of Elkenah was smitten that he died, there came a fulfilment of those things which were said unto me concerning the land of Chaldea, that there should be a famine in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>Accordingly a famine prevailed throughout all the land of Chaldea, and my father was sorely tormented because of the famine, and he repented of the evil which he had determined against me, to take away my life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>But the records of the fathers, even the patriarchs, concerning the right of Priesthood, the Lord my God preserved in mine own hands; therefore a knowledge of the beginning of the creation, and also of the planets, and of the stars, as they were made known unto the fathers, have I kept even unto this day, and I shall endeavor to write some of these things upon this record, for the benefit of my posterity that shall come after me.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.2'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.1'>Now the Lord God caused the famine to wax sore in the land of Ur, insomuch that Haran, my brother, died; but Terah, my father, yet lived in the land of Ur, of the Chaldees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.2'>And it came to pass that I, Abraham, took Sarai to wife, and Nahor, my brother, took Milcah to wife, who was the daughter of Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Now the Lord had said unto me: Abraham, get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will show thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>Therefore I left the land of Ur, of the Chaldees, to go into the land of Canaan; and I took Lot, my brother's son, and his wife, and Sarai my wife; and also my father followed after me, unto the land which we denominated Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>And the famine abated; and my father tarried in Haran and dwelt there, as there were many flocks in Haran; and my father turned again unto his idolatry, therefore he continued in Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>But I, Abraham, and Lot, my brother's son, prayed unto the Lord, and the Lord appeared unto me, and said unto me: Arise, and take Lot with thee; for I have purposed to take thee away out of Haran, and to make of thee a minister to bear my name in a strange land which I will give unto thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession, when they hearken to my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.7'>For I am the Lord thy God; I dwell in heaven; the earth is my footstool; I stretch my hand over the sea, and it obeys my voice; I cause the wind and the fire to be my chariot; I say to the mountains Depart hence and behold, they are taken away by a whirlwind, in an instant, suddenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>My name is Jehovah, and I know the end from the beginning; therefore my hand shall be over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee above measure, and make thy name great among all nations, and thou shalt be a blessing unto thy seed after thee, that in their hands they shall bear this ministry and Priesthood unto all nations;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>Now, after the Lord had withdrawn from speaking to me, and withdrawn his face from me, I said in my heart: Thy servant has sought thee earnestly; now I have found thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Thou didst send thine angel to deliver me from the gods of Elkenah, and I will do well to hearken unto thy voice, therefore let thy servant rise up and depart in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>So I, Abraham, departed as the Lord had said unto me, and Lot with me; and I, Abraham, was sixty and two years old when I departed out of Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>And I took Sarai, whom I took to wife when I was in Ur, in Chaldea, and Lot, my brother's son, and all our substance that we had gathered, and the souls that we had won in Haran, and came forth in the way to the land of Canaan, and dwelt in tents as we came on our way;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>Therefore, eternity was our covering and our rock and our salvation, as we journeyed from Haran by the way of Jershon, to come to the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>Now I, Abraham, built an altar in the land of Jershon, and made an offering unto the Lord, and prayed that the famine might be turned away from my father's house, that they might not perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>And then we passed from Jershon through the land unto the place of Sechem; it was situated in the plains of Moreh, and we had already come into the borders of the land of the Canaanites, and I offered sacrifice there in the plains of Moreh, and called on the Lord devoutly, because we had already come into the land of this idolatrous nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>And the Lord appeared unto me in answer to my prayers, and said unto me: Unto thy seed will I give this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>And I, Abraham, arose from the place of the altar which I had built unto the Lord, and removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched my tent there, Bethel on the west, and Hai on the east; and there I built another altar unto the Lord, and called again upon the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>And I, Abraham, journeyed, going on still towards the south; and there was a continuation of a famine in the land; and I, Abraham, concluded to go down into Egypt, to sojourn there, for the famine became very grievous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>And it came to pass when I was come near to enter into Egypt, the Lord said unto me: Behold, Sarai, thy wife, is a very fair woman to look upon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.23'>Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see her, they will say She is his wife; and they will kill you, but they will save her alive; therefore see that ye do on this wise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.24'>Let her say unto the Egyptians, she is thy sister, and thy soul shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.25'>And it came to pass that I, Abraham, told Sarai, my wife, all that the Lord had said unto me Therefore say unto them, I pray thee, thou art my sister, that it may be well with me for thy sake, and my soul shall live because of thee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.3'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.1'>And I, Abraham, had the Urim and Thummim, which the Lord my God had given unto me, in Ur of the Chaldees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.2'>And I saw the stars, that they were very great, and that one of them was nearest unto the throne of God; and there were many great ones which were near unto it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>And the Lord said unto me: These are the governing ones; and the name of the great one is Kolob, because it is near unto me, for I am the Lord thy God: I have set this one to govern all those which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>And the Lord said unto me, by the Urim and Thummim, that Kolob was after the manner of the Lord, according to its times and seasons in the revolutions thereof; that one revolution was a day unto the Lord, after his manner of reckoning, it being one thousand years according to the time appointed unto that whereon thou standest. This is the reckoning of the Lord's time, according to the reckoning of Kolob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>And the Lord said unto me: The planet which is the lesser light, lesser than that which is to rule the day, even the night, is above or greater than that upon which thou standest in point of reckoning, for it moveth in order more slow; this is in order because it standeth above the earth upon which thou standest, therefore the reckoning of its time is not so many as to its number of days, and of months, and of years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>And the Lord said unto me: Now, Abraham, these two facts exist, behold thine eyes see it; it is given unto thee to know the times of reckoning, and the set time, yea, the set time of the earth upon which thou standest, and the set time of the greater light which is set to rule the day, and the set time of the lesser light which is set to rule the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Now the set time of the lesser light is a longer time as to its reckoning than the reckoning of the time of the earth upon which thou standest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>And where these two facts exist, there shall be another fact above them, that is, there shall be another planet whose reckoning of time shall be longer still;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>And thus there shall be the reckoning of the time of one planet above another, until thou come nigh unto Kolob, which Kolob is after the reckoning of the Lord's time; which Kolob is set nigh unto the throne of God, to govern all those planets which belong to the same order as that upon which thou standest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>And it is given unto thee to know the set time of all the stars that are set to give light, until thou come near unto the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>Thus I, Abraham, talked with the Lord, face to face, as one man talketh with another; and he told me of the works which his hands had made;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>And he said unto me: My son, my son (and his hand was stretched out), behold I will show you all these. And he put his hand upon mine eyes, and I saw those things which his hands had made, which were many; and they multiplied before mine eyes, and I could not see the end thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>And he said unto me: This is Shinehah, which is the sun. And he said unto me: Kokob, which is star. And he said unto me: Olea, which is the moon. And he said unto me: Kokaubeam, which signifies stars, or all the great lights, which were in the firmament of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>And it was in the night time when the Lord spake these words unto me: I will multiply thee, and thy seed after thee, like unto these; and if thou canst count the number of sands, so shall be the number of thy seeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>And the Lord said unto me: Abraham, I show these things unto thee before ye go into Egypt, that ye may declare all these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>If two things exist, and there be one above the other, there shall be greater things above them; therefore Kolob is the greatest of all the Kokaubeam that thou hast seen, because it is nearest unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Now, if there be two things, one above the other, and the moon be above the earth, then it may be that a planet or a star may exist above it; and there is nothing that the Lord thy God shall take in his heart to do but what he will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>Howbeit that he made the greater star; as, also, if there be two spirits, and one shall be more intelligent than the other, yet these two spirits, notwithstanding one is more intelligent than the other, have no beginning; they existed before, they shall have no end, they shall exist after, for they are gnolaum, or eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>And the Lord said unto me: These two facts do exist, that there are two spirits, one being more intelligent than the other; there shall be another more intelligent than they; I am the Lord thy God, I am more intelligent than they all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>The Lord thy God sent his angel to deliver thee from the hands of the priest of Elkenah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.21'>I dwell in the midst of them all; I now, therefore, have come down unto thee to declare unto thee the works which my hands have made, wherein my wisdom excelleth them all, for I rule in the heavens above, and in the earth beneath, in all wisdom and prudence, over all the intelligences thine eyes have seen from the beginning; I came down in the beginning in the midst of all the intelligences thou hast seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.22'>Now the Lord had shown unto me, Abraham, the intelligences that were organized before the world was; and among all these there were many of the noble and great ones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.23'>And God saw these souls that they were good, and he stood in the midst of them, and he said: These I will make my rulers; for he stood among those that were spirits, and he saw that they were good; and he said unto me: Abraham, thou art one of them; thou wast chosen before thou wast born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.24'>And there stood one among them that was like unto God, and he said unto those who were with him: We will go down, for there is space there, and we will take of these materials, and we will make an earth whereon these may dwell;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.25'>And we will prove them herewith, to see if they will do all things whatsoever the Lord their God shall command them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.26'>And they who keep their first estate shall be added upon; and they who keep not their first estate shall not have glory in the same kingdom with those who keep their first estate; and they who keep their second estate shall have glory added upon their heads for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.27'>And the Lord said: Whom shall I send? And one answered like unto the Son of Man: Here am I, send me. And another answered and said: Here am I, send me. And the Lord said: I will send the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.28'>And the second was angry, and kept not his first estate; and, at that day, many followed after him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Prov.4'>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.1'>And then the Lord said: Let us go down. And they went down at the beginning, and they, that is the Gods, organized and formed the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>And the earth, after it was formed, was empty and desolate, because they had not formed anything but the earth; and darkness reigned upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of the Gods was brooding upon the face of the waters.</verse>

And it came to pass that from the evening until morning they called night; and from the morning until the evening they called day; and this was the first, or the beginning, of that which they called day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.6'>And the Gods also said: Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and it shall divide the waters from the waters.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.23'>Behold, I speak these things unto you for the elect's sake; and you also shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars; see that ye be not troubled, for all I have told you must come to pass; but the end is not yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.24'>Behold, I have told you before;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.25'>Wherefore, if they shall say unto you: Behold, he is in the desert; go not forth: Behold, he is in the secret chambers; believe it not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.26'>For as the light of the morning cometh out of the east, and shineth even unto the west, and covereth the whole earth, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.27'>And now I show unto you a parable. Behold, wheresoever the carcass is, there will the eagles be gathered together; so likewise shall mine elect be gathered from the four quarters of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.29'>Behold I speak for mine elect's sake; for nation shall rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom; there shall be famines, and pestilences, and earthquakes, in divers places.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.33'>And immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun shall be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.35'>Although, the days will come, that heaven and earth shall pass away; yet my words shall not pass away, but all shall be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.36'>And, as I said before, after the tribulation of those days, and the powers of the heavens shall be shaken, then shall appear the sign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn; and they shall see the Son of Man coming in the clouds of heaven, with power and great glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eccl.1.37'>And whoso treasureth up my word, shall not be deceived, for the Son of Man shall come, and he shall send his angels before him with the great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together the remainder of his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Song.1'>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.1'>Owing to the many reports which have been put in circulation by evil-disposed and designing persons, in relation to the rise and progress of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, all of which have been designed by the authors thereof to militate against its character as a Church and its progress in the world I have been induced to write this history, to disabuse the public mind, and put all inquirers after truth in possession of the facts, as they have transpired, in relation both to myself and the Church, so far as I have such facts in my possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.2'>In this history I shall present the various events in relation to this Church, in truth and righteousness, as they have transpired, or as they at present exist, being now [1838] the eighth year since the organization of the said Church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.3'>I was born in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and five, on the twenty-third day of December, in the town of Sharon, Windsor county, State of Vermont . . . My father, Joseph Smith, Sen., left the State of Vermont, and moved to Palmyra, Ontario (now Wayne) county, in the State of New York, when I was in my tenth year, or thereabouts. In about four years after my father's arrival in Palmyra, he moved with his family into Manchester in the same county of Ontario</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.4'>His family consisting of eleven souls, namely, my father, Joseph Smith; my mother, Lucy Smith (whose name, previous to her marriage, was Mack, daughter of Solomon Mack); my brothers, Alvin (who died November 19th, 1823, in the 26th year of his age), Hyrum, myself, Samuel Harrison, William, Don Carlos; and my sisters, Sophronia, Catherine, and Lucy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.5'>Some time in the second year after our removal to Manchester, there was in the place where we lived an unusual excitement on the subject of religion. It commenced with the Methodists, but soon became general among all the sects in that region of country. Indeed, the whole district of country seemed affected by it, and great multitudes united themselves to the different religious parties, which created no small stir and division amongst the people, some crying, "Lo, here!" and others, "Lo, there!" Some were contending for the Methodist faith, some for the Presbyterian, and some for the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.6'>For, notwithstanding the great love which the converts to these different faiths expressed at the time of their conversion, and the great zeal manifested by the respective clergy, who were active in getting up and promoting this extraordinary scene of religious feeling, in order to have everybody converted, as they were pleased to call it, let them join what sect they pleased; yet when the converts began to file off, some to one party and some to another, it was seen that the seemingly good feelings of both the priests and the converts were more pretended than real; for a scene of great confusion and bad feeling ensued priest contending against priest, and convert against convert; so that all their good feelings one for another, if they ever had any, were entirely lost in a strife of words and a contest about opinions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.7'>I was at this time in my fifteenth year. My father's family was proselyted to the Presbyterian faith, and four of them joined that church, namely, my mother, Lucy; my brothers Hyrum and Samuel Harrison; and my sister Sophronia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.8'>During this time of great excitement my mind was called up to serious reflection and great uneasiness; but though my feelings were deep and often poignant, still I kept myself aloof from all these parties, though I attended their several meetings as often as occasion would permit. In process of time my mind became somewhat partial to the Methodist sect, and I felt some desire to be united with them; but so great were the confusion and strife among the different denominations, that it was impossible for a person young as I was, and so unacquainted with men and things, to come to any certain conclusion who was right and who was wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.9'>My mind at times was greatly excited, the cry and tumult were so great and incessant. The Presbyterians were most decided against the Baptists and Methodists, and used all the powers of both reason and sophistry to prove their errors, or, at least, to make the people think they were in error. On the other hand, the Baptists and Methodists in their turn were equally zealous in endeavoring to establish their own tenets and disprove all others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.10'>In the midst of this war of words and tumult of opinions, I often said to myself: What is to be done? Who of all these parties are right; or, are they all wrong together? If any one of them be right, which is it, and how shall I know it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.11'>While I was laboring under the extreme difficulties caused by the contests of these parties of religionists, I was one day reading the Epistle of James, first chapter and fifth verse, which reads: If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.12'>Never did any passage of scripture come with more power to the heart of man than this did at this time to mine. It seemed to enter with great force into every feeling of my heart. I reflected on it again and again, knowing that if any person needed wisdom from God, I did; for how to act I did not know, and unless I could get more wisdom than I then had, I would never know; for the teachers of religion of the different sects understood the same passages of scripture so differently as to destroy all confidence in settling the question by an appeal to the Bible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.13'>At length I came to the conclusion that I must either remain in darkness and confusion, or else I must do as James directs, that is, ask of God. I at length came to the determination to "ask of God," concluding that if he gave wisdom to them that lacked wisdom, and would give liberally, and not upbraid, I might venture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.14'>So, in accordance with this, my determination to ask of God, I retired to the woods to make the attempt. It was on the morning of a beautiful, clear day, early in the spring of eighteen hundred and twenty. It was the first time in my life that I had made such an attempt, for amidst all my anxieties I had never as yet made the attempt to pray vocally.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.15'>After I had retired to the place where I had previously designed to go, having looked around me, and finding myself alone, I kneeled down and began to offer up the desires of my heart to God. I had scarcely done so, when immediately I was seized upon by some power which entirely overcame me, and had such an astonishing influence over me as to bind my tongue so that I could not speak. Thick darkness gathered around me, and it seemed to me for a time as if I were doomed to sudden destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.16'>But, exerting all my powers to call upon God to deliver me out of the power of this enemy which had seized upon me, and at the very moment when I was ready to sink into despair and abandon myself to destruction not to an imaginary ruin, but to the power of some actual being from the unseen world, who had such marvelous power as I had never before felt in any being just at this moment of great alarm, I saw a pillar of light exactly over my head, above the brightness of the sun, which descended gradually until it fell upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.17'>It no sooner appeared than I found myself delivered from the enemy which held me bound. When the light rested upon me I saw two Personages, whose brightness and glory defy all description, standing above me in the air. One of them spake unto me, calling me by name and said, pointing to the other This is My Beloved Son. Hear Him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.18'>My object in going to inquire of the Lord was to know which of all the sects was right, that I might know which to join. No sooner, therefore, did I get possession of myself, so as to be able to speak, than I asked the Personages who stood above me in the light, which of all the sects was right (for at this time it had never entered into my heart that all were wrong) and which I should join.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.19'>I was answered that I must join none of them, for they were all wrong; and the Personage who addressed me said that all their creeds were an abomination in his sight; that those professors were all corrupt; that: "they draw near to me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me, they teach for doctrines the commandments of men, having a form of godliness, but they deny the power thereof."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.20'>He again forbade me to join with any of them; and many other things did he say unto me, which I cannot write at this time. When I came to myself again, I found myself lying on my back, looking up into heaven. When the light had departed, I had no strength; but soon recovering in some degree, I went home. And as I leaned up to the fireplace, mother inquired what the matter was. I replied, "Never mind, all is well I am well enough off." I then said to my mother, "I have learned for myself that Presbyterianism is not true." It seems as though the adversary was aware, at a very early period of my life, that I was destined to prove a disturber and an annoyer of his kingdom; else why should the powers of darkness combine against me? Why the opposition and persecution that arose against me, almost in my infancy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.21'>Some few days after I had this vision, I happened to be in company with one of the Methodist preachers, who was very active in the before mentioned religious excitement; and, conversing with him on the subject of religion, I took occasion to give him an account of the vision which I had had. I was greatly surprised at his behavior; he treated my communication not only lightly, but with great contempt, saying it was all of the devil, that there were no such things as visions or revelations in these days; that all such things had ceased with the apostles, and that there would never be any more of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.22'>I soon found, however, that my telling the story had excited a great deal of prejudice against me among professors of religion, and was the cause of great persecution, which continued to increase; and though I was an obscure boy, only between fourteen and fifteen years of age, and my circumstances in life such as to make a boy of no consequence in the world, yet men of high standing would take notice sufficient to excite the public mind against me, and create a bitter persecution; and this was common among all the sects all united to persecute me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.23'>It caused me serious reflection then, and often has since, how very strange it was that an obscure boy, of a little over fourteen years of age, and one, too, who was doomed to the necessity of obtaining a scanty maintenance by his daily labor, should be thought a character of sufficient importance to attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in a manner to create in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling. But strange or not, so it was, and it was often the cause of great sorrow to myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.24'>However, it was nevertheless a fact that I had beheld a vision. I have thought since, that I felt much like Paul, when he made his defense before King Agrippa, and related the account of the vision he had when he saw a light, and heard a voice; but still there were but few who believed him; some said he was dishonest, others said he was mad; and he was ridiculed and reviled. But all this did not destroy the reality of his vision. He had seen a vision, he knew he had, and all the persecution under heaven could not make it otherwise; and though they should persecute him unto death, yet he knew, and would know to his latest breath, that he had both seen a light and heard a voice speaking unto him, and all the world could not make him think or believe otherwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.25'>So it was with me. I had actually seen a light, and in the midst of that light I saw two Personages, and they did in reality speak to me; and though I was hated and persecuted for saying that I had seen a vision, yet it was true; and while they were persecuting me, reviling me, and speaking all manner of evil against me falsely for so saying, I was led to say in my heart: Why persecute me for telling the truth? I have actually seen a vision; and who am I that I can withstand God, or why does the world think to make me deny what I have actually seen? For I had seen a vision; I knew it, and I knew that God knew it, and I could not deny it, neither dared I do it; at least I knew that by so doing I would offend God, and come under condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.26'>I had now got my mind satisfied so far as the sectarian world was concerned that it was not my duty to join with any of them, but to continue as I was until further directed. I had found the testimony of James to be true that a man who lacked wisdom might ask of God, and obtain, and not be upbraided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.27'>I continued to pursue my common vocations in life until the twenty-first of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-three, all the time suffering severe persecution at the hands of all classes of men, both religious and irreligious, because I continued to affirm that I had seen a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.28'>During the space of time which intervened between the time I had the vision and the year eighteen hundred and twenty-three having been forbidden to join any of the religious sects of the day, and being of very tender years, and persecuted by those who ought to have been my friends and to have treated me kindly, and if they supposed me to be deluded to have endeavored in a proper and affectionate manner to have reclaimed me I was left to all kinds of temptations; and, mingling with all kinds of society, I frequently fell into many foolish errors, and displayed the weakness of youth, and the foibles of human nature; which, I am sorry to say, led me into divers temptations, offensive in the sight of God. In making this confession, no one need suppose me guilty of any great or malignant sins. A disposition to commit such was never in my nature. But I was guilty of levity, and sometimes associated with jovial company, etc., not consistent with that character which ought to be maintained by one who was called of God as I had been. But this will not seem very strange to any one who recollects my youth, and is acquainted with my native cheery temperament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.29'>In consequence of these things, I often felt condemned for my weakness and imperfections; when, on the evening of the above-mentioned twenty-first of September, after I had retired to my bed for the night, I betook myself to prayer and supplication to Almighty God for forgiveness of all my sins and follies, and also for a manifestation to me, that I might know of my state and standing before him; for I had full confidence in obtaining a divine manifestation, as I previously had one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.30'>While I was thus in the act of calling upon God, I discovered a light appearing in my room, which continued to increase until the room was lighter than at noonday, when immediately a personage appeared at my bedside, standing in the air, for his feet did not touch the floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.31'>He had on a loose robe of most exquisite whiteness. It was a whiteness beyond anything earthly I had ever seen; nor do I believe that any earthly thing could be made to appear so exceedingly white and brilliant. His hands were naked, and his arms also, a little above the wrist; so, also, were his feet naked, as were his legs, a little above the ankles. His head and neck were also bare. I could discover that he had no other clothing on but this robe, as it was open, so that I could see into his bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.32'>Not only was his robe exceedingly white, but his whole person was glorious beyond description, and his countenance truly like lightning. The room was exceedingly light, but not so very bright as immediately around his person. When I first looked upon him, I was afraid; but the fear soon left me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.33'>He called me by name, and said unto me that he was a messenger sent from the presence of God to me, and that his name was Moroni; that God had a work for me to do; and that my name should be had for good and evil among all nations, kindreds, and tongues, or that it should be both good and evil spoken of among all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.34'>He said there was a book deposited, written upon gold plates, giving an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang. He also said that the fulness of the everlasting Gospel was contained in it, as delivered by the Savior to the ancient inhabitants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.35'>Also, that there were two stones in silver bows and these stones, fastened to a breastplate, constituted what is called the Urim and Thummim deposited with the plates; and the possession and use of these stones were what constituted "seers" in ancient or former times; and that God had prepared them for the purpose of translating the book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.36'>After telling me these things, he commenced quoting the prophecies of the Old Testament. He first quoted part of the third chapter of Malachi; and he quoted also the fourth or last chapter of the same prophecy, though with a little variation from the way it reads in our Bibles. Instead of quoting the first verse as it reads in our books, he quoted it thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.37'>For behold, the day cometh that shall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly shall burn as stubble; for they that come shall burn them, saith the Lord of Hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor branch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.38'>And again, he quoted the fifth verse thus: Behold, I will reveal unto you the Priesthood, by the hand of Elijah the prophet, before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.39'>He also quoted the next verse differently: And he shall plant in the hearts of the children the promises made to the fathers, and the hearts of the children shall turn to their fathers. If it were not so, the whole earth would be utterly wasted at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.40'>In addition to these, he quoted the eleventh chapter of Isaiah, saying that it was about to be fulfilled. He quoted also the third chapter of Acts, twenty-second and twenty-third verses, precisely as they stand in our New Testament. He said that that prophet was Christ; but the day had not yet come when "they who would not hear his voice should be cut off from among the people," but soon would come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.41'>He also quoted the second chapter of Joel, from the twenty-eighth verse to the last. He also said that this was not yet fulfilled, but was soon to be. And he further stated that the fulness of the Gentiles was soon to come in. He quoted many other passages of scripture, and offered many explanations which cannot be mentioned here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.42'>Again, he told me, that when I got those plates of which he had spoken for the time that they should be obtained was not yet fulfilled I should not show them to any person; neither the breastplate with the Urim and Thummim; only to those to whom I should be commanded to show them; if I did I should be destroyed. While he was conversing with me about the plates, the vision was opened to my mind that I could see the place where the plates were deposited, and that so clearly and distinctly that I knew the place again when I visited it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.43'>After this communication, I saw the light in the room begin to gather immediately around the person of him who had been speaking to me, and it continued to do so until the room was again left dark, except just around him; when, instantly I saw, as it were, a conduit open right up into heaven, and he ascended till he entirely disappeared, and the room was left as it had been before this heavenly light had made its appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.44'>I lay musing on the singularity of the scene, and marveling greatly at what had been told to me by this extraordinary messenger; when, in the midst of my meditation, I suddenly discovered that my room was again beginning to get lighted, and in an instant, as it were, the same heavenly messenger was again by my bedside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.45'>He commenced, and again related the very same things which he had done at his first visit, without the least variation; which having done, he informed me of great judgments which were coming upon the earth, with great desolations by famine, sword, and pestilence; and that these grievous judgments would come on the earth in this generation. Having related these things, he again ascended as he had done before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.46'>By this time, so deep were the impressions made on my mind, that sleep had fled from my eyes, and I lay overwhelmed in astonishment at what I had both seen and heard. But what was my surprise when again I beheld the same messenger at my bedside, and heard him rehearse or repeat over again to me the same things as before; and added a caution to me, telling me that Satan would try to tempt me (in consequence of the indigent circumstances of my father's family), to get the plates for the purpose of getting rich. This he forbade me, saying that I must have no other object in view in getting the plates but to glorify God, and must not be influenced by any other motive than that of building his kingdom; otherwise I could not get them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.47'>After this third visit, he again ascended into heaven as before, and I was again left to ponder on the strangeness of what I had just experienced; when almost immediately after the heavenly messenger had ascended from me for the third time, the cock crowed, and I found that day was approaching, so that our interviews must have occupied the whole of that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.48'>I shortly after arose from my bed, and, as usual, went to the necessary labors of the day; but, in attempting to work as at other times, I found my strength so exhausted as to render me entirely unable. My father, who was laboring along with me, discovered something to be wrong with me, and told me to go home. I started with the intention of going to the house; but, in attempting to cross the fence out of the field where we were, my strength entirely failed me, and I fell helpless on the ground, and for a time was quite unconscious of anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.49'>The first thing that I can recollect was a voice speaking unto me, calling me by name. I looked up, and beheld the same messenger standing over my head, surrounded by light as before. He then again related unto me all that he had related to me the previous night, and commanded me to go to my father and tell him of the vision and commandments which I had received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.50'>I obeyed; I returned to my father in the field, and rehearsed the whole matter to him. He replied to me that it was of God, and told me to go and do as commanded by the messenger. I left the field, and went to the place where the messenger had told me the plates were deposited; and owing to the distinctness of the vision which I had had concerning it, I knew the place the instant that I arrived there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.51'>Convenient to the village of Manchester, Ontario county, New York, stands a hill of considerable size, and the most elevated of any in the neighborhood. On the west side of this hill, not far from the top, under a stone of considerable size, lay the plates, deposited in a stone box. This stone was thick and rounding in the middle on the upper side, and thinner towards the edges, so that the middle part of it was visible above the ground, but the edge all around was covered with earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.52'>Having removed the earth, I obtained a lever, which I got fixed under the edge of the stone, and with a little exertion raised it up. I looked in, and there indeed did I behold the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate, as stated by the messenger. The box in which they lay was formed by laying stones together in some kind of cement. In the bottom of the box were laid two stones crossways of the box, and on these stones lay the plates and the other things with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.53'>I made an attempt to take them out, but was forbidden by the messenger, and was again informed that the time for bringing them forth had not yet arrived, neither would it, until four years from that time; but he told me that I should come to that place precisely in one year from that time, and that he would there meet with me, and that I should continue to do so until the time should come for obtaining the plates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.54'>Accordingly, as I had been commanded, I went at the end of each year, and at each time I found the same messenger there, and received instruction and intelligence from him at each of our interviews, respecting what the Lord was going to do, and how and in what manner his kingdom was to be conducted in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.55'>As my father's worldly circumstances were very limited, we were under the necessity of laboring with our hands, hiring out by day's work and otherwise, as we could get opportunity. Sometimes we were at home, and sometimes abroad, and by continuous labor were enabled to get a comfortable maintenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.56'>In the year 1823 my father's family met with a great affliction by the death of my eldest brother, Alvin. In the month of October, 1825, I hired with an old gentleman by the name of Josiah Stoal, who lived in Chenango county, State of New York. He had heard something of a silver mine having been opened by the Spaniards in Harmony, Susquehanna county, State of Pennsylvania; and had, previous to my hiring to him, been digging, in order, if possible, to discover the mine. After I went to live with him, he took me, with the rest of his hands, to dig for the silver mine, at which I continued to work for nearly a month, without success in our undertaking, and finally I prevailed with the old gentleman to cease digging after it. Hence arose the very prevalent story of my having been a money-digger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.57'>During the time that I was thus employed, I was put to board with a Mr. Isaac Hale, of that place; it was there I first saw my wife (his daughter), Emma Hale. On the 18th of January, 1827, we were married, while I was yet employed in the service of Mr. Stoal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.58'>Owing to my continuing to assert that I had seen a vision, persecution still followed me, and my wife's father's family were very much opposed to our being married. I was, therefore, under the necessity of taking her elsewhere; so we went and were married at the house of Squire Tarbill, in South Bainbridge, Chenango county, New York. Immediately after my marriage, I left Mr. Stoal's, and went to my father's, and farmed with him that season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.59'>At length the time arrived for obtaining the plates, the Urim and Thummim, and the breastplate. On the twenty-second day of September, one thousand eight hundred and twenty-seven, having gone as usual at the end of another year to the place where they were deposited, the same heavenly messenger delivered them up to me with this charge: that I should be responsible for them; that if I should let them go carelessly, or through any neglect of mine, I should be cut off; but that if I would use all my endeavors to preserve them, until he, the messenger, should call for them, they should be protected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.60'>I soon found out the reason why I had received such strict charges to keep them safe, and why it was that the messenger had said that when I had done what was required at my hand, he would call for them. For no sooner was it known that I had them, than the most strenuous exertions were used to get them from me. Every stratagem that could be invented was resorted to for that purpose. The persecution became more bitter and severe than before, and multitudes were on the alert continually to get them from me if possible. But by the wisdom of God, they remained safe in my hands, until I had accomplished by them what was required at my hand. When, according to arrangements, the messenger called for them, I delivered them up to him; and he has them in his charge until this day, being the second day of May, one thousand eight hundred and thirty-eight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.61'>The excitement, however, still continued, and rumor with her thousand tongues was all the time employed in circulating falsehoods about my father's family, and about myself. If I were to relate a thousandth part of them, it would fill up volumes. The persecution, however, became so intolerable that I was under the necessity of leaving Manchester, and going with my wife to Susquehanna county, in the State of Pennsylvania. While preparing to start being very poor, and the persecution so heavy upon us that there was no probability that we would ever be otherwise in the midst of our afflictions we found a friend in a gentleman by the name of Martin Harris, who came to us and gave me fifty dollars to assist us on our journey. Mr. Harris was a resident of Palmyra township, Wayne county, in the State of New York, and a farmer of respectability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.62'>By this timely aid was I enabled to reach the place of my destination in Pennsylvania; and immediately after my arrival there I commenced copying the characters off the plates. I copied a considerable number of them, and by means of the Urim and Thummim I translated some of them, which I did between the time I arrived at the house of my wife's father, in the month of December, and the February following.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.63'>Sometime in this month of February, the aforementioned Mr. Martin Harris came to our place, got the characters which I had drawn off the plates, and started with them to the city of New York. For what took place relative to him and the characters, I refer to his own account of the circumstances, as he related them to me after his return, which was as follows:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.64'>"I went to the city of New York, and presented the characters which had been translated, with the translation thereof, to Professor Charles Anthon, a gentleman celebrated for his literary attainments. Professor Anthon stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian. I then showed him those which were not yet translated, and he said that they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic; and he said they were true characters. He gave me a certificate, certifying to the people of Palmyra that they were true characters, and that the translation of such of them as had been translated was also correct. I took the certificate and put it into my pocket, and was just leaving the house, when Mr. Anthon called me back, and asked me how the young man found out that there were gold plates in the place where he found them. I answered that an angel of God had revealed it unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.65'>"He then said to me, 'Let me see that certificate.' I accordingly took it out of my pocket and gave it to him, when he took it and tore it to pieces, saying that there was no such thing now as ministering of angels, and that if I would bring the plates to him he would translate them. I informed him that part of the plates were sealed, and that I was forbidden to bring them. He replied, 'I cannot read a sealed book.' I left him and went to Dr. Mitchell, who sanctioned what Professor Anthon had said respecting both the characters and the translation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.66'>On the 5th day of April, 1829, Oliver Cowdery came to my house, until which time I had never seen him. He stated to me that having been teaching school in the neighborhood where my father resided, and my father being one of those who sent to the school, he went to board for a season at his house, and while there the family related to him the circumstances of my having received the plates, and accordingly he had come to make inquiries of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.67'>Two days after the arrival of Mr. Cowdery (being the 7th of April) I commenced to translate the Book of Mormon, and he began to write for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.68'>We still continued the work of translation, when, in the ensuing month (May, 1829), we on a certain day went into the woods to pray and inquire of the Lord respecting baptism for the remission of sins, that we found mentioned in the translation of the plates. While we were thus employed, praying and calling upon the Lord, a messenger from heaven descended in a cloud of light, and having laid his hands upon us, he ordained us, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.69'>Upon you my fellow servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer the Priesthood of Aaron, which holds the keys of the ministering of angels, and of the gospel of repentance, and of baptism by immersion for the remission of sins; and this shall never be taken again from the earth until the sons of Levi do offer again an offering unto the Lord in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.70'>He said this Aaronic Priesthood had not the power of laying on hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, but that this should be conferred on us hereafter; and he commanded us to go and be baptized, and gave us directions that I should baptize Oliver Cowdery, and that afterwards he should baptize me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.71'>Accordingly we went and were baptized. I baptized him first, and afterwards he baptized me after which I laid my hands upon his head and ordained him to the Aaronic Priesthood, and afterwards he laid his hands on me and ordained me to the same Priesthood for so we were commanded.*</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.72'>The messenger who visited us on this occasion and conferred this Priesthood upon us, said that his name was John, the same that is called John the Baptist in the New Testament, and that he acted under the direction of Peter, James and John, who held the keys of the Priesthood of Melchizedek, which Priesthood, he said, would in due time be conferred on us, and that I should be called the first Elder of the Church, and he (Oliver Cowdery) the second. It was on the fifteenth day of May, 1829, that we were ordained under the hand of this messenger, and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.73'>Immediately on our coming up out of the water after we had been baptized, we experienced great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner had I baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.74'>Our minds being now enlightened, we began to have the scriptures laid open to our understandings, and the true meaning and intention of their more mysterious passages revealed unto us in a manner which we never could attain to previously, nor ever before had thought of. In the meantime we were forced to keep secret the circumstances of having received the Priesthood and our having been baptized, owing to a spirit of persecution which had already manifested itself in the neighborhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Song.1.75'>We had been threatened with being mobbed, from time to time, and this, too, by professors of religion. And their intentions of mobbing us were only counteracted by the influence of my wife's father's family (under Divine providence), who had become very friendly to me, and who were opposed to mobs, and were willing that I should be allowed to continue the work of translation without interruption; and therefore offered and promised us protection from all unlawful proceedings, as far as in them lay. {Oliver Cowdery describes these events thus: "These were days never to be forgotten to sit under the sound of a voice dictated by the inspiration of heaven, awakened the utmost gratitude of this bosom! Day after day I continued, uninterrupted, to write from his mouth, as he translated with the Urim and Thummim, or, as the Nephites would have said, `Interpreters,' the history or record called `The Book of Mormon.' "To notice, in even few words, the interesting account given by Mormon and his faithful son, Moroni, of a people once beloved and favored of heaven, would supersede my present design; I shall therefore defer this to a future period, and, as I said in the introduction, pass more directly to some few incidents immediately connected with the rise of this Church, which may be entertaining to some thousands who have stepped forward, amid the frowns of bigots and the calumny of hypocrites, and embraced the Gospel of Christ. "No men, in their sober senses, could translate and write the directions given to the Nephites from the mouth of the Savior, of the precise manner in which men should build up His Church, and especially when corruption had spread an uncertainty over all forms and systems practiced among men, without desiring a privilege of showing the willingness of the heart by being buried in the liquid grave, to answer a `good conscience by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.' "After writing the account given of the Savior's ministry to the remnant of the seed of Jacob, upon this continent, it was easy to be seen, as the prophet said it would be, that darkness covered the earth and gross darkness the minds of the people. On reflecting further it was as easy to be seen that amid the great strife and noise concerning religion, none had authority from God to administer the ordinances of the Gospel. For the question might be asked, have men authority to administer in the name of Christ, who deny revelations, when His testimony is no less than the spirit of prophecy, and His religion based, built, and sustained by immediate revelations, in all ages of the world when He has had a people on earth? If these facts were buried, and carefully concealed by men whose craft would have been in danger if once permitted to shine in the faces of men, they were no longer to us; and we only waited for the commandment to be given `Arise and be baptized.' "This was not long desired before it was realized. The Lord, who is rich in mercy, and ever willing to answer the consistent prayer of the humble, after we had called upon Him in a fervent manner, aside from the abodes of men, condescended to manifest to us His will. On a sudden, as from the midst of eternity, the voice of the Redeemer spake peace to us, while the veil was parted and the angel of God came down clothed with glory, and delivered the anxiously looked for message, and the keys of the Gospel of repentance. What joy! what wonder! what amazement! While the world was racked and distracted while millions were groping as the blind for the wall, and while all men were resting upon uncertainty, as a general mass, our eyes beheld, our ears heard, as in the `blaze of day'; yes, more above the glitter of the May sunbeam, which then shed its brilliancy over the face of nature! Then his voice, though mild, pierced to the center, and his words, `I am thy fellow-servant,' dispelled every fear. We listened, we gazed, we admired! 'Twas the voice of an angel from glory, 'twas a message from the Most High! And as we heard we rejoiced, while His love enkindled upon our souls, and we were wrapped in the vision of the Almighty! Where was room for doubt? Nowhere; uncertainty had fled, doubt had sunk no more to rise, while fiction and deception had fled forever! "But, dear brother, think, further think for a moment, what joy filled our hearts, and with what surprise we must have bowed, (for who would not have bowed the knee for such a blessing?) when we received under his hand the Holy Priesthood as he said, `Upon you my fellow-servants, in the name of Messiah, I confer this Priesthood and this authority, which shall remain upon earth, that the Sons of Levi may yet offer an offering unto the Lord in righteousness!' "I shall not attempt to paint to you the feelings of this heart, nor the majestic beauty and glory which surrounded us on this occasion; but you will believe me when I say, that earth, nor men, with the eloquence of time, cannot begin to clothe language in as interesting and sublime a manner as this holy personage. No; nor has this earth power to give the joy, to bestow the peace, or comprehend the wisdom which was contained in each sentence as they were delivered by the power of the Holy Spirit! Man may deceive his fellow-men, deception may follow deception, and the children of the wicked one may have power to seduce the foolish and untaught, till naught but fiction feeds the many, and the fruit of falsehood carries in its current the giddy to the grave; but one touch with the finger of his love, yes, one ray of glory from the upper world, or one word from the mouth of the Savior, from the bosom of eternity, strikes it all into insignificance, and blots it forever from the mind. The assurance that we were in the presence of an angel, the certainty that we heard the voice of Jesus, and the truth unsullied as it flowed from a pure personage, dictated by the will of God, is to me past description, and I shall ever look upon this expression of the Savior's goodness with wonder and thanksgiving while I am permitted to tarry; and in those mansions where perfection dwells and sin never comes, I hope to adore in that day which shall never cease." Messenger and Advocate, vol. 1 (October 1834), pp. 14-16.}</verse>
