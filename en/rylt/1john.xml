      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>That which was from the beginning, that which we have heard, that which we have seen with our eyes, that which we did behold, and our hands did handle, concerning the Word of the Life --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>and the Life was manifested, and we have seen, and do testify, and declare to you the Life, the Age-during, which was with the Father, and was manifested to us --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>that which we have seen and heard declare we to you that you also may have fellowship with us, and our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>and these things we write to you that your joy may be full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>And this is the message that we have heard from Him, and announce to you, that God is light, and darkness in Him is not at all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>if we may say -- 'we have fellowship with Him,' and in the darkness may walk -- we lie, and do not the truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>and if in the light we may walk, as He is in the light -- we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son does cleanse us from every sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>if we may say -- 'we have not sin,' ourselves we lead astray, and the truth is not in us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>if we may confess our sins, steadfast He is and righteous that He may forgive us the sins, and may cleanse us from every unrighteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>if we may say -- 'we have not sinned,' a liar we make Him, and His word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin: and if any one may sin, an advocate we have with the Father, Jesus Christ, a righteous one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>and he -- he is a propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>and in this we know that we have known him, if his commands we may keep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>he who is saying, 'I have known him,' and his command is not keeping, a liar he is, and in him the truth is not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>and whoever may keep his word, truly in him the love of God has been perfected; in this we know that in him we are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He who is saying in him he does remain, ought according as he walked also himself so to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Brethren, a new command I write not to you, but an old command, that you had from the beginning -- the old command is the word that you heard from the beginning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>again, a new command I write to you, which thing is true in him and in you, because the darkness does pass away, and the true light does now shine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>he who is saying, in the light he is, and his brother is hating, in the darkness he is till now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>he who is loving his brother, in the light he does remain, and a stumbling-block in him there is not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>and he who is hating his brother, in the darkness he is, and in the darkness he does walk, and he has not known whither he does go, because the darkness did blind his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I write to you, little children, because the sins have been forgiven you through his name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning; I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil. I write to you, little youths, because you have known the Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I did write to you, fathers, because you have known him who is from the beginning; I did write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God in you does remain, and you have overcome the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Love not you the world, nor the things in the world; if any one does love the world, the love of the Father is not in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>because all that is in the world -- the desire of the flesh, and the desire of the eyes, and the ostentation of the life -- is not of the Father, but of the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>and the world does pass away, and the desire of it, and he who is doing the will of God, he does remain -- to the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little youths, it is the last hour; and even as you heard that the antichrist does come, even now antichrists have become many -- whence we know that it is the last hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>out of us they went forth, but they were not of us, for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but -- that they might be manifested that they are not all of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and have known all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I did not write to you because you have not known the truth, but because you have known it, and because no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is the liar, except he who is denying that Jesus is the Christ? this one is the antichrist who is denying the Father and the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>every one who is denying the Son, neither has he the Father, he who is confessing the Son has the Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>You, then, that which you heard from the beginning, in you let it remain; if in you may remain that which from the beginning you did hear, you also in the Son and in the Father shall remain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>and this is the promise that He did promise us -- the life the age-during.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>These things I did write to you concerning those leading you astray;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>and you, the anointing that you did receive from him, in you it does remain, and you have no need that any one may teach you, but as the same anointing does teach you concerning all, and is true, and is not a lie, and even as was taught you, you shall remain in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, little children, remain in him, that when he may be manifested, we may have boldness, and may not be ashamed before him, in his presence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>if you know that he is righteous, know you that every one doing the righteousness, of him has been begotten.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>See you what love the Father has given to us, that children of God we may be called; because of this the world does not know us, because it did not know Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>beloved, now, children of God are we, and it was not yet manifested what we shall be, and we have known that if he may be manifested, like him we shall be, because we shall see him as he is;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>and every one who is having this hope on him, does purify himself, even as he is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Every one who is doing the sin, the lawlessness also he does do, and the sin is the lawlessness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>and you have known that he was manifested that our sins he may take away, and sin is not in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>every one who is remaining in him does not sin; every one who is sinning, has not seen him, nor known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Little children, let no one lead you astray; he who is doing the righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>he who is doing the sin, of the devil he is, because from the beginning the devil does sin; for this was the Son of God manifested, that he may break up the works of the devil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>every one who has been begotten of God, sin he does not, because his seed in him does remain, and he is not able to sin, because of God he has been begotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>In this manifest are the children of God, and the children of the devil; every one who is not doing righteousness, is not of God, and he who is not loving his brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>because this is the message that you did hear from the beginning, that we may love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>not as Cain -- of the evil one he was, and he did slay his brother, and therefore did he slay him? because his works were evil, and those of his brother righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world does hate you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>we -- we have known that we have passed out of the death to the life, because we love the brethren; he who is not loving the brother does remain in the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Every one who is hating his brother -- a man-killer he is, and you have known that no man-killer has life age-during in him remaining,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>in this we have known the love, because he for us his life did lay down, and we ought for the brethren the lives to lay down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>and whoever may have the goods of the world, and may view his brother having need, and may shut up his compassion from him -- how does the love of God remain in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My little children, may we not love in word nor in tongue, but in word and in truth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>and in this we know that of the truth we are, and before Him we shall assure our hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>because if our heart may condemn -- because greater is God than our heart, and He does know all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart may not condemn us, we have boldness toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>and whatever we may ask, we receive from Him, because His commands we keep, and the things pleasing before Him we do,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>and this is His command, that we may believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ, and may love one another, even as He did give command to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>and he who is keeping His commands, in Him he does remain, and He in him; and in this we know that He does remain in us, from the Spirit that He gave us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, every spirit believe not, but prove the spirits, if of God they are, because many false prophets have gone forth to the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>in this know you the Spirit of God; every spirit that does confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>and every spirit that does not confess Jesus Christ in the flesh having come, of God it is not; and this is that of the antichrist, which you heard that it does come, and now in the world it is already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>You -- of God you are, little children, and you have overcome them; because greater is He who is in you, than he who is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They -- of the world they are; because of this from the world they speak, and the world does hear them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>we -- of God we are; he who is knowing God does hear us; he who is not of God, does not hear us; from this we know the spirit of the truth, and the spirit of the error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, may we love one another, because the love is of God, and every one who is loving, of God he has been begotten, and does know God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>he who is not loving did not know God, because God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>In this was manifested the love of God in us, because His Son -- the only begotten -- has God sent to the world, that we may live through him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>in this is the love, not that we loved God, but that He did love us, and did send His Son a propitiation for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if thus did God love us, we also ought one another to love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>God no one has ever seen; if we may love one another, God in us does remain, and His love is having been perfected in us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>in this we know that in Him we do remain, and He in us, because of His Spirit He has given us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we -- we have seen and do testify, that the Father has sent the Son -- Savior of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>whoever may confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God in him does remain, and he in God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>and we -- we have known and believed the love, that God has in us; God is love, and he who is remaining in the love, in God he does remain, and God in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>In this made perfect has been the love with us, that boldness we may have in the day of the judgment, because even as He is, we -- we also are in this world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>fear is not in the love, but the perfect love does cast out the fear, because the fear has punishment, and he who is fearing has not been made perfect in the love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>we -- we love him, because He -- He first loved us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>if any one may say -- 'I love God,' and his brother he may hate, a liar he is; for he who is not loving his brother whom he has seen, God -- whom he has not seen -- how is he able to love?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>and this is the command we have from Him, that he who is loving God, may also love his brother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Every one who is believing that Jesus is the Christ, of God he has been begotten, and every one who is loving Him who did beget, does love also him who is begotten of Him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>in this we know that we love the children of God, when we may love God, and His commands may keep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>for this is the love of God, that His commands we may keep, and His commands are not burdensome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>because every one who is begotten of God does overcome the world, and this is the victory that did overcome the world -- our faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>who is he who is overcoming the world, if not he who is believing that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This one is he who did come through water and blood -- Jesus the Christ, not in the water only, but in the water and the blood; and the Spirit it is that is testifying, because the Spirit is the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>because three are who are testifying in the heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these -- the three -- are one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>and three are who are testifying in the earth, the Spirit, and the water, and the blood, and the three are into the one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If the testimony of men we receive, the testimony of God is greater, because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He who is believing in the Son of God, has the testimony in himself; he who is not believing God, a liar has made Him, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has testified concerning His Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>and this is the testimony, that life age-during did God give to us, and this -- the life -- is in His Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>he who is having the Son, has the life; he who is not having the Son of God -- the life he has not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>These things I did write to you who are believing in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that life you have age-during, and that you may believe in the name of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And this is the boldness that we have toward Him, that if anything we may ask according to his will, He does hear us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>and if we have known that He does hear us, whatever we may ask, we have known that we have the requests that we have requested from Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If any one may see his brother sinning a sin not unto death, he shall ask, and He shall give to him life to those sinning not unto death; there is sin to death, not concerning it do I speak that he may beseech;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>all unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We have known that every one who has been begotten of God does not sin, but he who was begotten of God does keep himself, and the evil one does not touch him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>we have known that of God we are, and the whole world in the evil does lie;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>and we have known that the Son of God is come, and has given us a mind, that we may know Him who is true, and we are in Him who is true, in His Son Jesus Christ; this one is the true God and the life age-during!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Little children, guard yourselves from the idols! Amen.</verse>
