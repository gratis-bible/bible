In the begynnynge God created heaven and erth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>
The erth was voyde and emptie ad darcknesse was vpon the depe and the spirite of god moved vpon the water
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>
Than God sayd: let there be lyghte and there was lyghte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>
And God sawe the lyghte that it was good: and devyded the lyghte from the darcknesse
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>
and called the lyghte daye and the darcknesse nyghte: and so of the evenynge and mornynge was made the fyrst daye
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>
And God sayd: let there be a fyrmament betwene the waters ad let it devyde the waters a sonder.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>
Than God made the fyrmament and parted the waters which were vnder the fyrmament from the waters that were above the fyrmament: And it was so.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>
And God called the fyrmament heaven And so of the evenynge and morninge was made the seconde daye
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>
And God sayd let the waters that are vnder heaven gather them selves vnto one place that the drye londe may appere: And it came so to passe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>
And god called the drye lande the erth and the gatheringe togyther of waters called he the see. And God sawe that it was good
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>
And God sayd: let the erth bringe forth herbe and grasse that sowe seed and frutefull trees that bere frute every one in his kynde havynge their seed in them selves vpon the erth. And it came so to passe:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>
ad the erth brought forth herbe and grasse sowenge seed every one in his kynde and trees berynge frute and havynge their seed in the selves every one in his kynde. And God sawe that it was good:

and the of the evenynge and mornynge was made the thyrde daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>
Than sayd God: let there be lyghtes in ye firmament of heaven to devyde the daye fro the nyghte that they may be vnto sygnes seasons days and yeares.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>
And let them be lyghtes in the fyrmament of heave to shyne vpon the erth. and so it was.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>
And God made two great lyghtes A greater lyghte to rule the daye and a lesse lyghte to rule the nyghte and he made sterres also.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>
And God put them in the fyrmament of heaven to shyne vpon the erth
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>
and to rule the daye and the nyghte ad to devyde the lyghte from darcknesse. And god sawe yt it was good:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>
and so of the evenynge ad mornynge was made the fourth daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>
And God sayd let the water bryng forth creatures that move and have lyfe and foules for to flee over the erth vnder the fyrmament of heaven.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>
And God created greate whalles and all maner of creatures that lyve and moue which the waters brought forth in their kindes ad all maner of federed foules in their kyndes. And God sawe that it was good:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>
and God blessed them saynge. Growe and multiplye ad fyll the waters of the sees and let the foules multiplye vpo the erth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>
And so of the evenynge and morninge was made the fyfth daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>
And God sayd: leth the erth bring forth lyvynge creatures in thir kyndes: catell and wormes and beastes of the erth in their kyndes and so it came to passe.

</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>
And God sayd: se I have geven yow all herbes that sowe seed which are on all the erth and all maner trees that haue frute in them and sowe seed: to be meate for yow

ad i ye seueth daye god ended hys worke which he had made and rested in ye seventh daye fro all his workes which he had made.

And God blessed ye seventh daye and sanctyfyed it for in it he rested from all his workes which he had created and made.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>
These are the generations of heaven and erth when they were created in the tyme when the LORde God created heaven and erth
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>
and all the shrubbes of the felde be fore they were in the erthe. And all the herbes of the felde before they sprange: for the LORde God had yet sent no rayne vpon the erth nether was there yet any man to tylle the erth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>
But there arose a myste out of the ground and watered all the face of the erth:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>
Then the LORde God shope man even of the moulde of the erth and brethed into his face the breth of lyfe. So man was made a lyvynge soule.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>
The LORde God also planted a garden in Eden from the begynnynge and there he sette man whom he had formed.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>
And the LORde God made to sprynge out of the erth all maner trees bewtyfull to the syghte and pleasant to eate and the tree of lyfe in the middes of the garden: and also the tree of knowlege of good and euell.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>
And there spronge a rever out of Eden to water the garden and thence devided it selfe and grewe in to foure principall waters.
</verse>

The name of the one is Phison he it is that compasseth all the lande of heuila where gold groweth.
</verse>

And the name of the thyrde river is Hidekell which runneth on the easte syde of the assyryans And the fourth river is Euphrates.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>
And the LORde God toke Adam and put him in the garden of Eden to dresse it and to kepe it:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>
and the LORde God comaunded Ada saynge: of all the trees of the garde se thou eate.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>
But of the tre of knowlege of good and badd se that thou eate not: for even ye same daye thou eatest of it thou shalt surely dye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>
And the LORde God sayd: it is not good that man shulde be alone I will make hym an helper to beare him company:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>
And after yt the LORde God had make of the erth all maner beastes of the felde and all maner foules of the ayre he brought them vnto Adam to see what he wold call them. And as Ada called all maner livynge beastes: eve so are their names.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>
And Adam gave names vnto all maner catell and vnto the foules of the ayre and vnto all maner beastes of the felde. But there was no helpe founde vnto Adam to beare him companye
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>
Then the LORde God cast a slomber on Adam and he slepte. And then he toke out one of his rybbes and in stede ther of he fylled vp the place with flesh.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>
And the LORde God made of the rybbe which he toke out of Adam a woma and brought her vnto Adam.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>
Then sayd Ada this is once bone of my boones and flesh of my flesh. This shall be called woman: because she was take of the man.
</verse>

For this cause shall a man leve father and mother and cleve vnto his wyfe and they shall be one flesh.

And the woman sayd vnto the serpent of the frute of the trees in the garden we may eate

Then sayd the serpent vnto the woman: tush ye shall not dye:

And they herd the voyce of the LORde God as he walked in the garde in the coole of the daye. And Adam hyd hymselfe and his wyfe also from the face of the LORde God amonge the trees of the garden.

And Adam answered. The woman which thou gavest to bere me company she toke me of the tree ad I ate.

If Abraham were iustified by dedes the hath he wherin to reioyce: but not with god.

For what sayth the scripture? Abraham beleved god and it was counted vnto him for rightewesnes.

To him that worketh is the rewarde not reckened of favour: but of duty.

For the promes that he shuld be the heyre of the worlde was not geven to Abraha or to his seed thorow the lawe: but thorow ye rightewesnes which cometh of fayth.

For yf they which are of the lawe be heyres then is fayth but vayne and the promes of none effecte.

Therfore by fayth is the inheritauce geven that it myght come of faveour: and the promes myght be sure to all the seed. Not to them only which are of the lawe: but also to them which are of the fayth of Abraham which is the father of vs all.

Not only so but we also ioye in God by the meanes of oure Lorde Iesus Christ by whom we have receavyd the attonment.

But the gyfte is not lyke as the synne. For yf thorow the synne of one many be deed: moche more plenteous vpon many was the grace of God and gyfte by grace: which grace was geven by one man Iesus Christ.

And ye gifte is not over one synne as deeth cam thorow one synne of one yt synned. For damnacion cam of one synne vnto condemnacion: but the gyft cam to iustify fro many synnes.

For they that are carnall are carnally mynded. But they that are spirituall are gostly mynded.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>
To be carnally mynded is deeth. But to be spiritually mynded is lyfe and peace.

Because that the flesshly mynde is emnyte agaynst God: for it is not obedient to the lawe of God nether can be.

The same sprete certifieth oure sprete yt we are the sonnes of God.

But Israel which folowed the lawe of rightewesnes coulde not attayne vnto ye lawe of rightewesnes.

For Christ is the ende of the lawe to iustifie all that beleve.

Moses describeth the rightewesnes which cometh of ye lawe howe that the man which doth the thinges of the lawe shall lyve therin.

For the belefe of the hert iustifieth: and to knowledge with the mouth maketh a man safe.

        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>
Also Titus which was with me though he were a Greke yet was not compelled to be circumcised

        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>
and that because of incomers beynge falce brethren which came in amoge other to spye out oure libertie which we have in Christ Iesus that they might bringe vs into bondage.

        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>
To whom we gave no roume no not for the space of an houre as cocerninge to be brought into subieccio: and that because that the trueth of the gospell myght continue with you.

        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>
for he yt was myghty in Peter in the Apostleshippe over the circumcision the same was myghty in me amoge the gentyls:

        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>
and therfore when they perceaved the grace that was geve vnto me then Iames Cephas and Iohn which semed to be pilers gave to me and Barnabas the ryght hondes and agreed with vs that we shuld preache amonge the Hethen and they amonge the Iewes:

And when Peter was come to Antioche I withstode him in the face for he was worthy to be blamed.

And ye other Iewes dissembled lyke wyse in so moche that Barnabas was brought into their simulacio also.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>
But when I sawe that they went not the ryght waye after the trueth of the gospell I sayde vnto Peter before all men yf thou beynge a Iewe livest after the maner of the gentyls and not as do the Iewes: why causest thou the getyls to live as do the Iewes?

        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>
We which are Iewes by nature and not synners of the getyls

Even as Abraham beleved God and it was asscribed to him for rightewesnes.

So then they which be of fayth are blessed with faythfull Abraham.

For as many as are vnder the dedes of the lawe are vnder malediccio. For it is written: cursed is every man yt cotinueth not in all thinges which are writte in ye boke of ye lawe to fulfill the.

that the blessynge of Abraham might come on the getyls thorow Iesus Christ and that we might receave the promes of the sprete thorow fayth.

To Abraham and his seed were the promises made. He sayth not in the seedes as in many: but in thy sede as in one which is Christ.

This I saye that the lawe which beganne afterwarde beyonde .iiii.C and .xxx. yeares doth not disanull the testament that was confermed afore of God vnto Christ ward to make the promes of none effect.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>
For yf the inheritaunce come of the lawe it cometh not of promes. But God gave it vnto Abraham by promes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>
Wherfore then serveth ye lawe? The lawe was added because of transgression (tyll the seed cam to which ye promes was made) and it was ordeyned by angels in ye honde of a mediator.

A mediator is not a mediator of one. But God is one.

Ys the lawe then agaynst ye promes of God? God forbid. How be it yf ther had bene a lawe geve which coulde have geven lyfe: then no doute rightewesnes shuld have come by ye lawe.
