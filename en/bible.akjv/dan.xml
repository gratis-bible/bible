        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and besieged it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>And the king spoke to Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs, that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of the king' seed, and of the princes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>Children in whom was no blemish, but well favored, and skillful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and understanding science, and such as had ability in them to stand in the king' palace, and whom they might teach the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king' meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>To whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king' meat, nor with the wine which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the eunuchs that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>Now God had brought Daniel into favor and tender love with the prince of the eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>And the prince of the eunuchs said to Daniel, I fear my lord the king, who has appointed your meat and your drink: for why should he see your faces worse liking than the children which are of your sort? then shall you make me endanger my head to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>Prove your servants, I beseech you, ten days; and let them give us vegetables to eat, and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>Then let our countenances be looked on before you, and the countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the king' meat: and as you see, deal with your servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the portion of the king' meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine that they should drink; and gave them vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>And the king communed with them; and among them all was found none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore stood they before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king inquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>And Daniel continued even to the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, with which his spirit was troubled, and his sleep broke from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to show the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king said to them, I have dreamed a dream, and my spirit was troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then spoke the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live for ever: tell your servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone from me: if you will not make known to me the dream, with the interpretation thereof, you shall be cut in pieces, and your houses shall be made a dunghill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>But if you show the dream, and the interpretation thereof, you shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honor: therefore show me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we will show the interpretation of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, I know of certainty that you would gain the time, because you see the thing is gone from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>But if you will not make known to me the dream, there is but one decree for you: for you have prepared lying and corrupt words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore tell me the dream, and I shall know that you can show me the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not a man on the earth that can show the king' matter: therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>And it is a rare thing that the king requires, and there is none other that can show it before the king, except the gods, whose dwelling is not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain; and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the captain of the king' guard, which was gone forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>He answered and said to Arioch the king' captain, Why is the decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing known to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would give him time, and that he would show the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then was the secret revealed to Daniel in a night vision. Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever and ever: for wisdom and might are his:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And he changes the times and the seasons: he removes kings, and sets up kings: he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them that know understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He reveals the deep and secret things: he knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>I thank you, and praise you, O you God of my fathers, who have given me wisdom and might, and have made known to me now what we desired of you: for you have now made known to us the king' matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went in to Arioch, whom the king had ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said thus to him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me in before the king, and I will show to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and said thus to him, I have found a man of the captives of Judah, that will make known to the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, Are you able to make known to me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The secret which the king has demanded cannot the wise men, the astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, show to the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>But there is a God in heaven that reveals secrets, and makes known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the latter days. Your dream, and the visions of your head on your bed, are these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>As for you, O king, your thoughts came into your mind on your bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that reveals secrets makes known to you what shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that you might know the thoughts of your heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>You, O king, saw, and behold a great image. This great image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before you; and the form thereof was terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>This image' head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>You saw till that a stone was cut out without hands, which smote the image on his feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of the summer threshing floors; and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>You, O king, are a king of kings: for the God of heaven has given you a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>And wherever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven has he given into your hand, and has made you ruler over them all. You are this head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And after you shall arise another kingdom inferior to you, and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: for as much as iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things: and as iron that breaks all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And whereas you saw the feet and toes, part of potters'clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, for as much as you saw the iron mixed with miry clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>And whereas you saw iron mixed with miry clay, they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not join one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>For as much as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God has made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter: and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face, and worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an oblation and sweet odors to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered to Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is, that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you could reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon, and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was three score cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>That at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king has set up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>And whoever falls not down and worships shall the same hour be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of music, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Why at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and accused the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They spoke and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>You, O king, have made a decree, that every man that shall hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>And whoever falls not down and worships, that he should be cast into the middle of a burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom you have set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded you: they serve not your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spoke and said to them, Is it true, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not you serve my gods, nor worship the golden image which I have set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all kinds of music, you fall down and worship the image which I have made; well: but if you worship not, you shall be cast the same hour into the middle of a burning fiery furnace; and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer you in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But if not, be it known to you, O king, that we will not serve your gods, nor worship the golden image which you have set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spoke, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore because the king' commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the middle of the burning fiery furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished, and rose up in haste, and spoke, and said to his counsellors, Did not we cast three men bound into the middle of the fire? They answered and said to the king, True, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, See, I see four men loose, walking in the middle of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace, and spoke, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the most high God, come forth, and come here. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth of the middle of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king' counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, on whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell of fire had passed on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Then Nebuchadnezzar spoke, and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who has sent his angel, and delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed the king' word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no other God that can deliver after this sort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all people, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God has worked toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in my house, and flourishing in my palace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts on my bed and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon before me, that they might make known to me the interpretation of the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans, and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but they did not make known to me the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you, and no secret troubles you, tell me the visions of my dream that I have seen, and the interpretation thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>Thus were the visions of my head in my bed; I saw, and behold a tree in the middle of the earth, and the height thereof was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached to heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelled in the boughs thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>I saw in the visions of my head on my bed, and, behold, a watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his branches:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>Let his heart be changed from man', and let a beast' heart be given to him; and let seven times pass over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.17'>This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living may know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will, and sets up over it the basest of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.18'>This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now you, O Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, for as much as all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known to me the interpretation: but you are able; for the spirit of the holy gods is in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.19'>Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonished for one hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spoke, and said, Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation thereof, trouble you. Belteshazzar answered and said, My lord, the dream be to them that hate you, and the interpretation thereof to your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.20'>The tree that you saw, which grew, and was strong, whose height reached to the heaven, and the sight thereof to all the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.21'>Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelled, and on whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their habitation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.22'>It is you, O king, that are grown and become strong: for your greatness is grown, and reaches to heaven, and your dominion to the end of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.23'>And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it; yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass over him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.24'>This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of the most High, which is come on my lord the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.25'>That they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field, and they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and they shall wet you with the dew of heaven, and seven times shall pass over you, till you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.26'>And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree roots; your kingdom shall be sure to you, after that you shall have known that the heavens do rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.27'>Why, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to you, and break off your sins by righteousness, and your iniquities by showing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of your tranquility.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.28'>All this came on the king Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.29'>At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.30'>The king spoke, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majesty?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.31'>While the word was in the king' mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to you it is spoken; The kingdom is departed from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.32'>And they shall drive you from men, and your dwelling shall be with the beasts of the field: they shall make you to eat grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over you, until you know that the most High rules in the kingdom of men, and gives it to whomsoever he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.33'>The same hour was the thing fulfilled on Nebuchadnezzar: and he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown like eagles'feathers, and his nails like birds'claws.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.34'>And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up my eyes to heaven, and my understanding returned to me, and I blessed the most High, and I praised and honored him that lives for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion, and his kingdom is from generation to generation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.35'>And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing: and he does according to his will in the army of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his hand, or say to him, What do you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.36'>At the same time my reason returned to me; and for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned to me; and my counsellors and my lords sought to me; and I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.37'>Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honor the King of heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and those that walk in pride he is able to abase.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.5.12'>For as much as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and understanding, interpreting of dreams, and showing of hard sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be called, and he will show the interpretation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.1'>In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a dream and visions of his head on his bed: then he wrote the dream, and told the sum of the matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.2'>Daniel spoke and said, I saw in my vision by night, and, behold, the four winds of the heaven strove on the great sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.3'>And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>The first was like a lion, and had eagle' wings: I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from the earth, and made stand on the feet as a man, and a man' heart was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus to it, Arise, devour much flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.6'>After this I beheld, and see another, like a leopard, which had on the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also four heads; and dominion was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.7'>After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it had great iron teeth: it devoured and broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.8'>I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them another little horn, before whom there were three of the first horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.9'>I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.10'>A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand thousands ministered to him, and ten thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.11'>I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which the horn spoke: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.12'>As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.13'>I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought him near before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.14'>And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.15'>I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the middle of my body, and the visions of my head troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.16'>I came near to one of them that stood by, and asked him the truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the interpretation of the things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.17'>These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which shall arise out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.18'>But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.19'>Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, broke in pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.20'>And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that spoke very great things, whose look was more stout than his fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.21'>I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and prevailed against them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.22'>Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints possessed the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.23'>Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom on earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and break it in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.24'>And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.25'>And he shall speak great words against the most High, and shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and the dividing of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.26'>But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his dominion, to consume and to destroy it to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.27'>And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.28'>Till now is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in me: but I kept the matter in my heart.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision appeared to me, even to me Daniel, after that which appeared to me at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward; so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according to his will, and became great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen standing before the river, and ran to him in the fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>And I saw him come close to the ram, and he was moved with choler against him, and smote the ram, and broke his two horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him, but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped on him: and there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the pleasant land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and stamped on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>Yes, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of the sanctuary was cast down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the ground; and it practiced, and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said to that certain saint which spoke, How long shall be the vision concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trodden under foot?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'>And he said to me, To two thousand and three hundred days; then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.15'>And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood before me as the appearance of a man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.8.17'>So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid, and fell on my face: but he said to me, Understand, O son of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.18'>Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.19'>And he said, Behold, I will make you know what shall be in the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the end shall be.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.1'>In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the Chaldeans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.2'>In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years in the desolations of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.3'>And I set my face to the Lord God, to seek by prayer and supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.4'>And I prayed to the LORD my God, and made my confession, and said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.5'>We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from your precepts and from your judgments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.6'>Neither have we listened to your servants the prophets, which spoke in your name to our kings, our princes, and our fathers, and to all the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.7'>O LORD, righteousness belongs to you, but to us confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, that are near, and that are far off, through all the countries where you have driven them, because of their trespass that they have trespassed against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.8'>O Lord, to us belongs confusion of face, to our kings, to our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned against you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.11'>Yes, all Israel have transgressed your law, even by departing, that they might not obey your voice; therefore the curse is poured on us, and the oath that is written in the law of Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.12'>And he has confirmed his words, which he spoke against us, and against our judges that judged us, by bringing on us a great evil: for under the whole heaven has not been done as has been done on Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.13'>As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come on us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God, that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand your truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.14'>Therefore has the LORD watched on the evil, and brought it on us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works which he does: for we obeyed not his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.15'>And now, O Lord our God, that have brought your people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and have gotten you renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.16'>O LORD, according to all your righteousness, I beseech you, let your anger and your fury be turned away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain: because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and your people are become a reproach to all that are about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.17'>Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of your servant, and his supplications, and cause your face to shine on your sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.18'>O my God, incline your ear, and hear; open your eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by your name: for we do not present our supplications before you for our righteousnesses, but for your great mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.19'>O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, listen and do; defer not, for your own sake, O my God: for your city and your people are called by your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.20'>And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of my God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.21'>Yes, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel, whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening oblation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.9.24'>Seventy weeks are determined on your people and on your holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.25'>Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem to the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and three score and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.26'>And after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and to the end of the war desolations are determined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.9.27'>And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured on the desolate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.1'>In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed to Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood the thing, and had understanding of the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.2'>In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.3'>I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole weeks were fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.4'>And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.5'>Then I lifted up my eyes, and looked, and behold a certain man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold of Uphaz:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.6'>His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and his arms and his feet like in color to polished brass, and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.7'>And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell on them, so that they fled to hide themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.8'>Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.9'>Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my face toward the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.10'>And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me on my knees and on the palms of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.11'>And he said to me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved, understand the words that I speak to you, and stand upright: for to you am I now sent.  And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.12'>Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I am come for your words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.13'>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.10.16'>And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.10.17'>For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.2'>And now will I show you the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.3'>And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.4'>And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled: for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside those.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.5'>And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.6'>And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king' daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.7'>But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.8'>And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.10'>But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be stirred up, even to his fortress.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.12'>And when he has taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he shall not be strengthened by it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.16'>But he that comes against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.17'>He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do: and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her: but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.18'>After this shall he turn his face to the isles, and shall take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he shall cause it to turn on him.</verse>
