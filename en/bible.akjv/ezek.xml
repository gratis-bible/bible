        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin' captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the middle thereof as the color of amber, out of the middle of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Also out of the middle thereof came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf' foot: and they sparkled like the color of burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went every one straight forward: where the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold one wheel on the earth by the living creatures, with his four faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like to the color of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went on their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rings, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rings were full of eyes round about them four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit was to go, they went, thither was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up over against them: for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And the likeness of the firmament on the heads of the living creature was as the color of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and on the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as the color of amber, as the appearance of fire round about within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of one that spoke.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said to me, Son of man, stand on your feet, and I will speak to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me on my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said to me, Son of man, I send you to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>For they are impudent children and stiff hearted. I do send you to them; and you shall say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns be with you, and you do dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And you shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; Be not you rebellious like that rebellious house: open your mouth, and eat that I give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, see, a roll of a book was therein;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written therein lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat that you find; eat this roll, and go speak to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said to me, Son of man, cause your belly to eat, and fill your bowels with this roll that I give you. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said to me, Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For you are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words you can not understand. Surely, had I sent you to them, they would have listened to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they will not listen to me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made your face strong against their faces, and your forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they be a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go, get you to them of the captivity, to the children of your people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus said the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>I heard also the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels over against them, and a noise of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelled by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there astonished among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have made you a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say to the wicked, You shall surely die; and you give him not warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if you warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, When a righteous man does turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumbling-block before him, he shall die: because you have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also you have delivered your soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of the LORD was there on me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me on my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut yourself within your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But you, O son of man, behold, they shall put bands on you, and shall bind you with them, and you shall not go out among them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will make your tongue sticks to the roof of your mouth, that you shall be dumb, and shall not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; He that hears, let him hear; and he that declines, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>You also, son of man, take you a tile, and lay it before you, and portray on it the city, even Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mount against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>Moreover take you to you an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between you and the city: and set your face against it, and it shall be besieged, and you shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Lie you also on your left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel on it: according to the number of the days that you shall lie on it you shall bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have laid on you the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shall you bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when you have accomplished them, lie again on your right side, and you shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed you each day for a year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>Therefore you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and your arm shall be uncovered, and you shall prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I will lay bands on you, and you shall not turn you from one side to another, till you have ended the days of your siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Take you also to you wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make you bread thereof, according to the number of the days that you shall lie on your side, three hundred and ninety days shall you eat thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And your meat which you shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shall you eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>You shall drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shall you drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And you shall eat it as barley cakes, and you shall bake it with dung that comes out of man, in their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul has not been polluted: for from my youth up even till now have I not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither came there abominable flesh into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then he said to me, See, I have given you cow' dung for man' dung, and you shall prepare your bread therewith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and with astonishment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>That they may want bread and water, and be astonished one with another, and consume away for their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And you, son of man, take you a sharp knife, take you a barber' razor, and cause it to pass on your head and on your beard: then take you balances to weigh, and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>You shall burn with fire a third part in the middle of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and you shall take a third part, and smite about it with a knife: and a third part you shall scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>You shall also take thereof a few in number, and bind them in your skirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>Then take of them again, and cast them into the middle of the fire, and burn them in the fire; for thereof shall a fire come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus said the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the middle of the nations and countries that are round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she has changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are round about her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you multiplied more than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against you, and will execute judgments in the middle of you in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in you that which I have not done, and whereunto I will not do any more the like, because of all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the middle of you, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in you, and the whole remnant of you will I scatter into all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Why, as I live, said the Lord GOD; Surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things, and with all your abominations, therefore will I also diminish you; neither shall my eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of you shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the middle of you: and a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest on them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make you waste, and a reproach among the nations that are round about you, in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an astonishment to the nations that are round about you, when I shall execute judgments in you in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>When I shall send on them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine on you, and will break your staff of bread:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>So will I send on you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave you: and pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword on you. I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>And say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus said the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword on you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your dwelling places the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the middle of you, and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet will I leave a remnant, that you may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when you shall be scattered through the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>And they that escape of you shall remember me among the nations where they shall be carried captives, because I am broken with their whorish heart, which has departed from me, and with their eyes, which go a whoring after their idols: and they shall loathe themselves for the evils which they have committed in all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I am the LORD, and that I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus said the Lord GOD; Smite with your hand, and stamp with your foot, and say, Alas for all the evil abominations of the house of Israel! for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He that is far off shall die of the pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that remains and is besieged shall die by the famine: thus will I accomplish my fury on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>Then shall you know that I am the LORD, when their slain men shall be among their idols round about their altars, on every high hill, in all the tops of the mountains, and under every green tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they did offer sweet smell to all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.14'>So will I stretch out my hand on them, and make the land desolate, yes, more desolate than the wilderness toward Diblath, in all their habitations: and they shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>Also, you son of man, thus said the Lord GOD to the land of Israel; An end, the end is come on the four corners of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.3'>Now is the end come on you, and I will send my anger on you, and will judge you according to your ways, and will recompense on you all your abominations.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the elders of Judah sat before me, that the hand of the Lord GOD fell there on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>Then I beheld, and see a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins even downward, fire; and from his loins even upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the color of amber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>And he put forth the form of an hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem, to the door of the inner gate that looks toward the north; where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision that I saw in the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>Then said he to me, Son of man, lift up your eyes now the way toward the north. So I lifted up my eyes the way toward the north, and behold northward at the gate of the altar this image of jealousy in the entry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>He said furthermore to me, Son of man, see you what they do? even the great abominations that the house of Israel commits here, that I should go far off from my sanctuary? but turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>Then said he to me, Son of man, dig now in the wall: and when I had dig in the wall, behold a door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.9'>And he said to me, Go in, and behold the wicked abominations that they do here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>So I went in and saw; and behold every form of creeping things, and abominable beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel, portrayed on the wall round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>And there stood before them seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and in the middle of them stood Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan, with every man his censer in his hand; and a thick cloud of incense went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>Then said he to me, Son of man, have you seen what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every man in the chambers of his imagery? for they say, the LORD sees us not; the LORD has forsaken the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.13'>He said also to me, Turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations that they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.14'>Then he brought me to the door of the gate of the LORD' house which was toward the north; and, behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.15'>Then said he to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? turn you yet again, and you shall see greater abominations than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>And he brought me into the inner court of the LORD' house, and, behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men, with their backs toward the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east; and they worshipped the sun toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>Then he said to me, Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it a light thing to the house of Judah that they commit the abominations which they commit here? for they have filled the land with violence, and have returned to provoke me to anger: and, see, they put the branch to their nose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>Therefore will I also deal in fury: my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity: and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.1'>He cried also in my ears with a loud voice, saying, Cause them that have charge over the city to draw near, even every man with his destroying weapon in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.2'>And, behold, six men came from the way of the higher gate, which lies toward the north, and every man a slaughter weapon in his hand; and one man among them was clothed with linen, with a writer' inkhorn by his side: and they went in, and stood beside the brazen altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>And the glory of the God of Israel was gone up from the cherub, whereupon he was, to the threshold of the house. And he called to the man clothed with linen, which had the writer' inkhorn by his side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.4'>And the LORD said to him, Go through the middle of the city, through the middle of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads of the men that sigh and that cry for all the abominations that be done in the middle thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>And to the others he said in my hearing, Go you after him through the city, and smite: let not your eye spare, neither have you pity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>Slay utterly old and young, both maids, and little children, and women: but come not near any man on whom is the mark; and begin at my sanctuary. Then they began at the ancient men which were before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>And he said to them, Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain: go you forth. And they went forth, and slew in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>And it came to pass, while they were slaying them, and I was left, that I fell on my face, and cried, and said, Ah Lord GOD! will you destroy all the residue of Israel in your pouring out of your fury on Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>Then said he to me, The iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah is exceeding great, and the land is full of blood, and the city full of perverseness: for they say, The LORD has forsaken the earth, and the LORD sees not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>And as for me also, my eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity, but I will recompense their way on their head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.11'>And, behold, the man clothed with linen, which had the inkhorn by his side, reported the matter, saying, I have done as you have commanded me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.1'>Then I looked, and, behold, in the firmament that was above the head of the cherubim there appeared over them as it were a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.2'>And he spoke to the man clothed with linen, and said, Go in between the wheels, even under the cherub, and fill your hand with coals of fire from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city. And he went in in my sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.3'>Now the cherubim stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.4'>Then the glory of the LORD went up from the cherub, and stood over the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the LORD' glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.5'>And the sound of the cherubims'wings was heard even to the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God when he speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.6'>And it came to pass, that when he had commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the wheels, from between the cherubim; then he went in, and stood beside the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.7'>And one cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took thereof, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.8'>And there appeared in the cherubim the form of a man' hand under their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.9'>And when I looked, behold the four wheels by the cherubim, one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by another cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the color of a beryl stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.10'>And as for their appearances, they four had one likeness, as if a wheel had been in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.11'>When they went, they went on their four sides; they turned not as they went, but to the place where the head looked they followed it; they turned not as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.12'>And their whole body, and their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes round about, even the wheels that they four had.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.14'>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of a cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.4'>O Israel, your prophets are like the foxes in the deserts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.5'>You have not gone up into the gaps, neither made up the hedge for the house of Israel to stand in the battle in the day of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.6'>They have seen vanity and lying divination, saying, The LORD said: and the LORD has not sent them: and they have made others to hope that they would confirm the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.7'>Have you not seen a vain vision, and have you not spoken a lying divination, whereas you say, The LORD said it; albeit I have not spoken?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.8'>Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have spoken vanity, and seen lies, therefore, behold, I am against you, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.9'>And my hand shall be on the prophets that see vanity, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the assembly of my people, neither shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel; and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.10'>Because, even because they have seduced my people, saying, Peace; and there was no peace; and one built up a wall, and, see, others daubed it with untempered mortar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.11'>Say to them which daub it with untempered mortar, that it shall fall: there shall be an overflowing shower; and you, O great hailstones, shall fall; and a stormy wind shall rend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.12'>See, when the wall is fallen, shall it not be said to you, Where is the daubing with which you have daubed it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.13'>Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; I will even rend it with a stormy wind in my fury; and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger, and great hailstones in my fury to consume it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.14'>So will I break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar, and bring it down to the ground, so that the foundation thereof shall be discovered, and it shall fall, and you shall be consumed in the middle thereof: and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.15'>Thus will I accomplish my wrath on the wall, and on them that have daubed it with untempered mortar, and will say to you, The wall is no more, neither they that daubed it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.16'>To wit, the prophets of Israel which prophesy concerning Jerusalem, and which see visions of peace for her, and there is no peace, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.17'>Likewise, you son of man, set your face against the daughters of your people, which prophesy out of their own heart; and prophesy you against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.18'>And say, Thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the women that sew pillows to all armholes, and make kerchiefs on the head of every stature to hunt souls! Will you hunt the souls of my people, and will you save the souls alive that come to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.19'>And will you pollute me among my people for handfuls of barley and for pieces of bread, to slay the souls that should not die, and to save the souls alive that should not live, by your lying to my people that hear your lies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.20'>Why thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against your pillows, with which you there hunt the souls to make them fly, and I will tear them from your arms, and will let the souls go, even the souls that you hunt to make them fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.21'>Your kerchiefs also will I tear, and deliver my people out of your hand, and they shall be no more in your hand to be hunted; and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.22'>Because with lies you have made the heart of the righteous sad, whom I have not made sad; and strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his wicked way, by promising him life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.13.23'>Therefore you shall see no more vanity, nor divine divinations: for I will deliver my people out of your hand: and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.4'>And as for your nativity, in the day you were born your navel was not cut, neither were you washed in water to supple you; you were not salted at all, nor swaddled at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.5'>None eye pitied you, to do any of these to you, to have compassion on you; but you were cast out in the open field, to the loathing of your person, in the day that you were born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.6'>And when I passed by you, and saw you polluted in your own blood, I said to you when you were in your blood, Live; yes, I said to you when you were in your blood, Live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.7'>I have caused you to multiply as the bud of the field, and you have increased and waxen great, and you are come to excellent ornaments: your breasts are fashioned, and your hair is grown, whereas you were naked and bore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.8'>Now when I passed by you, and looked on you, behold, your time was the time of love; and I spread my skirt over you, and covered your nakedness: yes, I swore to you, and entered into a covenant with you, said the Lord GOD, and you became mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.9'>Then washed I you with water; yes, I thoroughly washed away your blood from you, and I anointed you with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.10'>I clothed you also with broidered work, and shod you with badgers'skin, and I girded you about with fine linen, and I covered you with silk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.11'>I decked you also with ornaments, and I put bracelets on your hands, and a chain on your neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.12'>And I put a jewel on your forehead, and earrings in your ears, and a beautiful crown on your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.13'>Thus were you decked with gold and silver; and your raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and broidered work; you did eat fine flour, and honey, and oil: and you were exceeding beautiful, and you did prosper into a kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.14'>And your renown went forth among the heathen for your beauty: for it was perfect through my comeliness, which I had put on you, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.15'>But you did trust in your own beauty, and played the harlot because of your renown, and poured out your fornications on every one that passed by; his it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.16'>And of your garments you did take, and decked your high places with divers colors, and played the harlot thereupon: the like things shall not come, neither shall it be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.17'>You have also taken your fair jewels of my gold and of my silver, which I had given you, and made to yourself images of men, and did commit prostitution with them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.20'>Moreover you have taken your sons and your daughters, whom you have borne to me, and these have you sacrificed to them to be devoured. Is this of your prostitutions a small matter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.21'>That you have slain my children, and delivered them to cause them to pass through the fire for them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.22'>And in all your abominations and your prostitutions you have not remembered the days of your youth, when you were naked and bore, and were polluted in your blood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.30'>How weak is your heart, said the LORD GOD, seeing you do all these things, the work of an imperious whorish woman;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.31'>In that you build your eminent place in the head of every way, and make your high place in every street; and have not been as an harlot, in that you scorn hire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.32'>But as a wife that commits adultery, which takes strangers instead of her husband!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.33'>They give gifts to all whores: but you give your gifts to all your lovers, and hire them, that they may come to you on every side for your prostitution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.34'>And the contrary is in you from other women in your prostitutions, whereas none follows you to commit prostitutions: and in that you give a reward, and no reward is given to you, therefore you are contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.35'>Why, O harlot, hear the word of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.36'>Thus said the Lord GOD; Because your filthiness was poured out, and your nakedness discovered through your prostitutions with your lovers, and with all the idols of your abominations, and by the blood of your children, which you did give to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.37'>Behold, therefore I will gather all your lovers, with whom you have taken pleasure, and all them that you have loved, with all them that you have hated; I will even gather them round about against you, and will discover your nakedness to them, that they may see all your nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.38'>And I will judge you, as women that break wedlock and shed blood are judged; and I will give you blood in fury and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.39'>And I will also give you into their hand, and they shall throw down your eminent place, and shall break down your high places: they shall strip you also of your clothes, and shall take your fair jewels, and leave you naked and bore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.40'>They shall also bring up a company against you, and they shall stone you with stones, and thrust you through with their swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.41'>And they shall burn your houses with fire, and execute judgments on you in the sight of many women: and I will cause you to cease from playing the harlot, and you also shall give no hire any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.42'>So will I make my fury toward you to rest, and my jealousy shall depart from you, and I will be quiet, and will be no more angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.43'>Because you have not remembered the days of your youth, but have fretted me in all these things; behold, therefore I also will recompense your way on your head, said the Lord GOD: and you shall not commit this lewdness above all your abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.44'>Behold, every one that uses proverbs shall use this proverb against you, saying, As is the mother, so is her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.45'>You are your mother' daughter, that lothes her husband and her children; and you are the sister of your sisters, which loathed their husbands and their children: your mother was an Hittite, and your father an Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.46'>And your elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at your left hand: and your younger sister, that dwells at your right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.47'>Yet have you not walked after their ways, nor done after their abominations: but, as if that were a very little thing, you were corrupted more than they in all your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.48'>As I live, said the Lord GOD, Sodom your sister has not done, she nor her daughters, as you have done, you and your daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.49'>Behold, this was the iniquity of your sister Sodom, pride, fullness of bread, and abundance of idleness was in her and in her daughters, neither did she strengthen the hand of the poor and needy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.50'>And they were haughty, and committed abomination before me: therefore I took them away as I saw good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.51'>Neither has Samaria committed half of your sins; but you have multiplied your abominations more than they, and have justified your sisters in all your abominations which you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.52'>You also, which have judged your sisters, bear your own shame for your sins that you have committed more abominable than they: they are more righteous than you: yes, be you confounded also, and bear your shame, in that you have justified your sisters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.53'>When I shall bring again their captivity, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, and the captivity of Samaria and her daughters, then will I bring again the captivity of your captives in the middle of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.54'>That you may bear your own shame, and may be confounded in all that you have done, in that you are a comfort to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.55'>When your sisters, Sodom and her daughters, shall return to their former estate, and Samaria and her daughters shall return to their former estate, then you and your daughters shall return to your former estate.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.58'>You have borne your lewdness and your abominations, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.59'>For thus said the Lord GOD; I will even deal with you as you have done, which have despised the oath in breaking the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.60'>Nevertheless I will remember my covenant with you in the days of your youth, and I will establish to you an everlasting covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.16.61'>Then you shall remember your ways, and be ashamed, when you shall receive your sisters, your elder and your younger: and I will give them to you for daughters, but not by your covenant.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.17.21'>And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword, and they that remain shall be scattered toward all winds: and you shall know that I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.1'>The word of the LORD came to me again, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.3'>As I live, said the Lord GOD, you shall not have occasion any more to use this proverb in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.4'>Behold, all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.5'>But if a man be just, and do that which is lawful and right,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.6'>And has not eaten on the mountains, neither has lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, neither has defiled his neighbor' wife, neither has come near to a menstruous woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.7'>And has not oppressed any, but has restored to the debtor his pledge, has spoiled none by violence, has given his bread to the hungry, and has covered the naked with a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.8'>He that has not given forth on usury, neither has taken any increase, that has withdrawn his hand from iniquity, has executed true judgment between man and man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.9'>Has walked in my statutes, and has kept my judgments, to deal truly; he is just, he shall surely live, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.10'>If he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that does the like to any one of these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.11'>And that does not any of those duties, but even has eaten on the mountains, and defiled his neighbor' wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.12'>Has oppressed the poor and needy, has spoiled by violence, has not restored the pledge, and has lifted up his eyes to the idols, has committed abomination,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.20'>The soul that sins, it shall die. The son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, neither shall the father bear the iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be on him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be on him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.6'>In the day that I lifted up my hand to them, to bring them forth of the land of Egypt into a land that I had espied for them, flowing with milk and honey, which is the glory of all lands:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.8'>But they rebelled against me, and would not listen to me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of their eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: then I said, I will pour out my fury on them, to accomplish my anger against them in the middle of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.9'>But I worked for my name' sake, that it should not be polluted before the heathen, among whom they were, in whose sight I made myself known to them, in bringing them forth out of the land of Egypt.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.23'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.1'>The word of the LORD came again to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.2'>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.3'>And they committed prostitutions in Egypt; they committed prostitutions in their youth: there were their breasts pressed, and there they bruised the teats of their virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.4'>And the names of them were Aholah the elder, and Aholibah her sister: and they were mine, and they bore sons and daughters. Thus were their names; Samaria is Aholah, and Jerusalem Aholibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.5'>And Aholah played the harlot when she was mine; and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians her neighbors,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.6'>Which were clothed with blue, captains and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding on horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>Thus she committed her prostitutions with them, with all them that were the chosen men of Assyria, and with all on whom she doted: with all their idols she defiled herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>Neither left she her prostitutions brought from Egypt: for in her youth they lay with her, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured their prostitution on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Why I have delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, on whom she doted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>These discovered her nakedness: they took her sons and her daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became famous among women; for they had executed judgment on her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.11'>And when her sister Aholibah saw this, she was more corrupt in her inordinate love than she, and in her prostitutions more than her sister in her prostitutions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.12'>She doted on the Assyrians her neighbors, captains and rulers clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding on horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.13'>Then I saw that she was defiled, that they took both one way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>And that she increased her prostitutions: for when she saw men portrayed on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>Girded with girdles on their loins, exceeding in dyed attire on their heads, all of them princes to look to, after the manner of the Babylonians of Chaldea, the land of their nativity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.16'>And as soon as she saw them with her eyes, she doted on them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.17'>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love, and they defiled her with their prostitution, and she was polluted with them, and her mind was alienated from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.18'>So she discovered her prostitutions, and discovered her nakedness: then my mind was alienated from her, like as my mind was alienated from her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.19'>Yet she multiplied her prostitutions, in calling to remembrance the days of her youth, wherein she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.20'>For she doted on their paramours, whose flesh is as the flesh of asses, and whose issue is like the issue of horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.21'>Thus you called to remembrance the lewdness of your youth, in bruising your teats by the Egyptians for the breasts of your youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.22'>Therefore, O Aholibah, thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will raise up your lovers against you, from whom your mind is alienated, and I will bring them against you on every side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.23'>The Babylonians, and all the Chaldeans, Pekod, and Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians with them: all of them desirable young men, captains and rulers, great lords and renowned, all of them riding on horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.24'>And they shall come against you with chariots, wagons, and wheels, and with an assembly of people, which shall set against you buckler and shield and helmet round about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge you according to their judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.25'>And I will set my jealousy against you, and they shall deal furiously with you: they shall take away your nose and your ears; and your remnant shall fall by the sword: they shall take your sons and your daughters; and your residue shall be devoured by the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.26'>They shall also strip you out of your clothes, and take away your fair jewels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.27'>Thus will I make your lewdness to cease from you, and your prostitution brought from the land of Egypt: so that you shall not lift up your eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.28'>For thus said the Lord GOD; Behold, I will deliver you into the hand of them whom you hate, into the hand of them from whom your mind is alienated:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.29'>And they shall deal with you hatefully, and shall take away all your labor, and shall leave you naked and bore: and the nakedness of your prostitutions shall be discovered, both your lewdness and your prostitutions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.30'>I will do these things to you, because you have gone a whoring after the heathen, and because you are polluted with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.31'>You have walked in the way of your sister; therefore will I give her cup into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.32'>Thus said the Lord GOD; You shall drink of your sister' cup deep and large: you shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision; it contains much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.33'>You shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of your sister Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.34'>You shall even drink it and suck it out, and you shall break the shards thereof, and pluck off your own breasts: for I have spoken it, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.35'>Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Because you have forgotten me, and cast me behind your back, therefore bear you also your lewdness and your prostitutions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.36'>The LORD said moreover to me; Son of man, will you judge Aholah and Aholibah? yes, declare to them their abominations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.37'>That they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and with their idols have they committed adultery, and have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass for them through the fire, to devour them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.38'>Moreover this they have done to me: they have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.39'>For when they had slain their children to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it; and, see, thus have they done in the middle of my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.40'>And furthermore, that you have sent for men to come from far, to whom a messenger was sent; and, see, they came: for whom you did wash yourself, painted your eyes, and decked yourself with ornaments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.41'>And sat on a stately bed, and a table prepared before it, whereupon you have set my incense and my oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.42'>And a voice of a multitude being at ease was with her: and with the men of the common sort were brought Sabeans from the wilderness, which put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.43'>Then said I to her that was old in adulteries, Will they now commit prostitutions with her, and she with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.44'>Yet they went in to her, as they go in to a woman that plays the harlot: so went they in to Aholah and to Aholibah, the lewd women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.45'>And the righteous men, they shall judge them after the manner of adulteresses, and after the manner of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.46'>For thus said the Lord GOD; I will bring up a company on them, and will give them to be removed and spoiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.47'>And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.48'>Thus will I cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do after your lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.49'>And they shall recompense your lewdness on you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I am the Lord GOD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.24'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.1'>Again in the ninth year, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.2'>Son of man, write you the name of the day, even of this same day: the king of Babylon set himself against Jerusalem this same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.3'>And utter a parable to the rebellious house, and say to them, Thus said the Lord GOD; Set on a pot, set it on, and also pour water into it:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.5'>Take the choice of the flock, and burn also the bones under it, and make it boil well, and let them seethe the bones of it therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.6'>Why thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose scum is therein, and whose scum is not gone out of it! bring it out piece by piece; let no lot fall on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.7'>For her blood is in the middle of her; she set it on the top of a rock; she poured it not on the ground, to cover it with dust;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.8'>That it might cause fury to come up to take vengeance; I have set her blood on the top of a rock, that it should not be covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.9'>Therefore thus said the Lord GOD; Woe to the bloody city! I will even make the pile for fire great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.10'>Heap on wood, kindle the fire, consume the flesh, and spice it well, and let the bones be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.11'>Then set it empty on the coals thereof, that the brass of it may be hot, and may burn, and that the filthiness of it may be molten in it, that the scum of it may be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.12'>She has wearied herself with lies, and her great scum went not forth out of her: her scum shall be in the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.13'>In your filthiness is lewdness: because I have purged you, and you were not purged, you shall not be purged from your filthiness any more, till I have caused my fury to rest on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.14'>I the LORD have spoken it: it shall come to pass, and I will do it; I will not go back, neither will I spare, neither will I repent; according to your ways, and according to your doings, shall they judge you, said the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.24.15'>Also the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
