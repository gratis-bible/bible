        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover of this disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you go to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore thus said the LORD, You shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die. And Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And when the messengers turned back to him, he said to them, Why are you now turned back?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said to him, There came a man up to meet us, and said to us, Go, turn again to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus said the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that you send to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore you shall not come down from that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said to them, What manner of man was he which came up to meet you, and told you these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a girdle of leather about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke to him, You man of God, the king has said, Come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I be a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty.  And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty.  And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus has the king said, Come down quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I be a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume you and your fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and sought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty your servants, be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he said to him, Thus said the LORD, For as much as you have sent messengers to inquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word? therefore you shall not come down off that bed on which you are gone up, but shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken.  And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said to him, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he said, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Know you that the LORD will take away your master from your head to day? And he answered, Yes, I know it; hold you your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said to him, Tarry, I pray you, here; for the LORD has sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And they two went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided here and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for you, before I be taken away from you. And Elisha said, I pray you, let a double portion of your spirit be on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, You have asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if you see me when I am taken from you, it shall be so to you; but if not, it shall not be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted here and thither: and Elisha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets which were to view at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah does rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said to him, Behold now, there be with your servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray you, and seek your master: lest peradventure the Spirit of the LORD has taken him up, and cast him on some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, You shall not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray you, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees: but the water is naught, and the ground barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein. And they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus said the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, you bald head; go up, you bald head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tare forty and two children of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he worked evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he joined to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, which made Israel to sin; he departed not therefrom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep master, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab has rebelled against me: will you go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go up: I am as you are, my people as your people, and my horses as your horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they fetched a compass of seven days'journey: and there was no water for the host, and for the cattle that followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may inquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel' servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, which poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with you?  get you to the prophets of your father, and to the prophets of your mother.  And the king of Israel said to him, No: for the LORD has called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts lives, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward you, nor see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, Thus said the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus said the LORD, You shall not see wind, neither shall you see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that you may drink, both you, and your cattle, and your beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And you shall smite every fenced city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armor, and upward, and stood in the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose up early in the morning, and the sun shone on the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose up and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth left they the stones thereof; however, the slingers went about it, and smote it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too sore for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through even to the king of Edom: but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his oldest son that should have reigned in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering on the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant did fear the LORD: and the creditor is come to take to him my two sons to be slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for you? tell me, what have you in the house? And she said, Your handmaid has not any thing in the house, save a pot of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>Then he said, Go, borrow you vessels abroad of all your neighbors, even empty vessels; borrow not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And when you are come in, you shall shut the door on you and on your sons, and shall pour out into all those vessels, and you shall set aside that which is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him, and shut the door on her and on her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay your debt, and live you and your children of the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in thither to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, which passes by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us make a little chamber, I pray you, on the wall; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a candlestick: and it shall be, when he comes to us, that he shall turn in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And it fell on a day, that he came thither, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, you have been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for you? would you be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Truly she has no child, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, About this season, according to the time of life, you shall embrace a son. And she said, No, my lord, you man of God, do not lie to your handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the time of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And when the child was grown, it fell on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door on him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray you, one of the young men, and one of the asses, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Why will you go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled an ass, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not your riding for me, except I bid you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Run now, I pray you, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? is it well with your husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is vexed within her: and the LORD has hid it from me, and has not told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>Then she said, Did I desire a son of my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go your way: if you meet any man, salute him not; and if any salute you, answer him not again: and lay my staff on the face of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the child said, As the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, I will not leave you. And he arose, and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>And Gehazi passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the child; but there was neither voice, nor hearing. Why he went again to meet him, and told him, saying, The child is not awaked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And when Elisha was come into the house, behold, the child was dead, and laid on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>He went in therefore, and shut the door on them two, and prayed to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>And he went up, and lay on the child, and put his mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on his hands: and stretched himself on the child; and the flesh of the child waxed warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Then he returned, and walked in the house to and fro; and went up, and stretched himself on him: and the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>And he called Gehazi, and said, Call this Shunammite. So he called her. And when she was come in to him, he said, Take up your son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.2'>And when you come thither, look out there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi, and go in, and make him arise up from among his brothers, and carry him to an inner chamber;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.3'>Then take the box of oil, and pour it on his head, and say, Thus said the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel. Then open the door, and flee, and tarry not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.4'>So the young man, even the young man the prophet, went to Ramothgilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.5'>And when he came, behold, the captains of the host were sitting; and he said, I have an errand to you, O captain. And Jehu said, To which of all us? And he said, To you, O captain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.6'>And he arose, and went into the house; and he poured the oil on his head, and said to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, I have anointed you king over the people of the LORD, even over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.7'>And you shall smite the house of Ahab your master, that I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, and the blood of all the servants of the LORD, at the hand of Jezebel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.8'>For the whole house of Ahab shall perish: and I will cut off from Ahab him that urinates against the wall, and him that is shut up and left in Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.9'>And I will make the house of Ahab like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.10'>And the dogs shall eat Jezebel in the portion of Jezreel, and there shall be none to bury her. And he opened the door, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.11'>Then Jehu came forth to the servants of his lord: and one said to him, Is all well? why came this mad fellow to you? And he said to them, You know the man, and his communication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.12'>And they said, It is false; tell us now. And he said, Thus and thus spoke he to me, saying, Thus said the LORD, I have anointed you king over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.13'>Then they hurried, and took every man his garment, and put it under him on the top of the stairs, and blew with trumpets, saying, Jehu is king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.14'>So Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the son of Nimshi conspired against Joram. (Now Joram had kept Ramothgilead, he and all Israel, because of Hazael king of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.15'>But king Joram was returned to be healed in Jezreel of the wounds which the Syrians had given him, when he fought with Hazael king of Syria.)  And Jehu said, If it be your minds, then let none go forth nor escape out of the city to go to tell it in Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.16'>So Jehu rode in a chariot, and went to Jezreel; for Joram lay there.  And Ahaziah king of Judah was come down to see Joram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.17'>And there stood a watchman on the tower in Jezreel, and he spied the company of Jehu as he came, and said, I see a company. And Joram said, Take an horseman, and send to meet them, and let him say, Is it peace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.18'>So there went one on horseback to meet him, and said, Thus said the king, Is it peace? And Jehu said, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me. And the watchman told, saying, The messenger came to them, but he comes not again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.19'>Then he sent out a second on horseback, which came to them, and said, Thus said the king, Is it peace? And Jehu answered, What have you to do with peace? turn you behind me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.20'>And the watchman told, saying, He came even to them, and comes not again: and the driving is like the driving of Jehu the son of Nimshi; for he drives furiously.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.21'>And Joram said, Make ready. And his chariot was made ready. And Joram king of Israel and Ahaziah king of Judah went out, each in his chariot, and they went out against Jehu, and met him in the portion of Naboth the Jezreelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.22'>And it came to pass, when Joram saw Jehu, that he said, Is it peace, Jehu? And he answered, What peace, so long as the prostitutions of your mother Jezebel and her witchcrafts are so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.23'>And Joram turned his hands, and fled, and said to Ahaziah, There is treachery, O Ahaziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.24'>And Jehu drew a bow with his full strength, and smote Jehoram between his arms, and the arrow went out at his heart, and he sunk down in his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.25'>Then said Jehu to Bidkar his captain, Take up, and cast him in the portion of the field of Naboth the Jezreelite: for remember how that, when I and you rode together after Ahab his father, the LORD laid this burden on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.26'>Surely I have seen yesterday the blood of Naboth, and the blood of his sons, said the LORD; and I will requite you in this plat, said the LORD. Now therefore take and cast him into the plat of ground, according to the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.27'>But when Ahaziah the king of Judah saw this, he fled by the way of the garden house. And Jehu followed after him, and said, Smite him also in the chariot. And they did so at the going up to Gur, which is by Ibleam.  And he fled to Megiddo, and died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.28'>And his servants carried him in a chariot to Jerusalem, and buried him in his sepulcher with his fathers in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.29'>And in the eleventh year of Joram the son of Ahab began Ahaziah to reign over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.30'>And when Jehu was come to Jezreel, Jezebel heard of it; and she painted her face, and tired her head, and looked out at a window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.31'>And as Jehu entered in at the gate, she said, Had Zimri peace, who slew his master?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.32'>And he lifted up his face to the window, and said, Who is on my side?  who? And there looked out to him two or three eunuchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.33'>And he said, Throw her down. So they threw her down: and some of her blood was sprinkled on the wall, and on the horses: and he stepped her under foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.34'>And when he was come in, he did eat and drink, and said, Go, see now this cursed woman, and bury her: for she is a king' daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.35'>And they went to bury her: but they found no more of her than the skull, and the feet, and the palms of her hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.36'>Why they came again, and told him. And he said, This is the word of the LORD, which he spoke by his servant Elijah the Tishbite, saying, In the portion of Jezreel shall dogs eat the flesh of Jezebel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.37'>And the carcass of Jezebel shall be as dung on the face of the field in the portion of Jezreel; so that they shall not say, This is Jezebel.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.1'>And Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. And Jehu wrote letters, and sent to Samaria, to the rulers of Jezreel, to the elders, and to them that brought up Ahab' children, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.2'>Now as soon as this letter comes to you, seeing your master' sons are with you, and there are with you chariots and horses, a fenced city also, and armor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.3'>Look even out the best and meet of your master' sons, and set him on his father' throne, and fight for your master' house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.4'>But they were exceedingly afraid, and said, Behold, two kings stood not before him: how then shall we stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.5'>And he that was over the house, and he that was over the city, the elders also, and the bringers up of the children, sent to Jehu, saying, We are your servants, and will do all that you shall bid us; we will not make any king: do you that which is good in your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.6'>Then he wrote a letter the second time to them, saying, If you be mine, and if you will listen to my voice, take you the heads of the men your master' sons, and come to me to Jezreel by to morrow this time. Now the king' sons, being seventy persons, were with the great men of the city, which brought them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.7'>And it came to pass, when the letter came to them, that they took the king' sons, and slew seventy persons, and put their heads in baskets, and sent him them to Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.8'>And there came a messenger, and told him, saying, They have brought the heads of the king' sons. And he said, Lay you them in two heaps at the entering in of the gate until the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.9'>And it came to pass in the morning, that he went out, and stood, and said to all the people, You be righteous: behold, I conspired against my master, and slew him: but who slew all these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.10'>Know now that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the LORD, which the LORD spoke concerning the house of Ahab: for the LORD has done that which he spoke by his servant Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.11'>So Jehu slew all that remained of the house of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his great men, and his kinfolks, and his priests, until he left him none remaining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.12'>And he arose and departed, and came to Samaria. And as he was at the shearing house in the way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.13'>Jehu met with the brothers of Ahaziah king of Judah, and said, Who are you? And they answered, We are the brothers of Ahaziah; and we go down to salute the children of the king and the children of the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.14'>And he said, Take them alive. And they took them alive, and slew them at the pit of the shearing house, even two and forty men; neither left he any of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.15'>And when he was departed there, he lighted on Jehonadab the son of Rechab coming to meet him: and he saluted him, and said to him, Is your heart right, as my heart is with your heart? And Jehonadab answered, It is. If it be, give me your hand. And he gave him his hand; and he took him up to him into the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.16'>And he said, Come with me, and see my zeal for the LORD. So they made him ride in his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.17'>And when he came to Samaria, he slew all that remained to Ahab in Samaria, till he had destroyed him, according to the saying of the LORD, which he spoke to Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.18'>And Jehu gathered all the people together, and said to them, Ahab served Baal a little; but Jehu shall serve him much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.19'>Now therefore call to me all the prophets of Baal, all his servants, and all his priests; let none be wanting: for I have a great sacrifice to do to Baal; whoever shall be wanting, he shall not live. But Jehu did it in subtlety, to the intent that he might destroy the worshippers of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.20'>And Jehu said, Proclaim a solemn assembly for Baal. And they proclaimed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.21'>And Jehu sent through all Israel: and all the worshippers of Baal came, so that there was not a man left that came not. And they came into the house of Baal; and the house of Baal was full from one end to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.22'>And he said to him that was over the vestry, Bring forth vestments for all the worshippers of Baal. And he brought them forth vestments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.23'>And Jehu went, and Jehonadab the son of Rechab, into the house of Baal, and said to the worshippers of Baal, Search, and look that there be here with you none of the servants of the LORD, but the worshippers of Baal only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.24'>And when they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings, Jehu appointed fourscore men without, and said, If any of the men whom I have brought into your hands escape, he that lets him go, his life shall be for the life of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.25'>And it came to pass, as soon as he had made an end of offering the burnt offering, that Jehu said to the guard and to the captains, Go in, and slay them; let none come forth. And they smote them with the edge of the sword; and the guard and the captains cast them out, and went to the city of the house of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.26'>And they brought forth the images out of the house of Baal, and burned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.27'>And they broke down the image of Baal, and broke down the house of Baal, and made it a draught house to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.28'>Thus Jehu destroyed Baal out of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.29'>However, from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, Jehu departed not from after them, to wit, the golden calves that were in Bethel, and that were in Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.30'>And the LORD said to Jehu, Because you have done well in executing that which is right in my eyes, and have done to the house of Ahab according to all that was in my heart, your children of the fourth generation shall sit on the throne of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.31'>But Jehu took no heed to walk in the law of the LORD God of Israel with all his heart: for he departed not from the sins of Jeroboam, which made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.32'>In those days the LORD began to cut Israel short: and Hazael smote them in all the coasts of Israel;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.2'>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, after the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD cast out before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.3'>For he built up again the high places which Hezekiah his father had destroyed; and he reared up altars for Baal, and made a grove, as did Ahab king of Israel; and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.4'>And he built altars in the house of the LORD, of which the LORD said, In Jerusalem will I put my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.5'>And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two courts of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.6'>And he made his son pass through the fire, and observed times, and used enchantments, and dealt with familiar spirits and wizards: he worked much wickedness in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.7'>And he set a graven image of the grove that he had made in the house, of which the LORD said to David, and to Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.8'>Neither will I make the feet of Israel move any more out of the land which I gave their fathers; only if they will observe to do according to all that I have commanded them, and according to all the law that my servant Moses commanded them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.9'>But they listened not: and Manasseh seduced them to do more evil than did the nations whom the LORD destroyed before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.10'>And the LORD spoke by his servants the prophets, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.11'>Because Manasseh king of Judah has done these abominations, and has done wickedly above all that the Amorites did, which were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.12'>Therefore thus said the LORD God of Israel, Behold, I am bringing such evil on Jerusalem and Judah, that whoever hears of it, both his ears shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.13'>And I will stretch over Jerusalem the line of Samaria, and the plummet of the house of Ahab: and I will wipe Jerusalem as a man wipes a dish, wiping it, and turning it upside down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.14'>And I will forsake the remnant of my inheritance, and deliver them into the hand of their enemies; and they shall become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.15'>Because they have done that which was evil in my sight, and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came forth out of Egypt, even to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.16'>Moreover Manasseh shed innocent blood very much, till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another; beside his sin with which he made Judah to sin, in doing that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.17'>Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and all that he did, and his sin that he sinned, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.18'>And Manasseh slept with his fathers, and was buried in the garden of his own house, in the garden of Uzza: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.19'>Amon was twenty and two years old when he began to reign, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. And his mother' name was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.20'>And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as his father Manasseh did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.21'>And he walked in all the way that his father walked in, and served the idols that his father served, and worshipped them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.22'>And he forsook the LORD God of his fathers, and walked not in the way of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.23'>And the servants of Amon conspired against him, and slew the king in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.24'>And the people of the land slew all them that had conspired against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his son king in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.25'>Now the rest of the acts of Amon which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.26'>And he was buried in his sepulcher in the garden of Uzza: and Josiah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.1'>Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty and one years in Jerusalem. And his mother' name was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.2'>And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and walked in all the way of David his father, and turned not aside to the right hand or to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.3'>And it came to pass in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, that the king sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, the son of Meshullam, the scribe, to the house of the LORD, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.4'>Go up to Hilkiah the high priest, that he may sum the silver which is brought into the house of the LORD, which the keepers of the door have gathered of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.5'>And let them deliver it into the hand of the doers of the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD: and let them give it to the doers of the work which is in the house of the LORD, to repair the breaches of the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.6'>To carpenters, and builders, and masons, and to buy timber and hewn stone to repair the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.7'>However, there was no reckoning made with them of the money that was delivered into their hand, because they dealt faithfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.8'>And Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the scribe, I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he read it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.9'>And Shaphan the scribe came to the king, and brought the king word again, and said, Your servants have gathered the money that was found in the house, and have delivered it into the hand of them that do the work, that have the oversight of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.10'>And Shaphan the scribe showed the king, saying, Hilkiah the priest has delivered me a book. And Shaphan read it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.11'>And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the book of the law, that he rent his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.12'>And the king commanded Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Achbor the son of Michaiah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asahiah a servant of the king', saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.13'>Go you, inquire of the LORD for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that is found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not listened to the words of this book, to do according to all that which is written concerning us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.14'>So Hilkiah the priest, and Ahikam, and Achbor, and Shaphan, and Asahiah, went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvah, the son of Harhas, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelled in Jerusalem in the college;) and they communed with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.15'>And she said to them, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, Tell the man that sent you to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.16'>Thus said the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil on this place, and on the inhabitants thereof, even all the words of the book which the king of Judah has read:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.17'>Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be kindled against this place, and shall not be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.18'>But to the king of Judah which sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus said the LORD God of Israel, As touching the words which you have heard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.19'>Because your heart was tender, and you have humbled yourself before the LORD, when you heard what I spoke against this place, and against the inhabitants thereof, that they should become a desolation and a curse, and have rent your clothes, and wept before me; I also have heard you, said the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.20'>Behold therefore, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered into your grave in peace; and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring on this place. And they brought the king word again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.4'>And the king commanded Hilkiah the high priest, and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the door, to bring forth out of the temple of the LORD all the vessels that were made for Baal, and for the grove, and for all the host of heaven: and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron, and carried the ashes of them to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.5'>And he put down the idolatrous priests, whom the kings of Judah had ordained to burn incense in the high places in the cities of Judah, and in the places round about Jerusalem; them also that burned incense to Baal, to the sun, and to the moon, and to the planets, and to all the host of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.6'>And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD, without Jerusalem, to the brook Kidron, and burned it at the brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the powder thereof on the graves of the children of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.7'>And he broke down the houses of the sodomites, that were by the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the grove.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.9'>Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the unleavened bread among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.10'>And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to pass through the fire to Molech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.11'>And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.12'>And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD, did the king beat down, and broke them down from there, and cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.13'>And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the king of Israel had built for Ashtoreth the abomination of the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of Ammon, did the king defile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.14'>And he broke in pieces the images, and cut down the groves, and filled their places with the bones of men.</verse>
