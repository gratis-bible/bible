        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.2'>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones, and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.3'>Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my God, I have of my own proper good, of gold and silver, which I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.4'>Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls of the houses with:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.5'>The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service this day to the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.6'>Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers of the king' work, offered willingly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.7'>And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and one hundred thousand talents of iron.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.9'>Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly, because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.10'>Why David blessed the LORD before all the congregation: and David said, Blessed be you, LORD God of Israel our father, for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.11'>Yours, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is yours; your is the kingdom, O LORD, and you are exalted as head above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.12'>Both riches and honor come of you, and you reign over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.13'>Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.14'>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.15'>For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as were all our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is none abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.16'>O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you an house for your holy name comes of your hand, and is all your own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.17'>I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, which are present here, to offer willingly to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.18'>O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.19'>And give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have made provision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.20'>And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the LORD, and the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.21'>And they sacrificed sacrifices to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings to the LORD, on the morrow after that day, even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.22'>And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to the LORD to be the chief governor, and Zadok to be priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.23'>Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.24'>And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.25'>And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.26'>Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.27'>And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years reigned he in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.28'>And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.29'>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.30'>With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</verse>
