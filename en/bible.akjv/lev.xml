        <description>This is a new translation of the Bible, based on the original King James Version. It is a simple word for word update from the King James English. I have taken care to change nothing doctrinally, but to simply update the spelling and vocabulary. I have not changed the grammar because that could alter the doctrine.</description>

        <verse osisID='Lev.26.33'>And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your cities waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.34'>Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lies desolate, and you be in your enemies'land; even then shall the land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.35'>As long as it lies desolate it shall rest; because it did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelled on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.36'>And on them that are left alive of you I will send a faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none pursues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.37'>And they shall fall one on another, as it were before a sword, when none pursues: and you shall have no power to stand before your enemies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.26.39'>And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies'lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.40'>If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.41'>And that I also have walked contrary to them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.42'>Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.43'>The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lies desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.44'>And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I am the LORD their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.45'>But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.26.46'>These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.27'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.1'>And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.2'>Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the LORD by your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.3'>And your estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even to sixty years old, even your estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.7'>And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male, then your estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.8'>But if he be poorer than your estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.9'>And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering to the LORD, all that any man gives of such to the LORD shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.10'>He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.11'>And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice to the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.12'>And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as you value it, who are the priest, so shall it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.13'>But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth part thereof to your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.14'>And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy to the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>And if a man shall sanctify to the LORD some part of a field of his possession, then your estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to your estimation it shall stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon to him the money according to the years that remain, even to the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of your estimation to it, and it shall be assured to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>But the field, when it goes out in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest'.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>And if a man sanctify to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>Then the priest shall reckon to him the worth of your estimation, even to the year of the jubilee: and he shall give your estimation in that day, as a holy thing to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of the jubilee the field shall return to him of whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the land did belong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>And all your estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD' firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or sheep: it is the LORD'.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to your estimation, and shall add a fifth part of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to your estimation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote to the LORD of all that he has, both of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.29'>None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.30'>And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD': it is holy to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.31'>And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth part thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of whatever passes under the rod, the tenth shall be holy to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.</verse>
