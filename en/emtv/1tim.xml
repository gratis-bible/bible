        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='1Tim'>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ, according to [the] commandment of God our Savior and [the] Lord Jesus Christ, our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>To Timothy, [my ]own son in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God our Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>Just as I urged you to remain in Ephesus as I traveled into Macedonia, that you should command certain [people] not to teach differently,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>nor to pay attention to myths and endless genealogies, which cause disputes rather than godly edification which is in faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>Now the goal of the commandment is love out of a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from sincere faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>from which some, having strayed, have turned aside to futile talk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be teachers of the law, not understanding either what they say or what they affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the law is good if one uses it lawfully,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>knowing this: that the law is not laid down for the righteous, but for the lawless and insubordinate, for the ungodly and for sinners, for unholy and profane, for killers of fathers and killers of mothers, for murderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>for fornicators, for sodomites, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and if there is any other thing that is opposed to sound doctrine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>according to the gospel of the glory of the blessed God, [with] which I was entrusted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>And I give thanks to the [One] who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, because He considered me faithful, putting me into the ministry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>I, who was formerly a blasphemer, a persecutor, and an insolent man; but I was shown mercy, because, being ignorant, I did it in unbelief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>and the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>Faithful is this word, and worthy of all acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>However, because of this I was shown mercy, so that in me first Jesus Christ might show forth all longsuffering, as a pattern for those who are going to believe on Him for everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King of the Ages, immortal, invisible, [the] only wise God, [be] honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>This charge I commit to you, [my] son Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that you may war by them the good warfare,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>having faith and a good conscience, which some having rejected, concerning the faith have suffered shipwreck,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan so that they may be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>Therefore I exhort first of all that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>on behalf of kings and all those who are in authority, that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>For this is good and acceptable before God our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>who desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men, the Man Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>who gave Himself a ransom for all, the testimony in due time;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>for which I was appointed a herald and apostle-I speak the truth in Christ, I do not lie-a teacher of Gentiles in faith and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I desire therefore that men pray in every place, lifting up holy hands, without wrath and doubting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>Likewise also that the women adorn themselves in modest apparel, with propriety and discretion, not with braids or gold or pearls or expensive clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but which is fitting for women professing godliness, by means of good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in silence with all submission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>And I do not permit a woman to teach, nor to have authority over a man, but to be in silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>For Adam first was formed, then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived, has come to be in transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>Nevertheless she shall be saved through childbirth, if they remain in faith and love, and sanctification, with self-control.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>Faithful is this word: If anyone aspires to the position of a bishop, he desires a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>It is necessary, therefore, for a bishop to be irreproachable, the husband of one wife, temperate, sober-minded, well-behaved, hospitable, skillful at teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>not given to wine, not a bully, not greedy for money, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not loving money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>one ruling his own house well, having [his] children in submission with all reverence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>(for if one does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the church of God?);</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>not a new convert, lest being puffed up [with pride] he fall into the [same] condemnation as the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>Moreover he must have a good testimony among those outside, lest he fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Likewise deacons must be reverent, not double-tongued, not being given to much wine, not greedy for money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>holding the mystery of the faith with a pure conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>But let these also first be tested; then let them serve as deacons, being irreproachable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Likewise their wives must be reverent, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let deacons be the husbands of one wife, ruling their children well, and their own houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For those who have served well as deacons obtain a standing for themselves and much boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>These things I write to you, hoping to come to you shortly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>but if I am delayed, [I write] so that you may know how it is necessary to conduct oneself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and bulwark of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>And confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: God was manifested in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among [the ]Gentiles, believed on in the world, [and ]was received up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>But the Spirit explicitly says, that in latter times some shall fall away from the faith, giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>speaking lies in hypocrisy, having been seared with a hot iron [as to ]their own conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>forbidding to marry, [commanding] to abstain from foods which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who are believers and have come to know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>Because every creature of God is good, and not one is to be rejected, being received with thanksgiving,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>for it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>Instructing the brothers in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, being nourished by the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>But reject profane and old wives' tales, and exercise yourself unto godliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>For bodily exercise is profitable a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the present life and of the coming life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>Trustworthy is this word and worthy of all acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>For to this end we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>These things command and teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no one look down on your youthfulness, but [rather ]become a pattern for the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in spirit, in faith, in purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Until I come, give attention to [public] reading, to exhortation, to doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Meditate on these things; be in these things[, ]so that your progress may be evident to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Take heed to yourself and to the doctrine. Continue in them, for by doing this you will save both yourself and those who hear you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but [rather ]exhort him as a father, younger men as brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, with all purity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows who are really widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if a certain widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show piety to their own household and to make repayment to their parents; for this is acceptable before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she who is really a widow and having been left alone, has set her hope on God, and continues in supplications and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she who is living for pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>And these things command, so that they may be blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>But if anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his [own] house, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let a widow be enrolled having become not less than sixty years, [the] wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>having a reputation for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has lodged strangers, if she has washed the saints' feet, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>But refuse [to enroll] the younger widows; for whenever they grow lustful against Christ, they desire to marry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>having condemnation because they have set aside their first faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>And besides they learn to be idle, going around from house to house, and not only idle but also gossipy and busybodies, speaking things [which are] not proper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>Therefore I desire that the younger widows to marry, to bear children, to manage the house, to give no opportunity to the adversary because of reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>For already some have turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any believing man or believing woman has widows, let [that one] relieve them, and do not let the church be burdened, that it may relieve those who are really widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders having ruled well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox threshing [grain],"and, "The worker is worthy of his wages."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Do not receive an accusation against an elder unless on [the basis of] two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Those who are sinning rebuke before all, that the rest also may have fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect angels that you observe these things without prejudice, doing nothing according to partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Lay hands on no one hastily, nor share in [the] sins of others; keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>No longer drink water [only], but use a little wine on account of your stomach, and your frequent illnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>The sins of some men are evident beforehand, preceding them to judgment, but some also follow after.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>Likewise also the good works [of some] are evident beforehand, and those which are otherwise cannot be hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many as are slaves under a yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and His doctrine may not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>And those having believing masters, let them not despise them because they are brothers, but rather let them serve as slaves, because those receiving the good service are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If anyone teaches differently and does not consent to sound words, even those of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine which accords with godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is puffed up, understanding nothing, but [is] morbidly concerned with disputes and word battles, from which come envy, strife, slanders, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>constant wranglings of men of corrupt minds and having been deprived of the truth, supposing that godliness is a means of profit. Withdraw from such [people].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>But godliness with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain that neither can we carry anything out!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>But having food and clothing, with these things we shall be content.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>But those desiring to be rich fall into temptation and a snare, and many senseless and harmful lusts which sink men into destruction and perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is[ the] root of all evil, of which some [by] aspiring have strayed away from the faith in their greediness, and pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>You however, O man of God, flee these things. But pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, gentleness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of faith, lay hold of eternal life, to which you were called and have confessed the good confession before many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge you before God who gives life to all things, and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>that you keep this commandment without spot, blameless until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>which He will show in His own time, He who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>who alone has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light, whom no man has seen or is able to see, to whom be honor and everlasting power. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Command those who are rich in this present age not to be haughty, nor to put their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but in the living God, who provides all things richly for us to enjoy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous, sharing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>storing up for yourselves a good foundation for the future, that they may lay hold of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy! Guard that which was committed to your trust, turning away from the profane and empty babblings and opposing views of what is falsely called "knowledge,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>which some, by professing [expertise,] missed the mark concerning the faith. Grace be with you. Amen.</verse>
