        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to Him to show His servants the[ ]things which must come to pass quickly. And He made it known by sending it through His angel to His servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified to the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things as He saw, both the things that are and those that must happen after these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of this prophecy, and who keep the things having been written in it; for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John, to the seven churches [which are] in Asia: Grace to you and peace from Him who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven-fold Spirit who is before His throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To Him who loves us and who washed us from our sins in His own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and He made us kings and priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, He is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see Him, and those who pierced Him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail because of Him. Even so, Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>"I am the Alpha and the Omega,"says the Lord God, "He who is and He who was and He who is to come, The Almighty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, your brother and partaker in the tribulation and kingdom and endurance in Christ Jesus, came to be on the island that is called Patmos on account of the word of God and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in [the ]Spirit on the Lord's Day, and I heard a loud voice like a trumpet behind me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, "That which you see, write in a book and send to the seven churches: to Ephesus, to Smyrna, to Pergamos, to Thyatira, to Sardis, to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And there I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the midst of the seven lampstands [stood One] like [the] Son of Man, having been clothed in a [robe] reaching to [His] feet and having been girded across [His] chest with a golden belt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>And His head and His hair were white, and like white wool, like snow, and His eyes [were ]like a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>And His feet were like fine brass, as if refined in a furnace, and His voice as the sound of many waters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>He had in His right hand seven stars, out of His mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword, and His countenance was as the sun shining in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw Him, I fell at His feet as [if] dead. But He put His right hand on me, saying, "Do not fear; I am the First and the Last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>I am He who lives, and became dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. Amen. And I have the keys of Death and of Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write therefore the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things which shall be hereafter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars which you saw in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands which you saw are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>"To the angel of the church of Ephesus write, 'These things says He that holds the seven stars in His right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>"I know your works, and your labor, and your endurance, and that you cannot bear those who are evil. And you tested those who say that they are apostles and they are not, and you found them [to be ]liars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>and you have endurance and you have born patiently on account of My name, and you did not become weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>Nevertheless I have this against you, that you have left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; but if not, I am coming to you quickly and I will remove your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him that overcomes will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of My God."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>"And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write, 'These things says the First and the Last, who became dead, and came to life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>"I know your works, and your tribulation, and your poverty (but you are rich); and I know the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews and are not, but [are] a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear none of those things which you are about to suffer. Behold indeed, the devil is about to cast [some] of you into prison, so that you may be tested, and you will have tribulation ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes shall in no way be harmed by the second death."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>"And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write, 'These things says He who has the sharp two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>"I know your works, and where you live, where Satan's throne is. And you hold fast to My name, and did not deny My faith in the days in which Antipas was My faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan is dwelling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you, because you have there [some] who hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, both to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>Thus you also have those who hold the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, [which ]likewise[ I hate.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent therefore! Or else I will come to you quickly, and make war against them with the sword of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give to him some of the hidden manna to eat. And I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written which no one knows except he who receives it."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>"And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write, 'These things says the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and His feet like fine brass:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>"I know your works, and love, and faith and service, and your endurance; and your last works [are] greater than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have [this] against you, that you tolerate your wife Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce My servants to commit fornication and eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time so that she might repent, and she does not wish to repent of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I am casting her into a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, if they do not repent of her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>I will kill her children by death, and all the churches shall know that I am He who searches minds and hearts. And I will give to each one of you according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as do not have this doctrine, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I will put on you no other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>Only hold fast what you have till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he who overcomes, and he who keeps My works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>'And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; they shall be smashed to pieces like clay vessels'-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>as I also have received from My Father; and I will give him the morning star.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>"And to the angel of the church in Sardis write, 'These things says He that has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: "I know your works, that you have a name, that you live, and you are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be watchful, and keep that which remains, which you were about to cast out, for I have not found your works perfect before My God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how you have received and heard, and hold fast, and repent. Therefore if you will not watch, I will come upon you like a thief, and by no means shall you know what hour I will come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>You have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments; and they will walk with Me in white, because they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who overcomes shall be clothed in white garments, and by no means shall I erase his name from the Book of Life; but I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>"And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write, 'These things says the Holy [One], the True [One,] "He who has the key of David, He that opens and no man shuts, except He that opens, and no man shall open."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>"I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, and no man can shut it; because you have a little strength and have kept My word, and you have not denied My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I will give those of the synagogue of Satan, those who say they are Jews and are not, but they are lying-behold, I will compel them to come and bow down at your feet, and they shall know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept My command to persevere, I also will keep you from the hour of testing which is about to come upon the whole world, to test those that dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I am coming quickly! Hold fast what you have, that no man may take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and by no means shall he go out any longer. And I will write on him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from heaven from My God. And My new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>"And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write, 'These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the beginning of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>"I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish [that] you were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>Therefore, since you are lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spew you out of My mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you say, 'I am wealthy, and have become rich, and have need of nothing'-and do not know that you are wretched, miserable, poor, blind, and naked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel you to buy from Me gold having been tried by fire, so that you may become rich; and white robes, so that you may be clothed, and the shame of your nakedness may not appear; and eye salve, so that you may anoint your eyes, in order that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I rebuke and discipline. Be zealous therefore, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and I am knocking. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, then I will come in to him and I will dine with him, and he with Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>He that overcomes, I will grant to him to sit with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven, and the first voice which I heard was like a trumpet speaking with me, saying, "Come up here, and I will show you the things which must occur after this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I was in [the] Spirit; and behold, a throne was set in heaven (and One sitting on the throne)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>similar in appearance to a jasper and sardius stone, and there[ was] a rainbow around the throne, in appearance like an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and on the thrones I saw the twenty-four elders sitting, having been clothed in white robes; and on their heads[ were] crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And from the throne proceeded lightnings and voices and thunders. And seven torches of fire [were] burning before His throne, which are seven spirits of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>and before the throne [was something ]like a sea of glass, similar to crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and around the throne, were four living beings full of eyes in front and in back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first living being was like a lion, the second living being [was ]like a calf, the third living being had a face of a man, and the fourth living being was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living beings, each one having six wings apiece, were full of eyes around and within. And they never rest day or night, saying, "Holy, holy, holy, Holy, holy, holy, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, He[ w]ho was, and who is, and who is to come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and thanksgiving to Him that sits on the throne, to Him that lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and they worship Him that lives forever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>"You are worthy, our Lord and God, the Holy [One], to receive the glory and the honor and the power; because You created all things, and by Your will they existed and they were created."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right [hand] of Him that sat on the throne a scroll, having been written inside and outside, [and ]having been sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in heaven above or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, nor to look at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I began to weep much, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll, nor to look at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>But one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome, to open the scroll and its seven seals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living beings, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as [if] slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>Then He came and took out of the right hand of Him that sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls being filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sang a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; because You were slain, and You redeemed us to God by Your blood, out of every tribe and language and people and nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and have made them kings and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>Then I looked, and I heard as it were the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living beings, and the elders. And the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and a thousand thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a loud voice: "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive the power and the wealth and wisdom and strength, and honor and glory and blessing!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: "Blessing and honor and glory and power to Him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever. Amen!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>-and the four living beings said "Amen!"And the elders fell down and worshipped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings saying, like a voice of thunder, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And behold, a white horse. And he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living being saying, "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>Another horse went out, fiery red, and it was granted to him that sat on it to take peace from the earth, so that they might kill each other; and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living being say, "Come."And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living beings, saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being saying, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it was named Death, and Hades was following him. And authority was given to him over a fourth of the earth, to kill with [the ]sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried [with] a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>Then a long white robe was given to them, and it was said to them that they should rest yet a while, until also their fellow servants and their brothers, who were about to be killed as also they [were], should complete [their course].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, that there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, like a fig tree casting its untimely figs, being shaken by a mighty wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>Then the sky was split like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were removed out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the magnates and the high-ranking military men, and the rich and the mighty, and every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the crags of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And they said to the mountains and crags, "Fall on us and hide us from [the] face of Him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of His wrath has come, and who shall be able to stand?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that a wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of those having been sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>of the tribe of Judah twelve thousand having been sealed; of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand; of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand; of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.7'>of the tribe of Simeon twelve thousand; of the tribe of Levi twelve thousand; of the tribe of Issachar twelve thousand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand; of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand; of the tribe of Benjamin twelve thousand, having been sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude which no man could number, out of every nation, and [from] tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, having been clothed in long white robes, with palm branches in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation [belongs] to our God, to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living beings, and they fell down on their faces before His throne and they worshipped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.12'>saying: "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom, and thanksgiving and honor and power and might, [be] to our God forever and ever. Amen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, "Who are these arrayed in long white robes, and where did they come from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>And I said to him, "My lord, you know."So he said to me, "These are those who come out of the Great Tribulation, and have washed their robes and they made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>Therefore they are before the throne of God, and they serve Him day and night in His temple. And He that sits on the throne shall dwell among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.16'>They shall neither hunger anymore nor thirst anymore; nor shall the sun by any means strike them, nor any scorching heat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.17'>because the Lamb who is in the midst of the throne shepherds them, and He leads them to [the ]springs of [the] waters of life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>And when He opened the seventh seal, silence occurred in heaven [for] about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. And much incense was given to him, so that he could offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and he cast it to the earth. And there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>And the first [one] sounded [his] trumpet, and there was hail and fire, having been mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees was burned up, and all green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>Then the second angel sounded [his] trumpet, and [something] like a great burning mountain was cast into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>Then the third angel sounded [his] trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the fountains of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>Then the fourth angel sounded [his] trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them was darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe [for] those who dwell on the earth, from the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are to sound [their] trumpets!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>Then the fifth angel sounded [his] trumpet, and I saw a star having fallen out of heaven, to the earth. And the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>And he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a burning furnace. And the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the shaft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Then out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth. And power was given to them, as scorpions of the earth have power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>They were told not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any plant, nor any tree, but [only] those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>And they were not given authority to kill them, but that they should torment them for five months. And their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>And in those days men shall seek death, and shall by no means find it; they shall be longing to die, yet death shall elude them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>And the appearances of the locusts [was] similar to horses having been prepared for battle, and on their heads [were] like crowns of gold, and their faces [were] like the faces of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots with many horses rushing into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>And they had tails like scorpions, and stings. And in their tails they have power to harm men five months,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>having as a king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>One woe is past. Behold, yet two woes are coming after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>Then the sixth angel sounded [his] trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels having been bound at the great river Euphrates."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>So the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill a third of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>Now the number of the troops of the horsemen was a hundred million; I heard the number of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who rode on them, having breastplates of fire, hyacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses [were] like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed-from the fire and the smoke and the brimstone proceeding out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent from the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and of wood, which neither are able to see nor to hear nor to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their drugs, nor of their fornication or their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>And I saw a mighty angel coming down from heaven, having been clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, and his face [was] like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>and having in his hand a scroll having been opened. And he put his right foot on the sea, but his left [one] on the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>and cried with a loud voice, as [when] a lion roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and after these things you shall write."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it, the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there should be no more delay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to sound [his] trumpet, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>Then the voice which I heard from heaven [was] speaking with me again and saying, "Go, take the little scroll which was open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>And I went to the angel, saying to him to give to me the little scroll. And he said to me, "Take [it ]and eat it up; and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>Then I took the scroll out of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. And when I ate it, my stomach was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>And they said to me, "You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>Then a reed was given to me like a rod, saying, "Rise and measure the temple of God, the altar, and those who worship in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>But leave out the outer court of the temple, and do not measure it, because it has been given to the Gentiles. And they shall trample the holy city for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>And I will give [power] to My two witnesses, and they shall prophesy one thousand two hundred and sixty days, having been clothed in sackcloth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which [are] standing before the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>And if anyone wants to harm them, fire proceeds from their mouth and devours their enemies. And if anyone wants to harm them, he must be killed in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>These [men ]have power to shut heaven, so that no rain falls [during] the days of their prophecy; and they have authority over the waters to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>And when they finish their testimony, the Beast who ascends out of the bottomless pit will make war with them, and will overcome them, and will kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>And their corpse [will lie ]on the street of the great city which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>Then some of the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations saw their corpse three-and-a-half days, and they will not allow their corpses to be put into a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>And those who dwell on the earth rejoice over them, and make merry, and give gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>Now after the three-and-a-half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on those who were watching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here."And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>In that day there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell, and seven thousand men were killed. And the rest became fearful and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>Then the seventh angel sounded [his] trumpet, and there were great voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of this world has become [the kingdom] of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>And the twenty-four elders, those before the throne of God who sit on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshipped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>saying: "We give You thanks, O Lord God Almighty, The One who is and[ ]who was, because You have taken Your great power and have begun to reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.18'>The nations were angry, and Your wrath has come, and the time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that You should reward Your servants the prophets and the saints, and to those that fear Your name, to the small and to the great, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>Then the temple of God was opened in heaven, and the ark of the covenant of the Lord appeared in His temple. And there were lightnings and voices and thunders, and great hail.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman having been clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>And being pregnant, she was crying out, being in labor and being in great pain to give birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>And another sign appeared in heaven: and behold, a great, fiery dragon having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns on his heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>And his tail dragged a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that whenever she might give birth, he might devour her Child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>And she gave birth to a Son, a male who would shepherd all the nations with an iron rod. And her Child was caught up to God and to His throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.6'>Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place having been prepared by God, so that they may nourish her there one thousand two hundred and sixty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>And there came to be war in heaven: Michael and his angels, waging war with the dragon; and the dragon made war, and his angels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>and he did not prevail, nor was a place found for him [any] longer in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>And the great dragon was cast out, that serpent of old, called the Devil and Satan, who deceives the whole world; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast out with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>Then I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, "Now have come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of His Christ, because the accuser of our brothers, the [one] who accused them before our God day and night, has been thrown [out of heaven].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, and they did not love their lives to the death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.12'>Therefore rejoice, O heavens, and you who dwell in them! Woe to the earth and to the sea! Because the devil was thrown down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.13'>Now when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male [Child].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>And the woman was given two wings of a great eagle, so that she might fly into the desert to her place, so that she might be nourished there [for] a time and times and half a time, from [the] face of the serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>And the serpent spewed water out of his mouth like a river after the woman, so that he might cause her to be carried off by the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.16'>But the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river which the dragon had cast out of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.17'>And the dragon was enraged with the woman, and he went off to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>Then I stood on the sand of the sea. And I saw a Beast coming up out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his horns ten crowns, and on his heads blasphemous names.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>And the Beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>And one of his heads [was ]as if it had been slain to death, and his wound of death was healed. And the whole world marveled after the Beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>And they worshipped the dragon who gave authority to the Beast; and they worshipped the Beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>And a mouth was given to him speaking great things and blasphemy, and authority was given to him to make war for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.6'>Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His dwelling, and those who dwell in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.7'>And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, people, language, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.8'>And all those who dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose name is not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.13.10'>If anyone has captivity, he goes away; if anyone [is] with [the] sword, he must be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.11'>Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.12'>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast before him, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it, to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.13.14'>And he deceives my own [people] who dwell on the earth by the signs which were given to him to do before the Beast, saying to those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound-and came to life! -from the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.15'>And it was granted to him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.16'>And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, that they should receive marks on their right hand, or on their foreheads,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.14.1'>And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father having been written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.2'>And I heard a voice from heaven, like [the] voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And the voice which I heard [was] as of harpists playing on their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.3'>And they sang a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.</verse>
