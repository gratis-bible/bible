        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='1John.1'>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.1'>That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have gazed upon, and our hands have handled, concerning the Word of life-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>and the life was manifested, and we have seen, and bear witness, and we declare to you the eternal life which was with the Father and was manifested to us-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>that which we have seen and heard we declare to you, in order that you also may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And these things we write to you that our joy may be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>And this is the message which we have heard from Him and we announce to you, that God is light and in Him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>If we claim that we have fellowship with Him, and we are walking in the darkness, we are lying, and are not practicing the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>But if we are walking in the light, as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus Christ His Son cleanses us from all sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.8'>If we claim that we have no sin, we are deceiving ourselves, and the truth is not in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>If we claim that we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.2'>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. And if someone should sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not only concerning ours, but also concerning [those] of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>Now by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He who says, "I have come to know Him,"and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But whoever keeps His word, truly the love of God is perfected in him. By this we know that we are in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He who claims to abide in Him ought himself also to walk just as He walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Brothers, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, a new commandment I am writing to you, which [thing] is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He who says that he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven you on account of His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know Him[ who is] from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil [one]. I am writing to you, little children, because you have come to know the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I wrote to you, fathers, because you have come to know Him[ who is] from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>Because everything that is in the world-the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life-is not from the Father but is from the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world is passing away, and its lust; but he who does the will of God abides forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, it is the last hour; and just as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but [they went out] in order that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>But you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you know all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I did not write to you because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is a liar but the [one] who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, the [one] who denies the Father and the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>Therefore let that which you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, you also will abide in the Son and in the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise which He Himself promised to you-eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>These things I wrote to you concerning those who deceive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>And [as for] you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, little children, abide in Him, in order that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed due to Him at His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If you know that He is righteous, you know that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>Behold what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us, that we should be called children of God! On account of this the world does not know you, because it did not know Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>Beloved, now we are children of God; and it has not yet been revealed what we shall be, but we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And you know that He appeared that He might take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him nor has he known Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>Little children, let no one deceive you. The [one] who practices righteousness is righteous, just as He is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this [reason] the Son of God appeared, that He might destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>No one who has been born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>By this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>not as Cain who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his works were evil and the [works] of his brother were righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love his brother abides in death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>By this we have come to know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives on behalf of our brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother having need, and shuts off his compassion towards him, how does the love of God abide in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And in this we know that we are from the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>Because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and He knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>And whatever we should ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and we do the things pleasing before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is His commandment: that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and should love one another, just as He gave commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>And the [one] who keeps His commandments abides in Him, and He in him. And by this we know that He abides in us, from the Spirit whom He gave us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits, whether they are from God; because many false prophets have gone out into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>By this the Spirit of God is known: Every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>and every spirit which does not confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God. And this is the [spirit] of the Antichrist, which you have heard that it is coming, and now is already in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.4'>You are of God, little children, and you have overcome them, because He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.5'>They are of the world: on account of this they speak of the world, and the world hears them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.6'>We are of God. He that knows God hears us; [he] that is not of God does not hear us. By this we know the spirit of truth and the spirit of error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>Beloved, let us love one another, because love is of God; and everyone that loves has been born of God and knows God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>He that does not love does not know God, because God is love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>By this the love of God is manifested in us, that God has sent His only begotten Son into the world, in order that we might live through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>In this is love, not that we loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son [to be ]the propitiation for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>Beloved, if in this way God loved us, indeed we ought to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God abides in us, and His love has been perfected in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>(By this we know that we abide in Him, and He in us, because He has given us of His Spirit.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent the Son as Savior of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.15'>Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.16'>And we have come to know and believe the love which God has in us. God is love, and he that abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>By this love has been perfected with us: that we may have confidence in the day of judgment; because just as He is, we also are in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves punishment. But he that fears has not been made perfect in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We love Him because He first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>If anyone claims, "I love God,"and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, how is it possible [for him] to love God whom he has not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>And this commandment we have from Him: that he who loves God should love his brother also.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1John.5'>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.1'>Everyone that believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone that loves Him that begot also loves him that is begotten of Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.2'>By this we know that we love the children of God, whenever we love God and keep His commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.3'>For this is the love of God, that we keep His commandments. And His commandments are not burdensome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.4'>because everything having been born of God overcomes the world: and this is the victory that has overcome the world-your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.5'>Who is he that overcomes the world, if not he that believes that Jesus is the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.6'>This is He who came through water and blood-Jesus Christ, not only by the water, but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is He[ ]who witnesses, because the Spirit is the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.7'>For there are three that bear witness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.8'>the Spirit, the water, and the blood; and these three agree as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.9'>If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; because this is the testimony of God which He has testified concerning His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.10'>He that believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself; he that does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.11'>And this is the testimony: that God has given to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.12'>He that has the Son has life; he that does not have the Son of God does not have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.13'>These things I write to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life, and that you may believe in the name of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.14'>And this is the confidence that we have toward Him, that if we should ask anything according to His will, He hears us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.15'>And if we know that He hears us, whatever we may ask, we know that we have the requests that we have requested from Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.16'>If anyone sees his brother sinning a sin not [leading] to death, he shall ask, and He shall give him life for those who do not sin unto death. There is a sin [leading] to death. I do not say that he should ask about that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.17'>All unrighteousness is sin, and there is sin not [leading] to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.18'>We know that everyone begotten of God does not sin; but he that was begotten of God keeps himself, and the evil [one] does not touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.19'>We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies [under the sway] of the evil [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.20'>And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding, that we may know Him that is true; and we are in Him that is true, in His Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.5.21'>Little children, guard yourselves from idols. Amen.</verse>
