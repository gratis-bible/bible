        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Since many have attempted to arrange a narrative about the matters which have taken place among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered [them] to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also, having followed up accurately all things from above, to write to you in orderly fashion, most distinguished Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood, he was selected to burn incense when he entered into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son to you, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, while still in his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he himself will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to proclaim the good news to you of these things[.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>But behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their season."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people waited for Zacharias, and they marveled at his delaying in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But having come out, he was unable to speak to them; and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he was making signs to them and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it happened, as soon as the days of his service were fulfilled, that he went away to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>Now after those days Elizabeth his wife conceived; and stayed in seclusion five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>"Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name [was] Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel came to her and said, "Greetings, O favored [one], the Lord is with you; blessed [are] you among women!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But when she saw [him], she was greatly perplexed by his saying, and she wondered what sort of greeting this was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>Then the angel said to her, "Fear not, Mary, for you have found grace with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you shall conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God shall give Him the throne of His father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I do not know a man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy Baby which is to be born shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for she who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing shall be impossible."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Then Mary said, "Behold the maidservant of the Lord! May it be to me according to your word."And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Now Mary rose up in those days and traveled into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why am I favored thus, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the baby leaped for joy in my womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she who has believed, because there shall be a fulfillment to the things having been spoken to her from the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said: "My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>Because He looked upon the lowly state of His maidservant; for behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For He that is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has overthrown the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary remained with her about three months, and she returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elizabeth's full time came for her to be delivered, and she bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And when her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her, they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>Now it came to pass on the eighth day, [that] they came to circumcise the child; and they started to call him by the name of his father, Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>His mother answered and said, "No; he shall be called John."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>But they said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>So they made signs to his father about what he wished him to be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And asking for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, "His name is John."And they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he started to speak, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Then fear came on all who lived around them; and all these things were being talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all those who heard them kept them in their hearts, saying, "What kind of child will this be?"And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Now his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been since the world began,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath which He swore to our father Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>to grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>"And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to them that sit in darkness and [in ]the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken of all the empire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This census [was ]the first [one] while Quirinius was governing Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all were traveling to be registered, each to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed [for] her to bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she bore her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And shepherds were in the same country, living in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>Then the angel said to them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this [will be] the sign to you: You will find a Baby wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>So it was, when the angels had departed from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go then to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Baby lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all those who heard it marveled about the things spoken by the shepherds to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary treasured all these things and pondered [them] in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were completed, so they could circumcise Him, His name was called JESUS, the [name] given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>Now when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present [Him] to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(just as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the LORD"),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to what had been said in the law of the Lord, "A pair of doves or two young pigeons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, that they might do for Him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>"Lord, now You are releasing Your servant in peace, according to Your word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for my eyes have seen Your salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory to Your people Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and His mother were marveling at the things being spoken about Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, "Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and she [was] a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And coming in that instant she was giving thanks to the Lord, and was speaking about Him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the Child was growing and becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And His parents traveled to Jerusalem every year to the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when He was twelve years old, when they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and when they completed the days, while they were returning, the Child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and Joseph and His mother did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>But supposing Him to be in the caravan, they went a day's journey, and sought Him among their relatives and among their acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>Now it came to pass that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And those who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and His answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, "Child, why have You treated us this way? Look, Your father and I were seeking You anxiously."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And He said to them, "Why [is it] that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And His mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governing Judea, and while Herod governed as tetrarch of Galilee, and while Philip his brother governed as tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and while Lysanias governed as tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the time of the high priest Annas and [the high priest ]Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he went into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the LORD, make His paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be humbled; the crooked roads shall become straight, and the rough [roads] shall become smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then he said to the crowds which came out to be baptized by him, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax is being laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and is thrown into the fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>So the people were asking him, saying, "What shall we do then?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered and said to them, "He who has two shirts, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, "Collect nothing more than the [amount] which has been commanded to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Likewise the soldiers also were asking him, saying, "And what shall we do?"So he said to them, "Do not intimidate anyone or accuse [anyone ]falsely, and be content with your wages."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>Now while the people waited, and all considered in their hearts about John, whether he might be the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John answered, saying to all, "I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>And with many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>he also added this to all [his other] [sins], and locked up John in the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>Now it came to pass that when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also was baptized, and [was] praying, [that ]the heaven was opened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.22'>and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came out of heaven, saying, "You are My beloved Son; in You I have found delight."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>being tempted [for] forty days by the devil. And in those days He ate nothing, and afterward, when they were completed, He was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>And the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, speak to this stone that it may become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.4'>But Jesus answered him, saying, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>Then the devil, leading Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And the devil said to Him, "All this authority I will give You, and their glory; because it has been given to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>Therefore, if You will worship before me, all will be Yours."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>And Jesus answered and said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! It is written, 'You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him only you shall serve.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>Then he brought Him to Jerusalem, set Him on the pinnacle of the temple, and said to Him, "If You are God's Son, throw Yourself down from here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>For it is written: 'He shall give His angels charge over You, to guard You,'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.13'>Now when the devil had completed every temptation, he departed from Him until an opportune time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>Then Jesus returned in the power of the Spirit to Galilee, and news about Him went out through all the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>And He taught in their synagogues, being glorified by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>And He came to Nazareth, where He had been brought up. And as His custom was, He entered into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and He stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And the book of Isaiah the prophet was given to Him. And having unrolled the scroll, He found the place where it was written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>"The Spirit of the LORD is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to preach the gospel to the poor; He has sent Me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>And having rolled up the scroll, when He had given [it] to the attendant, He sat down. And the eyes of all who were in the synagogue were looking intently at Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>And He began to say to them, "Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your ears."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And all were bearing witness to Him, and were marveling at the gracious words which came out of His mouth. And they said, "Is this not Joseph's son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>He said to them, "You will surely say this proverb to Me, 'Physician, heal yourself! Whatever we have heard done in Capernaum, do also here in Your hometown.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>Then He said, "Assuredly I say to you, no prophet is accepted in his hometown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>But I tell you truly, [there] were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine all over the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>but to none of them was Elijah sent except to Zarephath, in the region of Sidon, to a widow woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.27'>And [there] were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet, and none of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>So all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>and rising up they threw Him out of the city; and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But having passed through the midst of them, He went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Then He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were astonished at His teaching, because His word was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>Now in the synagogue [there] was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>saying, "Ah! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Did You come to destroy us? I know who You are-the Holy [One] of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silenced, and come out from him!"And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, it came out from him, and did not hurt him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And amazement came upon all, and they spoke among themselves, saying, "What [is] this word! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And the report about Him went out into every place of the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And when He arose from the synagogue, He entered into the house of Simon. But Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they made request of Him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>And when He stood over her, He rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately rising up, she began to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>Now when the sun was setting, all those who had any that were sick with various diseases brought them to Him; and He laid His hands on each one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And also demons were coming out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!"And rebuking [them], He did not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>Now when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowds were searching for Him, and they came to Him, and tried to restrain Him from leaving them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>but He said to them, "I must proclaim the good news [of] the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this [purpose] I have been sent."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now it came to pass, while the crowd pressed upon Him to hear the word of God, that He stood by the Lake of Gennesaret,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>and He saw two boats standing by the lake; but the fishermen, [after] getting out of them, were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and He asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, He began to teach the crowds from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>Now when He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep and lower your nets for a catch."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>But Simon answered and said to Him, "Master, we have labored all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will lower the net."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was tearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>So they beckoned to their partners who were in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For astonishment gripped him and all who were with him at the haul of fish which they had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>And likewise also [it gripped] James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear; from now on you shall be catching men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And having brought the boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it came to pass while He was in a certain city, that behold, there was a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, falling on his face he begged Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And reaching out His hand, He touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed."Immediately the leprosy departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And He ordered him to tell no one, "But go and show yourself to the priest, and bring an offering for your cleansing, as a testimony to them, just as Moses prescribed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the report about Him spread all the more; and great crowds came together to hear, and to be healed by Him from their sicknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But He Himself would withdraw into the wilderness and would pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>Now it happened on a certain day that He was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there[,] who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men [were] carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and to lay [him ]before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, going up on the roof, they lowered him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And seeing their faith, He said to him, "Man, your sins have been forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this [Man ]who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But when Jesus perceived their reasonings, He answered and said to them, "Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven you,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins"-He said to the man who was paralyzed, "I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Immediately he rose up before them, taking up [the bed] which he had been lying on, he went off to his own house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And amazement gripped [them] all, and they were glorifying God, and they were filled with fear, saying, "We have seen extraordinary things today!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After these things He went out and saw a tax collector named Levi, sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And leaving everything, he arose and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Then Levi made a great banquet for Him in his own house. And there was a great number of tax collectors and others who were reclining with them [to eat.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And their scribes and the Pharisees complained against His disciples, saying, "Why do You eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answered and said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>Then they said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John fast often and make prayers, and likewise also the [disciples] of the Pharisees, but Yours eat and drink?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>And He said to them, "Can you make the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them; then they will fast in those days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>Then He spoke a parable to them: "No one puts a patch of a new garment on an old one; otherwise both the new [garment] tears, and also the patch that was taken out of the new [garment ]does not match with the old [garment].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine will burst the wineskins and it will be spilled, and the wineskins will be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But [one] must put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no one, having drunk old [wine], immediately desires new; for he says, 'The old is better.' "</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Now it came to pass on the first Sabbath of the second month that He was going through the grainfields. And His disciples were picking the heads of grain and were eating [them], rubbing them in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>But some of the Pharisees said to them, "Why do you do what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>But Jesus answering them said, "Have you not even read this, what David did when he became hungry, he and those who were with him:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>And He said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>Now it happened that on another Sabbath, He entered the synagogue and was teaching. And there was a man there whose right hand was withered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Then Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And when He had looked around at them all, He said to him, "Stretch out your hand."And he did so, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with fury, and they were discussing with one another what they might do to Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.42'>Or how can you say to your brother, 'Brother, permit me to remove the speck which is in your eye,' when you yourself do not see the plank that is in your own eye? Hypocrite! First remove the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck which is in your brother's eye.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>Now when He finished all His sayings in the hearing of the people, He entered Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a certain centurion's servant, who was highly valued by him, was sick and about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And when he heard about Jesus, he sent elders of the Jews to Him, asking Him that He might come and heal his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they begged Him earnestly, saying he was worthy for whom He should grant this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nation, and he himself has built us a synagogue."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far away from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>Therefore I did not even consider myself worthy to come to You. But [just] say the word, and my servant shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man appointed under authority, having soldiers under myself. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does [it]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>When Jesus heard these things, He marveled at him, and turning to the crowd following Him, He said, "I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And when those who were sent returned to the house, they found the servant well who had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>Now it happened on the next [day], that He went into a city called Nain; and many of His disciples went with Him, and a great crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And when He came near the gate of the city, that behold, a dead man was being carried out, the only son of his mother; and she was a widow. And many people from the city was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>When the Lord saw her, He had compassion on her and said to her, "Do not weep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>Then He came and touched the open coffin, and those who carried him stood still. And He said, "Young man, I say to you, arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>So he who was dead sat up and began to speak. And He gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>Then fear took hold of all, and they were glorifying God, saying, "A great prophet has risen up among us"; and, "God has visited His people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report about Him went out in all Judea, and all the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>Then the disciples of John reported to him concerning all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>And summoning two of his disciples, John sent [them] to Jesus, saying, "Are You the Coming [One], or do we look for another?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And when they came to Him, the men said, "John the Baptist has sent us to You, saying, 'Are You the Coming [One], or do we look for another?' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>And in that very hour He healed many from diseases, and torments, and evil spirits; and to many blind [people] He granted sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Go and report to John what you have seen and heard: that the blind regain sight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, the poor are evangelized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And blessed is he who is not offended because of Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>Now when John's messengers had departed, He began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What have you gone out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what have you gone out to see? A man clothed in soft garments? Indeed those who are gorgeously appareled and live in luxury are in royal [palaces].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what have you gone out to see? A prophet? Yes, I say to you, and much more than a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>This is he about whom it is written: 'Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>"For I say to you, among those born of women there is not a greater prophet than John the Baptist; but he who is least in the kingdom of God is greater [than] he."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>And when all the people heard Him, even the tax collectors justified God, having been baptized with the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>But the Pharisees and lawyers rejected the counsel of God for themselves, because they had not been baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>"Therefore to what shall I compare the men of this generation, and what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling to one another, saying: 'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we mourned for you, and you did not weep.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>"For John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, and you say, 'He has a demon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>And so wisdom is justified by all her children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>Then one of the Pharisees asked Him to eat with him. And entering into the Pharisee's house, He reclined [to eat].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she found out that He was reclining in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of perfume,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and standing by His feet behind Him weeping; and she began to wash His feet with her tears, and was wiping [them] with the hair of her head; and she was kissing His feet and anointing [them] with the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee who had invited Him saw this, he spoke within himself, saying, "This [Man], if He were a prophet, would know who and what sort of woman [this is] who touches Him, for she is a sinner."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answered and said to him, "Simon, I have something to say to you."And he said, "Teacher, say it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>There was a certain creditor who had two debtors. One owed five hundred denarii, and the other [owed ]fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>And when they had nothing with which to pay back, he freely forgave them both. Tell [Me], therefore, which of them will love him more?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered and said, "I suppose [it is the one] to whom he forgave more."And He said to him, "You have judged correctly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And turning to the woman, He said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I entered into your house; you gave Me no water for My feet, but this [woman] has washed My feet with her tears and wiped them with the hair of her head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave Me no kiss, but this [woman] has not stopped kissing My feet since the time I came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint My head with oil, but this [woman] has anointed My feet with perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>For which reason I say to you, her many sins have been forgiven, because she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>Then He said to her, "Your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>And those who were reclining at the table with Him began to say within themselves, "Who is this who even forgives sins?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>Then He said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you. Go in peace."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Now it came to pass afterward, that He was traveling through every city and village, preaching and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom of God, and the twelve were with Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and certain women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities; Mary called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza, a supervisor of Herod, and Susanna, and many others who were ministering to them from their belongings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a large crowd had gathered, and the [people] came to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell alongside the road; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And other [seed] fell on rock; and when it grew up, it withered away because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And other [seed] fell among thorns, and when the thorns grew up with it, they choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>But other [seed] fell into good ground, and when it grew up, it produced fruit a hundredfold."Saying these things He was calling out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>Then His disciples asked Him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And He said, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest [they are] in parables, that 'Seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>"Now this is the parable: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>And those beside the road are they that hear; then the devil comes and takes away the word from their hearts, lest they believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>But those on the rock are they that, whenever they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of testing fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell among thorns, these are those, who when they heard, go out and are choked with anxieties, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that which fell on the good ground, these are such who when they heard the word, with a noble and good heart, hold on to it and bear fruit with endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>"No one, when he has lit a lamp, covers it with a vessel or puts [it] under a bed, but sets it on a lampstand, so that those who enter may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For there is nothing hidden which will not become manifest, nor anything concealed which will not be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Therefore take heed how you hear. For whoever has, [more] shall be given to him; and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then His mother and brothers came to Him, and could not approach Him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was told Him by some, who said, "Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, desiring to see You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But He answered and said to them, "My mother and My brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it came to pass on a certain day, that He got into a boat with His disciples. And He said to them, "Let us go across to the other side of the lake."And they put out to sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they sailed, He fell asleep. And a windstorm came down onto the lake, and they were being filled [with water], and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came to Him and awoke Him, saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing!"Then He arose and rebuked the wind and the raging of the water. And they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>But He said to them, "Where is your faith?"But becoming afraid, they marveled, saying to one another, "Who then is this? For He commands both the winds and the water, and they obey Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>Then they sailed to the region of the Gadarenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And when He got out on the land, there met Him a certain man from the city who had demons for a long time. And he wore no clothes, nor did he live in a house, but among the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>And seeing Jesus and crying out, he fell down before Him, and with a loud voice he said, "What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg You, do not torment me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For it had seized him at times, and he was bound, kept under guard, with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him, saying, "What is your name?"And he said, "Legion,"because many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And he kept imploring Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain. And they kept imploring Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then when the demons came out from the man, they entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And when those who fed [them] saw what had happened, they fled and reported [it] in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had come out [of], sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and being of sound mind. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And those also who saw reported to them how the demon-possessed man was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then the whole multitude from the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to go away from them, because they were gripped with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now the man from whom the demons had come out was begging Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>"Return to your house, and tell what great things God has done for you."And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city all the things that Jesus did for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>So it was, when Jesus returned, that the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a leader of the synagogue. And falling at the feet of Jesus, he was imploring Him to enter into his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He was going, the crowds were pressing against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who though she had spent [her] whole livelihood on physicians, was not able to be healed by anyone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>approaching from behind, touched the hem of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, "Who touched Me?"When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the crowds are pressing You hard and crowding You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, "Someone touched Me, for I perceived that power has gone out from Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she recounted to Him before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And He said to her, "Take courage, daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, "Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, "Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When He came into the house, He permitted no one to enter except Peter, John, and James, and the father and mother of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>Now all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, "Do not weep; she is not dead, but asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they were ridiculing Him, knowing that she had died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But He sent them all outside, and having grasped her hand, He called, saying, "Child, arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded [something] to be given to her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>And having called together the twelve, He gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And He said to them, "Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs nor knapsack nor bread nor silver; and do not have two tunics apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>Whatever house you may enter, stay there, and from there go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And as many as will not receive you, when you go out from that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>As they went out, they were going about village by village, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things[ ]being done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, "John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?"And he was seeking to see Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>And the apostles, when they had returned, recounted to Him all that they had done. And taking them along, He withdrew privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But when the crowds found out, they followed Him; and He welcomed them, and was speaking to them about the kingdom of God, and He cured those who needed healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>Now when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to Him, "Dismiss the crowd, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and they may find lodging and find provisions; for we are in a deserted place here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But He said to them, "You give them [something] to eat."And they said, "We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples, "Make them recline in groups of fifty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and made them all recline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>So they all ate and were satisfied, and twelve baskets of the remaining fragments were taken up by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>And it came to pass, while He was alone praying, that His disciples joined Him, and He questioned them, saying, "Who do the crowds pronounce Me to be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>So they answered and said, "John the Baptist, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the ancient prophets has arisen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>He said to them, "But who do you pronounce Me to be?"Peter answered and said, "The Christ of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>And He strictly warned and commanded [them] to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>Then He said to them all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake shall save it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>Now it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And while He was praying, the appearance of His face [became ]different, and His clothing [became] white and glistening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And behold, two men were talking with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appearing in glory were talking about His decease which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; but becoming fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good [for] us to be here; and let us make three tents: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah,"not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>Now as he said these things, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. But they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>Now it happened on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that a great crowd met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, "Teacher, I beg You, look upon my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and it departs from him with great difficulty, bruising him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>So I begged Your disciples that they might cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Then Jesus answered and said, "O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed [him]. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Then a dispute came up among them as to which of them might be greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus, having seen the thought of their heart, taking a little child, He stood him beside Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all shall be great."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>Now John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said to him, "Do not forbid [him], for he who is not against us is for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>Now it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be received up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and sent messengers before His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, so they might prepare for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>But they did not receive Him, because He was determined to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when they saw this, James and John His disciples said, "Lord, do You wish [that] we should call down fire from heaven and consume them, as Elijah did?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But turning, He rebuked them, and said, "You do not know of what sort of spirit you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save [them]."And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>Now it happened as they journeyed on the road, that someone said to Him, "Lord, I will follow You wherever You go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>Then He said to another, "Follow Me."But he said, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, "Lord, I will follow You, but first permit me to say farewell to those who are at my house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.10'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and He sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>Then He said to them, "The harvest indeed [is] great, but the workers [are] few; therefore pray [to ]the Lord of the harvest that He may send forth workers into His harvest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.5'>But whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace to this house.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.9'>And heal the sick there, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.10'>But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.12'>I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.13'>"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.14'>Nevertheless it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.17'>Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.18'>And He said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning out of heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.21'>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.22'>And turning to His disciples He said, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and [the one] to whom the Son wills to reveal [Him]."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.29'>But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Then Jesus answered and said: "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and encountered bandits, who after having stripped him of his clothing and having wounded him, departed, leaving [him] half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>Now by coincidence a certain priest was coming down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.33'>But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came by him; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>And coming to him, he bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and putting him on his own animal, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave [them] to the innkeeper, and said to him, 'Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition, when I come back, I will repay you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.36'>So which of these three does it seem to you proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the bandits?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>And he said, "the [one] who showed mercy to him."Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.11'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.2'>So He said to them, "Whenever you pray, say: Our Father in the heavens, hallowed be Your name. Your kingdom come. Your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.7'>and he will answer from within and say, 'Do not trouble me; the door has already been shut, and my children are with me in bed; I cannot get up and give to you'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.8'>I say to you, even if he will not get up and give to him, because he is his friend, yet on account of his persistence he will get up and give him as much as he needs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.13'>If you then, being evil, know [how] to give good gifts to your children, by how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.14'>And He was casting out a demon, and it was mute. So it was, when the demon came out, that the mute man spoke; and the crowds marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.15'>But some of them said, "He casts out demons by Beelzebub, the ruler of the demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.16'>But others, testing [Him,] were seeking from Him a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.17'>But He, knowing their thoughts, said to them: "Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and a house divided against a house falls.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.8'>So the master praised the unrighteous manager because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder in their own generation than the sons of light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>Then He spoke a parable to them, that one must always pray and not lose heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>saying: "A certain judge was in a certain city, who did not fear God nor have regard for men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>Now there was a widow in that city; and she kept coming to him, saying, 'Give justice to me against my adversary.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>And he did not want to for a time; but afterward he said within himself, 'although I do not fear God, nor have regard for man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>yet because this widow bothers me I will give justice to her, lest she wear me out by forever coming to me.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>Then the Lord said, "Hear what the unjust judge said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And God, shall He not execute justice for His own elect, who cry out day and night to Him, and yet He is patient with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I tell you that He will execute justice for them speedily. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will He really find faith on the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised the others:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, 'God, I thank You that I am not like other men-swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a week, I tithe [on ]all things, as many as I acquire.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>And the tax collector, standing far away, would not so much as lift his eyes towards heaven, but beat on his chest, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>And they were bringing infants to Him, that He might touch them; but when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus, summoning them, said, "Allow the little children to come to Me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>Assuredly I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God as a little child will by no means enter into it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>Now a certain ruler asked Him, saying, "Good Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>So Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, that is, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not murder,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not bear false witness,' 'Honor your father and your mother.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>And he said, "All these I have kept from my youth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>So when Jesus heard these things, He said to him, "Still one thing you lack: sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven; and come, follow Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But when he heard this, he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>And when Jesus saw that he became very sad, He said, "How hard it is for those who have riches to enter the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>And those who heard it said, "Who then is able to be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>But He said, "These things which are impossible with men are possible with God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>Then Peter said, "See, we have left all and followed You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>So He said to them, "Assuredly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or parents or brothers or wife or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>who shall not receive many times more in this present time, and in the age to come eternal life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>Then taking the twelve aside, He said to them, "Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man will be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For He will be betrayed to the Gentiles, and will be mocked and insulted and spit upon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>and having scourged [Him,] they will kill Him. And on the third day He will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>But they understood none of these things; this saying was hidden from them, and they did not know what was being said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>Now it came to pass, as He was coming near Jericho, that a certain blind man sat alongside the road begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>And hearing a crowd traveling through [the city], he asked what this was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>And they reported to him that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>And he shouted, saying, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have pity on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>And having stopped, Jesus commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he drew near, He asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>saying, "What do you desire [that] I should do for you?"And he said, "Lord, that I may receive [my] sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>Then Jesus said to him, "Receive [your] sight; your faith has made you well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>And immediately he received [his] sight, and was following Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw [this], gave praise to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>And having entered, He passed through Jericho.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>And he was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>And running up ahead in front, he went up into a sycamore tree so that he might see Him, because He was about to pass by that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when He came upon that place, Jesus looked up and saw him, and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>So he hurried and came down, and received Him, rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>But when they saw it, they all were complaining, saying, "He has gone to be a guest with a sinful man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the poor; and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I restore fourfold."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>Now as they heard these things, He told another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>Therefore He said: "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>And having called ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Do business till I come.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We will not have this man to reign over us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded those servants to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, so that he might know who gained what by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>Then came the first, saying, 'Master, your mina has earned ten minas.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>And he said to him, 'Well [done], good servant; because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second came, saying, 'Master, your mina made five minas.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>Likewise he said to him, 'You also be over five cities.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>Then another came, saying, 'Master, behold your mina, which I had laid away in a handkerchief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>And he said to him, 'Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I did not deposit, and reaping what I did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why then did you not give my money to a bank, and when I came, I would have collected it with interest?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>And he said to those standing by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>"But they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>For I say to you that to everyone who has, [more] shall be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>And having said these things, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>And it came to pass, as He drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, to the mountain which is called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, "Go into the village opposite you, in which when you enter you will find a colt tied up, on which no one of men has ever sat. Loose him and bring [him] [here].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you loosing [him]?' thus you shall say to him, 'Because the Lord has need of him.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent departed and found it just as He told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, "Why are you loosing the colt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>And they said, "The Lord has need of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>Then they brought him to Jesus. And when they threw their own clothes on the colt, they set Jesus on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as He went, they were spreading their clothes under [Him] on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>And as He was approaching the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying: "'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the LORD!' Peace in heaven and glory in the highest! "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>And some of the Pharisees said to Him from the crowd, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>But He answered and said to them, "I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And as He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, "If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things pertaining to your peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>And when He entered into the temple, He began to drive out those buying and selling in it,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>Now it came to pass on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, that the priests and the scribes, together with the elders, confronted Him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and they spoke to Him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is he who gave You this authority?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>But He answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one thing, and so tell Me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>The baptism of John-was it from heaven or from men?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they debated among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why [then] did you not believe him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded [that] John was a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>So they answered that they did not know where it was from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then He began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the farmers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers flogged him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And again he sent another servant; and they flogged him also, treated him shamefully, and sent [him] away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and threw [him] out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps when they see him they will respect [him].'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others."And when they heard it they said, "May it never be!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>Then He looked at them and said, "What then is this which is written: 'The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him that very hour, but they were afraid-for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And having watched [Him] closely, they sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on His words, in order to deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>Then they asked Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show favoritism, but teach the way of God in truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But perceiving their craftiness, He said to them, "Why do you test Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?"They answered and said, "Caesar's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>But they could not catch Him in His words in front of the people. And marveling at His answer, they kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Then some of the Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, coming to Him and asked Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying: "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife, and this [man ]dies childless, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers. And the first, having taken a wife, died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And the second took her as wife, and this [man ]died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife does she become? For all seven had her [as] wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answered and said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But those who have been counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>nor can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Now even Moses revealed that the dead are raised, in [the passage about] the [burning ]bush, when he called the Lord 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>"For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all are alive to Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then some of the scribes answered and said, "Teacher, You have spoken well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>But after that they dared not question Him anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And He said to them, "How [is it that] they say the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>Even David himself said in the Book of Psalms, 'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>"Therefore David calls Him 'Lord'; how is He then his Son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And as all the people listened, He said to His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk about in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at dinners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>And looking up, He saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>And He said, "Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put [in] more than all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>For all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put [in] all the livelihood which she had."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>Then, as some spoke about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, He said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>So they asked Him, saying, "Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what [will be ]the sign when these things are about to happen?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>And He said: "Take heed that you not be deceived. For many will come in My name, saying, 'I AM,' and, 'The time has drawn near.' Therefore do not go after them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>Then He said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful events and great signs from heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread drew near, which is called Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might kill Him, for they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>And he went off and spoke with the chief priests and captains [about] how he might betray Him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad, and agreed to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>And he promised, and was seeking an opportunity to betray Him to them in the absence of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Pascal Lamb must be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>And He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat [it]."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>And He said to them, "Behold, when you have entered the city, a man will meet you carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house where he goes in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>Then you shall say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says to you, "Where is the guest room in which I may eat the Passover with My disciples?"'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went and found it just as He had said to them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>When the hour had come, He reclined [to eat], and the twelve apostles with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>Then He said to them, "I have fervently desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and said, "Take this and divide it among yourselves;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>Now you are those who have remained with Me in My trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>But he said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Then He said, "I say to you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>And He said to them, "When I sent you without a money bag, and a knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything?"And they said, "Nothing."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>So they said, "Lord, look, here are two swords."And He said to them, "It is enough."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>And going out, He went to the Mount of Olives, according to His custom, and His disciples also followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>And having come to the place, He said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>saying, "Father, if You will, remove this cup from Me-nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in agony, He prayed more fervently. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down onto the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>And rising up from prayer, coming to the disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>Then He said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise up and pray, lest you enter into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>And while He was still speaking, behold, a crowd; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, "Have you come out, as against a bandit, with swords and clubs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>And having arrested Him, they led Him and brought Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter was following from a distance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And after a little [while] another [person ]saw him and said, "You also are [one ]of them."But Peter said, "Man, I am not!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>Then after about one hour had passed, another was firmly insisting, saying, "Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying!"And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, "Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And going outside, Peter wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Now the men who were holding Jesus were mocking Him and beating [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>And having blindfolded Him, they were striking His face and asking Him, saying, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>And when it became day, the council of the elders of the people, the chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>"If You are the Messiah, tell us."But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will by no means believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>But if I also question you, you will by no means answer Me or release [Me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>Then they all said, "Are You then the Son of God?"So He said to them, "You [rightly] say that I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>And they said, "What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth!"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this [Man] perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate questioned Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?"He answered him and said, "You are saying [what is] [so]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>But Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this Man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And when he found out that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he was hoping to see some miracle being done by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and scribes stood, vehemently accusing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then Herod, with his men of war, having treated Him with contempt, and having mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilate, having called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said to them, "You have brought this Man to me, on the charge of misleading the people. And indeed, when I examined Him in your presence, I found no guilt in this Man in the matters which you bring as charges against Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>and neither [did] Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>Therefore when I have flogged Him, I will release [Him.]"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this [Man], and release to us Barabbas"-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>who because of a certain insurrection having occurred in the city had been thrown into prison, and for murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>Then he said to them the third [time], "Why, what evil did He do? I have found no guilt deserving death in Him. Therefore when I have flogged Him, I will release [Him]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And their voices and [those] of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So Pilate decided [that] their request should be carried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released whom they were requesting, who because of insurrection and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, [as he was] coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also were mourning and lamenting Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed [are] the barren, and [the] wombs which did not give birth, and breasts which did not nurse!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin 'to say to the mountains, "Fall on us!"and to the hills, "Cover us!"'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And they also were leading two others with Him, evildoers, to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him and the evildoers, one on the right, and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."And dividing His garments, they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood, observing. And the rulers with them also were sneering, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the elect of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And an inscription also was written over Him, in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew letters: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>Then one of the evildoers who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, "If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, "Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this Man did nothing wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>Then he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when You come in Your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>Now it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came upon the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, "Father, 'into Your hands I will commit My spirit.' "And after He said these things, He expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>And when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous Man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowds which came together for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, beat their own chests and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(this [man] had not agreed to their decision and deed), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And having taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth, and put it in a tomb cut out of rock, where no one had ever lain before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>That day was the Preparation; the Sabbath was drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>But they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And going in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>Then, as they became afraid and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying, 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered His words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary [the mother] of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed like nonsense before them, and they disbelieved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter rose up and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen strips lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they were conversing with one another about all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>So it was, as they were conversing and discussing, that Jesus Himself drew near and started to travel with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not recognize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And He said to them, "What [are ]these words which you are exchanging with one another as you walk, and you have a gloomy look?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, "Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and do not know what has happened in it in these days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And He said to them, "What things?"So they said to Him, "The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who proved to be a man [who was ]a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Moreover certain women of our group astonished us, after they arrived early at the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And not finding His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it thus just as also the women had said; but Him they did not see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then He said to them, "O [you ]foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and He made as though He was going farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent."And He went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>Now it came to pass, as He was reclining [to eat] with them, having taken bread, He blessed and broke it, and He gave [it] to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to one another, "Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, and while He was interpreting the Scriptures to us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they described the things that had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, "Peace to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But being alarmed and becoming fearful, they thought they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And He said to them, "Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>But as they still disbelieved for joy, and marveled, He said to them, "Do you have any food here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And taking it, He ate [it ]in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>Then He said to them, "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>Then He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And behold, I am sending the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up His hands, He blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it happened, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And after they had worshipped Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
