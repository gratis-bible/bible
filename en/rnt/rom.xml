  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

  <div type='book' osisID='Rom'>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>PAUL, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart to bear the good news of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>which he foretold through his prophets in Holy Scripture,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son Jesus Christ our Lord (who became one of the descendants of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>and was with power proved to be the Son of God according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>through whom we obtained grace and apostleship to promote obedience of faith for the sake of his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among all the Gentiles, among whom are you, called by Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>to all who are in Rome, beloved by God, called to be holy: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First of all I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is spoken of through all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God, whom I serve in my spirit in the good news of his Son, is my witness how unceasingly I make mention of you, always in my prayers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>asking if I may somehow at some time by the will of God find the way open to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you that I may impart to you some spiritual gift of grace in order that you may be strengthened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that is, that I may be encouraged with you and by you through our mutual faith, yours and mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>I am not willing that you should be ignorant, brethren, that often I have purposed to come to you <note>though until now I have been hindered</note>, in order that I might have some fruit among you as among the other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am a debtor to Greeks and to Barbarians, to wise men and to unthinking men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>so, for my part, I am eager to tell the good news also to you in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the good news. It is the power of God for salvation to every one who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For a righteousness of God is revealed in it from faith to faith, as it is written, "He who is righteous by faith shall live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all impiety and wickedness of men who hold the truth but practice unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because what may be known of God is manifest within them, for God has manifested it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For God's invisible qualities \'97 his everlasting power and deity \'97 are, since the creation of the world, clearly seen, being known from what he has made. So they are without any excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>For although they knew God they did not glorify him as God and did not give him thanks, but fell into futile speculations and their stupid hearts were darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Boasting of being wise, they became fools</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into images of mortal man, and of birds and beasts and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God gave them over, in the lusts of their hearts, to uncleanness, to dishonor their bodies mutually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>They changed the truth of God into a lie, and reverenced and paid worship to the creature rather than to the Creator \'97 who is blessed forever, Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>Therefore God gave them over to disgraceful passions. For their females changed the natural use for one contrary to nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>and their males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust for one another, males with males practicing indecency and receiving in themselves the deserved penalty of their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And as they did not think fit to keep God in their knowledge, God gave them over to an abandoned mind, to do the things that are shameful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>filled with all injustice, wickedness, greed, malice, full of envy, murder, strife, fraud, malignant craftiness, whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>slanderers, hateful to God, insolent, arrogant, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>without common sense, without faithfulness, without family affection, without pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>They know the just judgment of God that those who practice such things are worthy of death, yet they not only do them themselves, but are pleased with those who practice them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>THEREFORE you are without excuse, O man, whoever you are, when you judge. For in judging another you condemn yourself. For you, the judge, practice the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those who practice such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>Do you think, O man, you who judge those who practice such things while you do the same, that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you despise the wealth of his kindness and forbearance and long-suffering, not knowing that the kindness of God is calling you to a change of heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>Are you with a hard and unrepentant heart treasuring for yourself wrath for the day of wrath and for the revelation of the just judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>He will give to each an award according to his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>To those who by constancy in good work seek for glory and honor and immortality he will award life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But to those of a partisan spirit who do not obey the truth, but obey wickedness, there will be wrath and hot anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Distress and crushing calamity will fall upon every human soul that works evil, upon the Jew first and also upon the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory and honor and peace will come to every one who works good, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For God has no partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>As many as have sinned without a law will perish without a law, and as many as have sinned under law will be judged by law</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(for it is not the hearers of law who are righteous before God, but the doers of law are pronounced righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>for when Gentiles who have no law do by nature what the Law enjoins, these, although they have no law, are a law to themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>they show the requirements of the Law written in their hearts, since their conscience corroborates it and their thoughts argue in mutual accusation or in self-defense),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>on the day when God judges the secrets of men through Jesus Christ, as my good news sets forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>But if you bear the name of Jew and rely upon the Law, and make your boast in God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know his will and are a judge of things that differ, because you have been taught out of the Law</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and are confident that you yourself are a guide of the blind, a light of those who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of the unwise, a teacher of the simple, because you have the form of knowledge and of truth in the Law \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>you who are teaching another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach not to steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You who say not to commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You who boast of the Law, do you dishonor God by breaking the Law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For "The name of God is reviled among the Gentiles because of you," as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Circumcision has value if you obey the Law. But if you are a breaker of the Law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>If an uncircumcised man keeps the requirements of the Law, shall not his uncircumcision be credited for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And the natural uncircumcision if it keeps the Law will judge you who with a written code and circumcision are still a law-breaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For it is not he who is one outwardly that is a Jew, nor is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>But he who is one secretly is a Jew, and circumcision is of the heart and in the spirit, not in the letter. His praise is not from men, but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>WHAT then is the advantage of the Jew, or what is the benefit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every way. First, they were intrusted with the oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some were faithless, will their faithlessness prevent the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Never. Let God be true, but every man a liar, as it is written, "That thou mayest be proved right in thy words and triumph when thou art judged."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness shows the righteousness of God, what shall we say? Is God unrighteous when he inflicts his wrath? <note>I am speaking humanly.</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>Never. If so how can God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>But if the truth of God has become more abundant to his glory through my lie, why am I still condemned as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>We are not going to say, as some people slanderously affirm that we say, "Let us do evil that good may come," are we? The condemnation of such people is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Have we an advantage? Not at all. We have already brought the charge against both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>as it is written, "There is not even one righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>there is none that seeks God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>All have turned away; together they have become worthless; there is none who does what is useful, not even one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat is an open sepulcher; with their tongues they deceive; the poison of asps is under their lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>Their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>ruin and misery are in their paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>The path of peace they do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no reverence for God before their eyes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>We know that all that the Law says, it says to those who are under the Law, that every mouth may be shut and all the world may come under the condemnation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore by works of the Law no human being will be pronounced righteous before him. For through the Law comes the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now, apart from law, a righteousness of God has been revealed, confirmed by the Law and the Prophets \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>a righteousness from God through faith in Jesus Christ for all believers. For there is no difference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>All have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>All are pronounced righteous by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God has set forth as a propitiation by his blood through faith, for the manifestation of his righteousness, because of the passing over of previous sins in the forbearance of God \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>for a manifestation at the present time of his righteousness, that he may himself be righteous and may accept as righteous him who has faith in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where then is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? That of works? No, but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>For we reason that a man is pronounced righteous by faith aside from works of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Does God belong to the Jews only? Does he not belong also to the Gentiles? Yes, to the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>if God is one and will pronounce the circumcision righteous by faith and the uncircumcision righteous through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we then by faith nullify the Law? Never. On the contrary we establish the Law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>WHAT then shall we say that Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh, experienced?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham was pronounced righteous because of works, he had something to boast of. But he had nothing before God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>for what says the Scripture? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him for righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>To him who works, wages are credited not as by grace, but as due;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>but to him who does not work, but believes in him who calls the unrighteous man righteous, his faith is credited for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>Just so David speaks of the blessedness of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>"Blessed are they whose lawless acts have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man whose sin the Lord will not charge up to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Does this blessedness come to the circumcision, or also to the uncircumcision? For we say, "Faith was credited to Abraham for righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How was it credited, when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of faith that he had in uncircumcision, so that he should be the father of all who believe while uncircumcised, and righteousness should be credited to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and the father of the circumcised, that is, of those who are not only circumcised, but who walk in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham had while uncircumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>It was not through the Law that the promise came to Abraham or to his descendants that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if those who are of the Law are heirs, faith is emptied of value and the promise is nullified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>For the Law works wrath. But where there is no law, neither is there lawbreaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore all depends on faith, that it may be of grace, and thus the promise be sure for all his descendants, not only those who are of the Law, but also those who are of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of all of us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>
          <note>as it is written, "I have made thee a father of many nations"</note>, in the view of the God whom he believed, who makes alive the dead and calls things that are not as if they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Abraham, when hope was past, believed in hope so that he became the father of many nations, according to what was said to him, "So shall your descendants be";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>and without being weakened in faith he recognized his own body as dead, when he was about a hundred years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>Still he did not hesitate through want of faith in the promise of God, but was strong in faith, thus giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and was fully confident that what God had promised he was able to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>Therefore it was credited to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>It was not written for his sake only, that it was credited to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but also for our sake, to whom it will be credited if we believe in him who raised up from the dead Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered up on account of our sins and was raised again that we might be accounted righteous.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>SO then, since we have been accounted righteous by faith, let us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>Through him we obtained entrance into this grace in which we stand and exult in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>Not only so, but we also exult in trials, knowing that trial develops endurance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and endurance develops a tested character, and a tested character develops hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>and hope does not disappoint, for the love of God has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit granted to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For while we were still without strength Christ, at the due time, died for the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Hardly for a righteous man will any one die. For a good man some one perhaps may dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God shows his own love to us in that while we were still sinners Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then, now that we have been pronounced righteous through his blood, shall we be saved from wrath by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if while enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so, but we exult in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now obtained the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore as through one man sin entered the world, and through sin death entered, and so death spread to all men, since all sinned \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>for down to the time of the Law sin was in the world, and yet sin is not charged where there is no law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>but death reigned from Adam to Moses even over those who had not sinned like Adam, who is the type of him who was coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But the gracious gift is not like the fall. For if by the fall of the one the many sinned, much more did the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound to the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And the free gift was not like the sentence that came through one who sinned; for the sentence came from one fall for condemnation, but the free gift was that men should be called righteous in spite of many falls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by the fall of one man death reigned through that one, much more those who receive the abounding grace and the free gift of righteousness will reign in life through one, that is, through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>As then through one fall sentence came upon all men and they were condemned; so through one righteous act the free gift came to all men so that they are pronounced righteous and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as by the disobedience of the one man the many were set down as sinners, so by the obedience of the one the many will be set down as righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But law came in alongside that the fall might be greater; but where sin became greater grace became greater still,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>in order that as sin reigned in death grace might reign through righteousness and issue in life eternal through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>WHAT shall we say then? Shall we remain in sin so that grace may be great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>Never. How shall we who died to sin still live in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We were buried with him by baptism into death, in order that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have grown into union with him by the likeness of his death, surely we shall be united with him by the likeness of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>For we know this, that our old-time humanity was crucified with him, in order that the sinful body might be made powerless, that we might no longer be slaves of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For one who has died has been pronounced righteous and free from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>But if we died with Christ we believe that we shall live with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that Christ, after being raised from the dead, dies no more; death no more reigns over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For the death that he died, he died to sin once for all; but the life that he lives, he lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So you must think yourselves dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Do not let sin reign in your mortal body so that you will obey its lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>and do not yield your members to sin as the instruments of wickedness; but present yourselves to God as men once dead, but now living, and yield your members to God as the instruments of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not be king over you; for you are not under law, but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? May we sin because we are not under law, but under grace? Never.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as servants intending obedience, you are the servants of the one you obey, whether of sin, resulting in death, or of obedience, resulting in righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>Thanks be to God that though you were slaves of sin you became obedient from the heart to the type of teaching in which you were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>You were made free from sin and made servants to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I am speaking humanly on account of the weakness of your human nature. As you did present your members as servants to impurity and to lawlessness to do lawlessness, so now you have presented your members as servants to righteousness for holy living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>When you were servants of sin you were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>What fruit did you have then? Fruit of which you are now ashamed; for the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now freed from sin and having become servants of God you have your fruit in holy living and its outcome, life eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin is death, but the gracious gift of God is life eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>ARE you ignorant, brethren, for I am speaking to those who know law, that the Law rules over a person while he is living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For a married woman is by law bound to her husband while he is living. But if the husband dies, she is freed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>Therefore while her husband is living she is called an adulteress if she becomes another man's. But if her husband dies she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress when she becomes another man's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>So, my brethren, you were made dead to the Law through the body of Christ, that you might become wedded to another, to him who was raised from the dead, that we might bear fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh the sinful passions that arise through the Law were active in our members, so that we bore fruit to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now the Law has been made inoperative on us, since we have died to that by which we were held, so that we serve in newness of the spirit and not in oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? Is the Law sin? Never. But I should not have come to know sin except through the Law. I should not have known lust if the Law had not said, "Thou shalt not lust."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>Sin, taking occasion through the commandment, worked in me every lust. For apart from the Law sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>I was living once, apart from law. But when the commandment came, sin began to live and I died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>and the commandment which meant life was found to mean death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking occasion through the commandment, deceived me and by it killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>So the Law is holy and the commandment is holy and just and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Did then what is good become death to me? Never. But sin, that it might appear sin, worked death in me through the good, in order that it might become beyond measure sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the Law is spiritual; but I am fleshly, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For what I am doing I do not understand. For not what I choose is what I practice, but what I hate, this I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>But if I do what I do not choose, I agree with the law that it is right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>And now it is no longer I that do it, but the Sin that dwells in me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>I delight in the Law in my inner man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I see another law in my members, warring with the law of my mind and leading me captive under the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then I myself with my mind serve the Law of God, but with my flesh the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>THERE is therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has freed you from the Law of sin and death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For, what was impossible for the Law, because it was weak through the flesh \'97 God, sending his own Son in the form of sinful flesh and for sin, condemned the sin that is in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>so that the righteousness required by the Law might be fulfilled in us who live not according to the flesh, but according to the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For those who are living according to the flesh have their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who are living according to the spirit have their minds on the things of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>Fleshly mindedness is death, but spiritual mindedness is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Therefore fleshly mindedness is hostile to God; for it is not subject to the Law of God, nor can it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if the Spirit of God dwells in you. If any one has not the Spirit of Christ, that man is not his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>If Christ is in you the body is dead because of sin, but the spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>If the Spirit of him who raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised up Christ Jesus from the dead gives life even to your mortal bodies, through his indwelling Spirit in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh to live according to the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>for if you live according to the flesh, you will die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you did not receive a spirit of bondage leading again to fear, but you received a spirit of sonship, in which we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit itself witnesses with our spirits that we are children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, we are also heirs \'97 heirs of God, joint heirs with Christ, since we suffer with him that we may also be glorified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I estimate that the sufferings of this present time amount to nothing in comparison with the glory that is to be revealed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creation is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was made subject to folly not willingly, but for the sake of him who subjected it, in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>because the creation itself will be freed from the slavery of decay into the glorious freedom of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that all the creation groans in the pangs of childbirth until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not the creation alone, but we ourselves also who have the first-fruits of the Spirit, groan within ourselves in expectation of the sonship, the liberation of our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For we are saved by hope; but hope that is seen is not hope, for what any one sees, why does he hope for?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for what we do not see, we patiently wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Thus also the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itself intercedes for us with sighs beyond words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because he intercedes for the holy according to the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to his purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>For those whom he foreknew he also predetermined to be conformed to the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born among many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>And those whom he predetermined he also called, and those whom he called he also pronounced righteous, and those whom he pronounced righteous he also glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What then shall we say to this? If God is for us, who is against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He who did not spare his own Son, but gave him up for us all, how shall he not with him graciously give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall bring a charge against God's elect? God pronounces them righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is there to condemn? Christ Jesus died, or rather was raised, and he is on the right hand of God interceding for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from Christ's love? Shall trial or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>On the contrary, in all these we more than conquer through him who loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor archangels, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>That is, not the physical descendants are children, but the children of the promise are counted for descendants.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>And not only so, but when Rebecca was about to bear children to our father Isaac,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>though the same man was father of both children and they were not yet born and had done nothing good or bad, in order that the purpose of God according to his choice might stand, not according to their works, but according to his call,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>it was said to her, "The older shall serve the younger."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I raised you up in order to show my power upon you and to have my name proclaimed in all the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So then he has mercy on whom he chooses and he hardens whom he chooses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness to every believer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses writes that he who does the righteousness of the Law shall live by it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And they if they do not continue in their unbelief will be grafted in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For God is able to graft them back. For if you were cut from your natural stock, a wild olive tree, and were grafted, contrary to nature, into a good olive tree, how much more will the natural branches be grafted into their own olive tree!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>I would not have you ignorant, brethren, of this mystery, that you may not be self-conceited, because stupidity in a measure has come upon Israel until the full number of Gentiles comes in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>and thus all Israel will be saved, as it is written, "From Zion will come the deliverer. He will remove ungodliness from Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>And this is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>According to the good news they are enemies for your sake, but according to the promise they are beloved for their fathers' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>God never changes his mind about his gifts and his call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For as you were once disobedient to God, but now have found mercy through their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>so they have now been disobedient in your time of mercy, that they too may now obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>For God has shut up all in unbelief in order that he may have mercy on all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O the depth of the wealth both of the wisdom and the knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments, how untraceable his ways!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.34'>For who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who became his counsellor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.35'>Who first gave to him so as to receive repayment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.36'>For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory through the ages! Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.1'>I BEG you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living and holy sacrifice, pleasing to God \'97 your rational worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.2'>Do not follow the fashions of this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your minds so as to recognize what is the good and pleasing and perfect will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>Through the grace given to me I say to every one among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought, but to think so as to become wise, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For as in one body we have many members and the members do not all have the same function,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>so we who are many are one body in Christ and individually members of one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.6'>Having gifts differing according to the grace given to us, if it is prophecy, let us use it according to the proportion of our faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.7'>if it is service, let us use it in service. Let the teacher use his gift in teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.8'>Let the exhorter use his gift in exhorting. Let him who gives do it in simplicity. Let him who manages do it earnestly. Let him who helps the needy do it cheerfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.9'>Let your love be without pretense. Abhor what is evil; cling to the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.10'>Have brotherly love toward one another like family affection, in honor preferring one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.11'>never flagging in zeal, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.12'>rejoicing in hope, patient in trial, constant in prayer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.13'>contributing to the needs of the holy, devoted to hospitality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.14'>Pray for blessings on your persecutors, blessings, not curses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.15'>Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.16'>Be in harmony with one another. Do not be thinking of high things, but be content with humble things. Do not become conceited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.17'>Repay to no one evil for evil. Aim at what is honorable in the sight of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If possible, so far as depends on you, live at peace with all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>Do not revenge yourselves, beloved, but give place to God's wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay, says the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.20'>But, "if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him drink; for in so doing you will heap coals of fire on his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.21'>Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>LET every person be obedient to the superior authorities. For there is no authority except from God and the actual authorities have been appointed by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>So he who resists the authority opposes the arrangement of God. Those who resist will bring on themselves condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a terror to good deeds, but to bad. Do you wish not to fear the authority? Do what is good and you will have praise from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is a servant of God to promote your good. But if you are doing evil, be afraid; for he does not bear the sword to no purpose. For he is God's servant to inflict his wrath on him who practices evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Therefore we must be obedient, not only because of the punishment but as a matter of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For this reason also you pay tribute. For they are God's officers attending to this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Pay to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due, custom to whom custom is due, respect to whom respect is due, honor to whom honor is due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>Owe no one anything, except to love one another. He who loves the other has fulfilled the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>For the commandments, "Thou shalt not commit adultery," "Thou shalt not commit murder," "Thou shalt not steal," "Thou shalt not covet," and any other that there may be, are summed up in this: "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love works no evil to a neighbor. Love therefore is full obedience to the Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>Live thus because you know this crisis, for it is already time for you to awake from sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we became believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night is far spent, the day draws near. Let us put away the deeds of darkness, let us put on the weapons of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>Let us live becomingly as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in sensuality and licentiousness, not in quarrelling and jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for gratifying physical passions.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.1'>WELCOME him who is weak in the faith, but not in order to decide disputed questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.2'>One man believes in eating all things. The weak man eats vegetables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>The man who eats is not to despise the one who does not eat, and he who does not eat is not to judge the one who eats. For God has accepted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who are you to judge the servant of another? To his own master he stands or falls, and stand he will, for God is able to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>One man esteems one day above another, another man esteems every day. Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who regards the day regards it to the Lord and he who eats eats to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God. And he who does not eat abstains for the Lord and gives thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For no one of us is living for himself and no one dies for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>If we live we live for the Lord and if we die we die for the Lord. So whether we live or die we are the Lord's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>For to this end Christ died and lived again, in order that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>But you, why do you judge your brother? Or you, why do you treat your brother with contempt? For we shall all stand before the judgment seat of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>For it is written, "As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bend to me and every tongue shall confess to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>So then each one of us shall give account for himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Therefore let us no longer judge one another, but let us rather decide not to put a stumbling block in a brother's way, or anything to trip him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is defiling in itself. But to one who thinks anything to be defiling it is defiling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>If because of your food your brother is grieved, you are no longer walking in love. Do not with your food destroy him for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Do not let what is good to you be spoken of as evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of God is not food and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For he who thus serves Christ is pleasing to God and esteemed by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Therefore, let us seek for what makes for peace and our mutual upbuilding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>Do not for the sake of food break down the work of God. All things are pure, but anything is evil to the man who eats it with a feeling of doing wrong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is noble not to eat meat or to drink wine or to do anything over which your brother stumbles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>The faith that you have, have to yourself before God. Blessed is the man who does not condemn himself for what he allows himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>He who has doubts and still eats stands condemned, because he is not acting from faith. But whatever does not spring from faith is sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.1'>WE who are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, and not to please ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.2'>Each of us should please his neighbor for his good so as to build him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.3'>For Christ did not please himself, but, as it is written, "The reproaches of those who were reproaching thee fell on me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.4'>All that was written of old was written for our instruction, in order that by patience and by the encouragement of the Scriptures we may have hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.5'>May the God of patience and encouragement grant to you to have harmony with one another, in the manner of Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.6'>so that with one mind and one voice you may glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.7'>Therefore, welcome one another as Christ welcomed us, to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.8'>For I say that Christ became a servant of circumcision for the sake of God's truth, in order to confirm the promises given to the fathers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.9'>and that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy, as it is written, "For this will I confess thee among the Gentiles and sing to thy name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.10'>And again Scripture says, "Rejoice, Gentiles, with his people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.11'>And again, "Sing to the Lord, all Gentiles, and let all the peoples praise him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.12'>And again Isaiah says, "There will be a root of Jesse, and one who rises to rule Gentiles: in him Gentiles will hope."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.13'>May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that you may abound in hope through the power of the Holy Spirit!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.14'>I am persuaded, my brethren \'97 yes, I myself \'97 regarding you, that you are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able to instruct one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.15'>But I have written rather boldly to you, partly to remind you, because of the grace given to me from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.16'>that I may be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, in priestly service of the good news of God, in order that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.17'>I do boast in Christ Jesus of my work for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>For I will not venture to speak except of what Christ has done through me to promote obedience of Gentiles, by word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>through the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Holy Spirit, so that from Jerusalem around to Illyricum, I have fully proclaimed the good news of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>being ambitious to tell the good news where Christ has not been named, so that I might not build on any other man's foundation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.21'>but as it is written, "They who have had no message of him shall see and they who have not heard shall understand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>This is why I have been so much hindered in coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now having no more territory in these regions and having for many years had a strong desire to come to you</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>while making a journey to Spain, I hope to see you as I pass through and to be furthered on my journey by you, after first partially satisfying my desire of being with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I am on my way to Jerusalem to render service to the holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make a contribution for the poor among the holy in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>They have been pleased to do this and indeed they are indebted to them. For if the Gentiles have shared their things of the spirit, they owe them sacred service in things of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>So after completing this and sealing to them this fruit, I shall come away and pass by you to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>And I know that when I come to you it will be in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>I beg you, brethren, for the sake of our Lord Jesus and the love of the Spirit to join me in wrestling in prayer to God on my behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judaea and that my service in Jerusalem may be pleasing to the holy,</verse>
