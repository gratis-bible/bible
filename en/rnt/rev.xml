  Many people do not understand any language easily except the living English 
  language of today. The translator of this version, William G. Ballantine, 
  felt that they should have the New Testament in that language. Despite the 
  majesty and the beauty of the King James Version, it was at this time three 
  hundred years behind the times. Since it was printed, scholars have provided 
  us a more correct copy of the Greek original and a clearer understanding of 
  its meaning than our forebears possessed. Also over three centuries many 
  familiar words have been forgotten while many other have taken on new 
  significations.

  A number of translations have been put forth to meet these needs. Some have 
  great merit, but all have left something to be desired. The translator felt a 
  profound sense of obligation to offer his contribution. He was a lifelong 
  student of the New Testament in Greek and English. He realized the work of 
  any translator falls short of perfection. Unavoidable defects are inherent to 
  the very nature of what is attempted. However, defects from ignorance or 
  oversight can be corrected in future editions.

  The translation was made directly from the original Greek. Nestle's text was 
  generally followed. However, he also used The Twentieth Century New 
  Testament, Weymouth's New Testament in Modern Speech, Moffat's New 
  Translation of the New Testament, the Revised Version, and the King James 
  Version. Proper names were left as they were in the American Revised Version.
  It was written in paragraph form with no verse numbering, but with chapter 
  numbers in Roman numerals.

      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>A REVELATION of Jesus Christ which God gave to him, to make known to his servants things which must soon take place. He sent and made it known through his angel to his servant John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who bears witness to the message of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ \'97 everything that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who reads, and blessed are those who hear the words of this prophecy and keep in mind what is written in it; for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven Churches in Asia: Grace be to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the first-born of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and freed us from our sins by his blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and made us a kingdom, priests to God his Father, to him be glory and power for the ages of the ages! Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>He is coming with clouds and every eye will see him, even of those who pierced him, and all the tribes of the earth will beat their breasts because of him. Yes, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>"I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who shall be, the Almighty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, your brother and fellow sharer in the distresses and the kingdom and the endurance in Jesus, came to the island called Patmos, for the sake of the message of God and the testimony of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I became in the Spirit on the Lord's day and heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, "What you see write in a book, and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>I turned to see the voice that was speaking with me, and upon turning I saw seven golden lampstands</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed in a robe that reached his feet, and girded across the breast with a golden girdle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and his hair were white, like white wool, like snow, and his eyes were like a flame of fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet were like fine brass when molten in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>He had in his right hand seven stars, and from his mouth there issued a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining in full strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>When I saw him I fell at his feet as if dead. But he laid his right hand on me and said: "Do not fear. I am the first and the last</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and the living one. I became dead, but now I am living for the ages of the ages, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write what you have seen, and what is and what is to be hereafter \'97 </verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>"To the Angel of the Church in Ephesus write: "These things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks in the midst of the seven golden lamp-stands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know your works and your labor and your endurance, and that you cannot bear wicked people, and you have tried those who say that they are apostles though they are not, and you have found them liars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>You have endurance and you have borne for the sake of my name and you have not been discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have this against you, that you have lost your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember then from where you have fallen, and repent and do your former works. Otherwise I am coming to you and will move your lampstand from its place, if you do not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>"To the Angel of the Church in Smyrna write: "These things says the First and the Last, who died and returned to life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know your distress and poverty, but you are rich, and I know the profane words from those who say that they are Jews though they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Do not fear what you are soon to suffer. The Devil will soon cast some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and you will have distress ten days. Be faithful to death and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches. He who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>"To the Angel of the Church in Pergamum write: "These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know where you live, where the throne of Satan is. Yet you are holding fast my name and did not disown faith in me even in the days when Antipas, my faithful witness, was killed beside you where Satan lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you, because you have some who hold the teaching of Balaam who taught Balak to cast a stumbling block before the sons of Israel: to eat things sacrificed to idols and to commit unchastity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>And even you have some who likewise hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent, therefore. Otherwise I am coming to you shortly, and I will make war upon them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>"To the Angel of the Church in Thyatira write: "These things says the Son of God, he who has eyes like a flame of fire and feet like fine brass:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your works and your love and your faith and your service and your endurance, and that your last works are more than your first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have against you that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and leads astray my servants to commit unchastity and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>I gave her time to repent, but she will not repent of her unchastity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>See, I will cast her into a bed and those who commit adultery with her into great distress, unless they repent of their deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>and her children I will surely kill. All the churches shall know that I am he who searches hearts and will give to each of you according to your deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But I say to the rest of you in Thyatira, as many as do not hold this teaching, who have not known the depths of Satan, as they say, I do not lay on you any other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But hold fast what you have until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>He who conquers and keeps my commands to the end \'97 I will give him authority over the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>and he will shepherd them with a rod of iron, as earthenware is broken to pieces, just as I also have received from my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>"To the Angel of the Church in Sardis write: "These things says he who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars: "I know your deeds, that you have the name of being alive, but are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Become watchful and strengthen the things that remain, which are about to die. For I have not found any works of yours complete before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember, then, how you have received and heard, and give attention and repent. Unless you watch, I will come like a thief and you will not know at what hour I will come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But you have a few names in Sardis which have not stained their garments, and they shall walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who conquers shall be thus clothed in white garments, and I will not erase his name from the book of life, but will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>"To the Angel of the Church in Philadelphia write: "These things says the Holy, the True, he who has the key of David, who opens and no one shuts and who shuts and no one opens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>"I know your deeds. See, I have set before you an opened door which no one can shut, because you have a little power and you have kept my word and have not disowned my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>See, I will make those from the synagogue of Satan, men who call themselves Jews when they are not but are lying \'97 I will make them come and bow down before your feet and they shall know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept my command of patient endurance, I also will keep you from the hour of trial which is about to come on all the world, to try the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He who conquers \'97 I will make him a pillar in the Temple of my God and he will never go out, and I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which is coming down from heaven from my God, and I will write on him my own new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>Let him who has an ear hear what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>"To the Angel of the Church in Laodicea write: "These things says the Amen, the faithful and true Witness, the Beginning of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>"I know your deeds \'97 that you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I shall spew you out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you say, 'I am rich and have grown wealthy and lack nothing,' and do not know that you are wretched and pitiable and poor and blind and naked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel you to buy from me gold refined in the fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments to put on, so that the shame of your nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>All that I love I rebuke and discipline. Be earnest, then, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>See, I am standing at the door and knocking. If any one listens to my voice and opens his door, I will come in with him and will feast with him and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>He who conquers \'97 to him I will grant to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>AFTER this I looked and there was an open door in heaven and the voice that I had heard at first, as if of a trumpet speaking with me, said, "Come up here and I will show you things that must come to pass hereafter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I became in the Spirit. A throne was standing in heaven and on the throne One was sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>He who was sitting there was in appearance like a jasper stone and a sardius. A rainbow, in appearance like an emerald, encircled the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Around the throne I saw twenty-four thrones and on these thrones twenty-four elders seated, clothed in white garments and with golden crowns on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>From the throne issued lightnings and voices and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne. These are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>Before the throne there was as it were a glassy sea, like crystal. Near the throne and around the throne there were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like a calf, the third living creature had a face like a man's, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>The four living creatures have each six wings, and around and within they are full of eyes. They cease not saying day and night, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, who lives for the ages of the ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne and worship him who lives for the ages of the ages, and they cast their crowns before the throne saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>"Worthy art thou, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for thou didst create all things and because of thy will they existed and were created."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>THEN I saw in the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne a book with writing inside and outside and closely sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book and loose its seals?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>But no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the book or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>I wept much because no one was found worthy to open the book or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>Then one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. The Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered and can open the book and its seven seals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>Then I saw midway between the throne and the four living creatures and the elders a Lamb standing. He seemed as if he had been slain. He had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>He came and took the book from the right hand of him who was sitting on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>When he took the book the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp and a golden bowl full of incense, which is the prayers of the holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>Then they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy art thou to take the book and to open its seals, for thou wast slain and didst ransom for God by thy blood men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and hast made them a kingdom of priests to our God, and they shall be kings on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>Then I looked and I heard the voices of many angels encircling the throne and the voices of the four living creatures and of the elders \'97 the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands \'97</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>crying aloud, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all creatures in them, I heard saying, "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and power for the ages of the ages."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>The four living creatures said, "Amen," and the elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>THEN I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals and I heard one of the living creatures say, as if with a voice of thunder, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>I looked and there came a white horse, and he who was sitting on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him and he went forth conquering and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>When he opened the second seal I heard the second living creature say, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>Then another horse came out. It was fiery red, and to him who was sitting on it was granted to take peace from the earth so that men should kill one another, and a great sword was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>When he opened the third seal I heard the third living creature say, "Come." I looked and there came a black horse, and he who was sitting on it had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>I heard what seemed a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A measure of wheat for a shilling and three measures of barley for a shilling. But do no harm to the oil or the wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>When he opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>I looked and there came a pale yellow horse. The name of him who was sitting on it was Death, and Hades was following along with him. Authority was granted to them over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and with famine and with pestilence and with the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the sake of God's message and because of the testimony which they had borne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>They cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Ruler holy and true, wilt thou delay to judge and take vengeance for our blood upon those who dwell on the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>To each of them a white robe was given, and it was said to them that they must wait quietly yet a little while until the number of their fellow servants and their brethren was complete, who were yet to be killed as they had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>I saw when he opened the sixth seal and there came a great earthquake and the sun became black, like sackcloth of hair, and the moon became all like blood</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars of heaven fell to the ground, as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when shaken by a strong wind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>and the sky passed away like a scroll when it is rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved out of its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>Then the kings of the earth and the great men and the generals and the rich and the strong and every slave and freeman hid themselves in the caves and the rocks of the mountains</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>and said to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>for the day, the great day, of their wrath has come and who can stand?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>AFTER this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind might blow on the land or on the sea or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>Then I saw another angel ascending from the east, with the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the land and the sea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>and said, "Do not harm the land or the sea or any tree until we seal the servants of our God on their foreheads."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>I heard the number of those who were sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed, Of the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>Of the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After this I looked and there was a great multitude which no one could count, out of all nations and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb clothed in white robes and with palms in their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>and they shouted with a loud voice saying, "Salvation to our God who sits upon the throne and to the Lamb!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>And all the angels stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.15'>For this reason they are before the throne of God and worship him day and night in his Temple, and he who sits on the throne will spread his tent over them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>WHEN he opened the seventh seal there came a silence in heaven for about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and much incense was given to him for him to put with the prayers of all the holy on the golden altar before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>The smoke of the incense from the hand of the angel went up with the prayers of the holy before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>Then the angel took the censer and filled it from the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth, and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>Then the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>The first sounded his trumpet and there came hail and fire mixed with blood, and it was hurled upon the earth. A third of the earth was burned up and a third of the trees were burned up and all green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>The second angel sounded his trumpet and, as it were, a great mountain burning with fire was hurled into the sea. A third of the sea became blood</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>and a third of the creatures in the sea, those that had life, died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>The third angel sounded his trumpet and there fell from heaven a great star burning like a torch. It fell upon a third of the rivers and upon the springs of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>The name of the star is called Wormwood. Then a third of the waters became worm-wood, and many people died from the waters because they had been made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>The fourth angel sounded his trumpet and a blight fell upon a third part of the sun and a third part of the moon and a third part of the stars, so that a third part of them was darkened, and the day had no light for a third part of it, and the night was darkened in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>Then I looked and I heard an eagle that was flying in mid-heaven say with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe to those who are living on the earth, because of the rest of the trumpet-blasts which the three angels are soon to sound!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>THE fifth angel sounded his trumpet and I saw a star that had fallen from heaven to the earth. There was given to him the key of the pit of the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>And he opened the pit of the abyss and smoke came up from the pit like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun was darkened and the air also by the smoke of the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Out of the smoke came locusts upon the earth, and power was given to them such as earthly scorpions have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>It was said to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth nor anything green nor any tree, but only the people that did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>It was not granted to them to kill such, but to torment them five months. Their torture was like the torture of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>In those days men will seek for death and will not find it and will long to die, but death will fly from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses equipped for battle. On their heads were, as it were, crowns like gold, and their faces were like human faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>They had hair like the hair of women. Their teeth were like those of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>They had breastplates like breastplates of iron. The noise of their wings was like the noise of many-horsed chariots rushing into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>They have tails as scorpions have, and stings, and with their tails they have power to harm men five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss, whose name <note>Destroyer</note> is in Hebrew Abaddon, but in Greek Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>One woe has passed. Two woes are still to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>The sixth angel sounded his trumpet and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar before God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>saying to the sixth angel with the trumpet, "Loose the four angels that are chained at the great river Euphrates."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>So the four angels were loosed, they who were prepared for the hour and day and month and year to kill a third of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>The number of the troops of cavalry was twice ten thousand times ten thousand. I heard their number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>This is how the horses and those who sat on them appeared to me in the vision: The riders had breastplates, fiery red, dark blue, and sulphur yellow. The heads of the horses were like the heads of lions, and from their mouths came fire and smoke and sulphur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three plagues a third of men were killed \'97 by the fire and the smoke and the sulphur that came out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents with heads, and with these they do injury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>But the rest of men, who were not killed by these plagues, neither repented of the deeds of their hands nor ceased worshiping the demons and their idols of gold and silver and brass and stone and wood, which can neither see nor hear nor walk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>nor did they repent of their murders nor of their magic nor of their unchastities nor of their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>THEN I saw another strong angel descending from heaven. He was clothed in a cloud and the rainbow was over his head. His face was like the sun and his legs were like pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>He had in his hand a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea and his left on the land</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>and shouted with a loud voice like the roar of a lion. When he had shouted the seven thunders spoke, each its own message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>When the seven thunders had spoken I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders have spoken and do not write it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>Then the angel whom I had seen standing on the sea and on the land lifted his right hand to heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>and swore by him who lives for the ages of the ages, who formed heaven and all things in it and the earth and all things upon it and the sea and all things in it, "There shall be no more delay,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>but in the days of the blast of the seventh angel, when he soon shall sound his trumpet, then the mystery of God has been finished, according to the good news that he gave to his servants the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>Then the voice which I had heard from heaven spoke again with me and said, "Go, take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little book. He said to me, "Take it and eat it. It will make your stomach bitter, though in your mouth it will be sweet like honey."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>I took the little book from the hand of the angel and ate it, and in my mouth it was sweet like honey, but after I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>They said to me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, tongues, and kings."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>THEN a reed like a measuring stick was given to me with the words, "Rise and measure the Temple of God and the altar and those who are worshiping at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>But the court outside the Temple omit and do not measure it, for it has been given over to the Gentiles and they will trample down the holy city forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>I will grant to my two witnesses to prophesy a thousand, two hundred and sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>They are the two olive trees and the two lampstands which stand before the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>If any one wishes to harm them fire comes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. If any one shall wish to harm them, in this way he must be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>They have power to shut up heaven so that no rain shall fall during the days that they are prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and power to smite the earth with every kind of plague as often as they please.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>When they have completed their testimony, the Beast that is coming up out of the abyss will make war with them and conquer them and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>Their corpses will lie in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>Men of all peoples and tribes and tongues and nations will look at their corpses three days and a half and will not permit their corpses to be placed in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>Those who live on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and send gifts to one another, because the two prophets tormented those who live on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>After the three days and a half the breath of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet. Then great fear fell on those who were looking at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>They heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here," and they went up into heaven in the cloud while their enemies were looking at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>At that hour occurred a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell and seven thousand men were killed by the earthquake. The rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second Woe has passed: the third Woe will come soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>The seventh angel sounded his trumpet and there came loud voices in heaven saying, "The kingship of the world has become our Lord's and his Christ's and he will be king for the ages of the ages."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>Then the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>saying, "We thank thee, Lord God Almighty, who art and wast, that thou hast taken thy great power and hast become king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.18'>The Gentiles raged, but thy wrath came and the time to judge the dead and to give the reward to thy servants the prophets and to the holy who reverence thy name, the small and the great, and to destroy those who are destroying the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>Then the Temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of his covenant in his temple was seen in his temple, and there came lightnings and voices and thunders and an earthquake and a great hailstorm.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>A GREAT sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun. The moon was under her feet and on her head was a crown of twelve stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>She was with child and cried out in the pangs and anguish of child-birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>There appeared also another sign in heaven, a great fiery-red Dragon with seven heads and ten horns. On his heads were seven diadems</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>and his tail dragged a third of the stars of heaven and hurled them to the ground. The Dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth to a child, so that he might devour the child as soon as it was born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>She gave birth to a son who is to shepherd all the nations with a rod of iron. Then the child was caught up to God and to his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.6'>The woman fled into the wilderness where she has from God a prepared place, that they may nourish her there a thousand two hundred and sixty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>War arose in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the Dragon. The Dragon and his angels fought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>but they failed, and no place was found for them any longer in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>Then was hurled down the great Dragon, the ancient serpent who is called the Devil and Satan, who misleads the whole world \'97 he was hurled to the earth and his angels were hurled with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>I heard a loud voice in heaven say, "Now has come the salvation and power and kingship of our God and the authority of his Christ, because the accuser of our brethren has been hurled down, he who accuses them before our God day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>But they have conquered him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of testimony to him, and they loved not their lives even to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.12'>Therefore, rejoice, O heavens, and you who tent in them! Alas for the land and the sea! For the Devil has gone down to you in great wrath, knowing that he has but a little time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.13'>When the Dragon saw that he had been hurled to the earth he pursued the woman who had given birth to the man-child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>Then there were given to the woman two wings of a great eagle to fly into the wilderness to her place, where she shall be fed for a time and times and half a time, hidden from the view of the Serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>The Serpent poured from his mouth after the woman water like a river, to sweep her away with a flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.16'>But the earth helped the woman and the earth opened its mouth and drank up the river that the Dragon had poured out of his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.17'>Then the Dragon was enraged against the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her offspring who keep the commands of God and hold the testimony concerning Jesus.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.13'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>THEN I stood on the sand of the sea and I saw rising out of the sea a Beast with ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten diadems and upon his heads were profane names.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>The Beast that I saw was like a leopard, but his feet were like a bear's feet and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The Dragon gave to him his own power and his throne and great authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>I saw one of his heads, as it were, mortally wounded, but the mortal wound was healed. The whole world followed the Beast in amazement,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>and they worshiped the Dragon because he had given such power to the Beast, and they worshiped the Beast, saying, "Who is like the Beast, and who can battle with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>There was given to him a mouth speaking boasts and profanities, and there was given to him power to act for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.6'>He opened his mouth to insult God, to speak profanely of his name and of his Tent and of those who tent in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.7'>It was granted to the Beast to make war with the holy and to conquer them, and power was granted to him over every tribe and people and tongue and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.8'>All the inhabitants of the earth will worship him, all whose names have not been written from the foundation of the world in the slain Iamb's Book of Life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.13.11'>Then I saw another Beast coming up out of the land. It had two horns like those of a lamb, but it spoke like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.12'>It exercises all the authority of the first Beast in his presence. It compels the earth and its inhabitants to worship the first Beast whose mortal wound was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.13'>It does great signs, making fire descend from heaven to earth in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.14'>It leads astray the inhabitants of the earth because of the signs which it has been granted power to do in the presence of the Beast. It tells the inhabitants of the earth to make an image of the Beast which was wounded by the sword, yet lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.15'>Power was granted to it to give breath to the image of the Beast, so that the image of the Beast spoke and it caused all who did not worship the image of the Beast to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.16'>It causes all, small and great, rich and poor, freemen and slaves, to have a mark put on their right hands or on their foreheads,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.16'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>THEN I heard a loud voice saying from the Temple to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God upon the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>The first went away and poured his bowl upon the land, and there came an evil and malignant ulcer on the men who had the mark of the Beast and those who worshiped its image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>The second angel poured out his bowl upon the sea, and it became blood like that of a dead man and every living thing that was in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>The third angel poured out his bowl upon the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>Then I heard the angel of the waters saying, "Just art thou who art and wast, the Holy One, because thou hast so judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>for they poured out the blood of thy holy ones and prophets and thou hast given them blood to drink. They deserve it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>Then I heard the altar saying, "Yes, O Lord God Almighty, true and just are thy judgments."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was granted to him to scorch men with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>Men were scorched with great heat and they insulted the name of God who had power over these plagues, but they did not repent and give him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>The fifth angel poured out his bowl upon the throne of the Beast, and his kingdom became darkened and men bit their tongues from pain</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>and insulted the God of heaven for their pains and their ulcers, but they did not repent of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up to make a road ready for the kings from the sunrising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>Then I saw come out of the mouth of the Dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the False Prophet three impure spirits like frogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>They are the spirits of demons who work miracles, and they go forth to the kings of the whole habitable world to gather them for the battle of the great day of God the Almighty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>The seventh angel poured out his bowl on the air, and a loud voice came from the Temple, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>Then came lightnings and voices and thunders and a great earthquake. So great an earthquake has not occurred since man came upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>The great city was divided into three parts and the cities of the Gentiles fell. Then Babylon the Great was remembered before God \'97 to give to her the cup of the wine of his fierce wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>Every island fled and the mountains were not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>And great hailstones each weighing about a hundred pounds fell from heaven on men. Men insulted God because of the hail, for the plague of it was great.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>THEN came one of the seven angels that had the seven plagues and spoke with me. He said, "Come here. I will show you the doom of the great prostitute who sits on many waters</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet beast covered with profane names, and with seven heads and ten horns.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received kingly power, but they will receive power as kings for one hour with the Beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>They have one mind and they give over their power and authority to the Beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>They will make war with the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings. They who are with him, called and chosen and faithful, will also conquer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>He said to me, "The waters that you saw where the prostitute was sitting are peoples and crowds and nations and tongues.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>For in one hour this vast wealth has given place to desolation.' " Every ship captain and every one who sails anywhere, and sailors and all who gain their living on the sea, stood afar</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>and shouted as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, "What city could compare with the great city?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>They threw dust upon their heads and shouted as they wept and wailed, saying, "Alas, alas, for the great city in which all who had ships on the sea grew rich from her wealth! For in an hour she has been desolated.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>Then I saw heaven open and there was a white horse, and he who was sitting on it was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>His eyes are a flame of fire and on his head are many diadems. He has a name written which no one but himself knows,</verse>

They lived and reigned as kings with Christ a thousand years,</verse>
