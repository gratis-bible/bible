      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <title>that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work.</title>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to further the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth which accords with godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life which God, who never lies, promised ages ago</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by command of God our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus, my true child in a common faith:  Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>This is why I left you in Crete, that you might amend what was defective, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>if any man is blameless, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of being profligate or insubordinate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop, as God's steward, must be blameless; he must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but hospitable, a lover of goodness, master of himself, upright, holy, and self-controlled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>he must hold firm to the sure word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute those who contradict it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many insubordinate men, empty talkers and deceivers, especially the circumcision party;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>they must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for base gain what they have no right to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of themselves, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>instead of giving heed to Jewish myths or to commands of men who reject the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the pure all things are pure, but to the corrupt and unbelieving nothing is pure; their very minds and consciences are corrupted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God, but they deny him by their deeds; they are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good deed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But as for you, teach what befits sound doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>Bid the older men be temperate, serious, sensible, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>Bid the older women likewise to be reverent in behavior, not to be slanderers or slaves to drink; they are to teach what is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>and so train the young women to love their husbands and children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>to be sensible, chaste, domestic, kind, and submissive to their husbands, that the word of God may not be discredited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Likewise urge the younger men to control themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>Show yourself in all respects a model of good deeds, and in your teaching show integrity, gravity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>and sound speech that cannot be censured, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Bid slaves to be submissive to their masters and to give satisfaction in every respect; they are not to be refractory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>nor to pilfer, but to show entire and true fidelity, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God has appeared for the salvation of all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>training us to renounce irreligion and worldly passions, and to live sober, upright, and godly lives in this world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>awaiting our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>who gave himself for us to redeem us from all iniquity and to purify for himself a people of his own who are zealous for good deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>Declare these things; exhort and reprove with all authority. Let no one disregard you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for any honest work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by men and hating one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>but when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>he saved us, not because of deeds done by us in righteousness, but in virtue of his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>so that we might be justified by his grace and become heirs in hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>The saying is sure.  I desire you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to apply themselves to good deeds; these are excellent and profitable to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid stupid controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels over the law, for they are unprofitable and futile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>As for a man who is factious, after admonishing him once or twice, have nothing more to do with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a person is perverted and sinful; he is self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I send Artemas or Tych'icus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicop'olis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apol'los on their way; see that they lack nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let our people learn to apply themselves to good deeds, so as to help cases of urgent need, and not to be unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith.  Grace be with you all.</verse>
