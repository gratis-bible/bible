      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <title>Uri'ah the Hittite: thirty-seven in all.</title>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now King David was old and advanced in years; and although they covered him with clothes, he could not get warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Therefore his servants said to him, "Let a young maiden be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait upon the king, and be his nurse; let her lie in your bosom, that my lord the king may be warm."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a beautiful maiden throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Ab'ishag the Shu'nammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>The maiden was very beautiful; and she became the king's nurse and ministered to him; but the king knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Now Adoni'jah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, "I will be king"; and he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, "Why have you done thus and so?" He was also a very handsome man; and he was born next after Ab'salom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>He conferred with Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah and with Abi'athar the priest; and they followed Adoni'jah and helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shim'e-i, and Re'i, and David's mighty men were not with Adoni'jah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>Adoni'jah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatlings by the Serpent's Stone, which is beside En-ro'gel, and he invited all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the royal officials of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benai'ah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Then Nathan said to Bathshe'ba the mother of Solomon, "Have you not heard that Adoni'jah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now therefore come, let me give you counsel, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go in at once to King David, and say to him, `Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your maidservant, saying, "Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne"? Why then is Adoni'jah king?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>So Bathshe'ba went to the king into his chamber (now the king was very old, and Ab'ishag the Shu'nammite was ministering to the king).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>Bathshe'ba bowed and did obeisance to the king, and the king said, "What do you desire?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>She said to him, "My lord, you swore to your maidservant by the LORD your God, saying, `Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, behold, Adoni'jah is king, although you, my lord the king, do not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>He has sacrificed oxen, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abi'athar the priest, and Jo'ab the commander of the army; but Solomon your servant he has not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, "Here is Nathan the prophet." And when he came in before the king, he bowed before the king, with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, "My lord the king, have you said, `Adoni'jah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he has gone down this day, and has sacrificed oxen, fatlings, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king's sons, Jo'ab the commander of the army, and Abi'athar the priest; and behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, `Long live King Adoni'jah!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and your servant Solomon, he has not invited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then King David answered, "Call Bathshe'ba to me." So she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore, saying, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>as I swore to you by the LORD, the God of Israel, saying, `Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead'; even so will I do this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bathshe'ba bowed with her face to the ground, and did obeisance to the king, and said, "May my lord King David live for ever!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>King David said, "Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada." So they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>And the king said to them, "Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>and let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there anoint him king over Israel; then blow the trumpet, and say, `Long live King Solomon!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>You shall then come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne; for he shall be king in my stead; and I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada answered the king, "Amen! May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, say so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As the LORD has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and the Cher'ethites and the Pel'ethites, went down and caused Solomon to ride on King David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>There Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent, and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet; and all the people said, "Long live King Solomon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people went up after him, playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>Adoni'jah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. And when Jo'ab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, "What does this uproar in the city mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abi'athar the priest came; and Adoni'jah said, "Come in, for you are a worthy man and bring good news."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>Jonathan answered Adoni'jah, "No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and the Cher'ethites and the Pel'ethites; and they have caused him to ride on the king's mule;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>and Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon; and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>Solomon sits upon the royal throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>Moreover the king's servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, `Your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne.' And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And the king also said, `Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who has granted one of my offspring to sit on my throne this day, my own eyes seeing it.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>Then all the guests of Adoni'jah trembled, and rose, and each went his own way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adoni'jah feared Solomon; and he arose, and went, and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon, "Behold, Adoni'jah fears King Solomon; for, lo, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, `Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not slay his servant with the sword.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, "If he prove to be a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth; but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to King Solomon; and Solomon said to him, "Go to your house."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>When David's time to die drew near, he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>"I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>and keep the charge of the LORD your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his ordinances, and his testimonies, as it is written in the law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>that the LORD may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, `If your sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail you a man on the throne of Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>"Moreover you know also what Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Ama'sa the son of Jether, whom he murdered, avenging in time of peace blood which had been shed in war, and putting innocent blood upon the girdle about my loins, and upon the sandals on my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But deal loyally with the sons of Barzil'lai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table; for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Ab'salom your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And there is also with you Shim'e-i the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahu'rim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahana'im; but when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the LORD, saying, `I will not put you to death with the sword.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore hold him not guiltless, for you are a wise man; you will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>Then David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years; he reigned seven years in Hebron, and thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>So Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father; and his kingdom was firmly established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>Then Adoni'jah the son of Haggith came to Bathshe'ba the mother of Solomon. And she said, "Do you come peaceably?" He said, "Peaceably."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>Then he said, "I have something to say to you." She said, "Say on."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>He said, "You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign; however the kingdom has turned about and become my brother's, for it was his from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me." She said to him, "Say on."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, "Pray ask King Solomon--he will not refuse you--to give me Ab'ishag the Shu'nammite as my wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>Bathshe'ba said, "Very well; I will speak for you to the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>So Bathshe'ba went to King Solomon, to speak to him on behalf of Adoni'jah. And the king rose to meet her, and bowed down to her; then he sat on his throne, and had a seat brought for the king's mother; and she sat on his right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, "I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me." And the king said to her, "Make your request, my mother; for I will not refuse you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>She said, "Let Ab'ishag the Shu'nammite be given to Adoni'jah your brother as his wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>King Solomon answered his mother, "And why do you ask Ab'ishag the Shu'nammite for Adoni'jah? Ask for him the kingdom also; for he is my elder brother, and on his side are Abi'athar the priest and Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then King Solomon swore by the LORD, saying, "God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adoni'jah his life!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore as the LORD lives, who has established me, and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adoni'jah shall be put to death this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>So King Solomon sent Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada; and he struck him down, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And to Abi'athar the priest the king said, "Go to An'athoth, to your estate; for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you bore the ark of the Lord GOD before David my father, and because you shared in all the affliction of my father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon expelled Abi'athar from being priest to the LORD, thus fulfilling the word of the LORD which he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>When the news came to Jo'ab --for Jo'ab had supported Adoni'jah although he had not supported Ab'salom-- Jo'ab fled to the tent of the LORD and caught hold of the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And when it was told King Solomon, "Jo'ab has fled to the tent of the LORD, and behold, he is beside the altar," Solomon sent Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, saying, "Go, strike him down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>So Benai'ah came to the tent of the LORD, and said to him, "The king commands, `Come forth.'" But he said, "No, I will die here." Then Benai'ah brought the king word again, saying, "Thus said Jo'ab, and thus he answered me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>The king replied to him, "Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him; and thus take away from me and from my father's house the guilt for the blood which Jo'ab shed without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>The LORD will bring back his bloody deeds upon his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and slew with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Ama'sa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>So shall their blood come back upon the head of Jo'ab and upon the head of his descendants for ever; but to David, and to his descendants, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace from the LORD for evermore."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>Then Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada went up, and struck him down and killed him; and he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>The king put Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada over the army in place of Jo'ab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abi'athar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>Then the king sent and summoned Shim'e-i, and said to him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and do not go forth from there to any place whatever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For on the day you go forth, and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die; your blood shall be upon your own head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shim'e-i said to the king, "What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do." So Shim'e-i dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shim'e-i's slaves ran away to Achish, son of Ma'acah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shim'e-i, "Behold, your slaves are in Gath,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>Shim'e-i arose and saddled an ass, and went to Gath to Achish, to seek his slaves; Shim'e-i went and brought his slaves from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And when Solomon was told that Shim'e-i had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>the king sent and summoned Shim'e-i, and said to him, "Did I not make you swear by the LORD, and solemnly admonish you, saying, `Know for certain that on the day you go forth and go to any place whatever, you shall die'? And you said to me, `What you say is good; I obey.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then have you not kept your oath to the LORD and the commandment with which I charged you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king also said to Shim'e-i, "You know in your own heart all the evil that you did to David my father; so the LORD will bring back your evil upon your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the LORD for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>Then the king commanded Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada; and he went out and struck him down, and he died.  So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt; he took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David, until he had finished building his own house and the house of the LORD and the wall around Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>Solomon loved the LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father; only, he sacrificed and burnt incense at the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place; Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings upon that altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.5'>At Gibeon the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream by night; and God said, "Ask what I shall give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said, "Thou hast shown great and steadfast love to thy servant David my father, because he walked before thee in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward thee; and thou hast kept for him this great and steadfast love, and hast given him a son to sit on his throne this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.7'>And now, O LORD my God, thou hast made thy servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child; I do not know how to go out or come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.8'>And thy servant is in the midst of thy people whom thou hast chosen, a great people, that cannot be numbered or counted for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.9'>Give thy servant therefore an understanding mind to govern thy people, that I may discern between good and evil; for who is able to govern this thy great people?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>And God said to him, "Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.22'>But the other woman said, "No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours." The first said, "No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine." Thus they spoke before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.23'>Then the king said, "The one says, `This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead'; and the other says, `No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one.'"</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.27'>Then the king answered and said, "Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means slay it; she is its mother."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.1'>Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon, when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father; for Hiram always loved David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.2'>And Solomon sent word to Hiram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.3'>"You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the LORD his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the LORD put them under the soles of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.4'>But now the LORD my God has given me rest on every side; there is neither adversary nor misfortune.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.5'>And so I purpose to build a house for the name of the LORD my God, as the LORD said to David my father, `Your son, whom I will set upon your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.6'>Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me; and my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set; for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sido'nians."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.7'>When Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly, and said, "Blessed be the LORD this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.8'>And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, "I have heard the message which you have sent to me; I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.9'>My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon; and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct, and I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it; and you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.10'>So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.5.11'>while Solomon gave Hiram twenty thousand cors of wheat as food for his household, and twenty thousand cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.2'>The house which King Solomon built for the LORD was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.3'>The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.4'>And he made for the house windows with recessed frames.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.5'>He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running round the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary; and he made side chambers all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.6'>The lowest story was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad; for around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.7'>When the house was built, it was with stone prepared at the quarry; so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the temple, while it was being built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.8'>The entrance for the lowest story was on the south side of the house; and one went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.9'>So he built the house, and finished it; and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.10'>He built the structure against the whole house, each story five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.11'>Now the word of the LORD came to Solomon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.12'>"Concerning this house which you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and obey my ordinances and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.14'>So Solomon built the house, and finished it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.15'>He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar; from the floor of the house to the rafters of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood; and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.16'>He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the rafters, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the most holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.17'>The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.18'>The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers; all was cedar, no stone was seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.19'>The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.20'>The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high; and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also made an altar of cedar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.21'>And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.22'>And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.23'>In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.24'>Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.25'>The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.26'>The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.27'>He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house; and the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.28'>And he overlaid the cherubim with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.29'>He carved all the walls of the house round about with carved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.30'>The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.31'>For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts formed a pentagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.32'>He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers; he overlaid them with gold, and spread gold upon the cherubim and upon the palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.33'>So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.35'>On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers; and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied upon the carved work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.36'>He built the inner court with three courses of hewn stone and one course of cedar beams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.6.37'>In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid, in the month of Ziv.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.6'>And he made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits; there was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.7'>And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment; it was finished with cedar from floor to rafters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.8'>His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh's daughter whom he had taken in marriage.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.14'>He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naph'tali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze; and he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill, for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon, and did all his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.15'>He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference; it was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers; the second pillar was the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.16'>He also made two capitals of molten bronze, to set upon the tops of the pillars; the height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.17'>Then he made two nets of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals upon the tops of the pillars; a net for the one capital, and a net for the other capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.18'>Likewise he made pomegranates; in two rows round about upon the one network, to cover the capital that was upon the top of the pillar; and he did the same with the other capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.19'>Now the capitals that were upon the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.20'>The capitals were upon the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the network; there were two hundred pomegranates, in two rows round about; and so with the other capital.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.23'>Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.24'>Under its brim were gourds, for thirty cubits, compassing the sea round about; the gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.25'>It stood upon twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.26'>Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held two thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.27'>He also made the ten stands of bronze; each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.28'>This was the construction of the stands: they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.29'>and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. Upon the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.30'>Moreover each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze; and at the four corners were supports for a laver. The supports were cast, with wreaths at the side of each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.31'>Its opening was within a crown which projected upward one cubit; its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings; and its panels were square, not round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.32'>And the four wheels were underneath the panels; the axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands; and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.34'>There were four supports at the four corners of each stand; the supports were of one piece with the stands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.35'>And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.36'>And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.37'>After this manner he made the ten stands; all of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.38'>And he made ten lavers of bronze; each laver held forty baths, each laver measured four cubits, and there was a laver for each of the ten stands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.39'>And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house; and he set the sea on the southeast corner of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.40'>Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the LORD:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.41'>the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.42'>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.43'>the ten stands, and the ten lavers upon the stands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.44'>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.45'>Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the LORD, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.46'>In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.47'>And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not found out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.48'>So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the LORD: the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.49'>the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.50'>the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the most holy place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.7.51'>Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.18'>The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with the finest gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.19'>The throne had six steps, and at the back of the throne was a calf's head, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.20'>while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.21'>All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; none were of silver, it was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.22'>For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.23'>Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.24'>And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.25'>Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.26'>And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.27'>And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephe'lah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.28'>And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Ku'e, and the king's traders received them from Ku'e at a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.10.29'>A chariot could be imported from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; and so through the king's traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.11'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.1'>Now King Solomon loved many foreign women: the daughter of Pharaoh, and Moabite, Ammonite, E'domite, Sido'nian, and Hittite women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.2'>from the nations concerning which the LORD had said to the people of Israel, "You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods"; Solomon clung to these in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.3'>He had seven hundred wives, princesses, and three hundred concubines; and his wives turned away his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.4'>For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods; and his heart was not wholly true to the LORD his God, as was the heart of David his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.5'>For Solomon went after Ash'toreth the goddess of the Sido'nians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.6'>So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and did not wholly follow the LORD, as David his father had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.7'>Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.8'>And so he did for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.9'>And the LORD was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.10'>and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods; but he did not keep what the LORD commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.11'>Therefore the LORD said to Solomon, "Since this has been your mind and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes which I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.12'>Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.14'>And the LORD raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the E'domite; he was of the royal house in Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.15'>For when David was in Edom, and Jo'ab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he slew every male in Edom</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.17'>but Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain E'domites of his father's servants, Hadad being yet a little child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.18'>They set out from Mid'ian and came to Paran, and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house, and assigned him an allowance of food, and gave him land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.19'>And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tah'penes the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.20'>And the sister of Tah'penes bore him Genu'bath his son, whom Tah'penes weaned in Pharaoh's house; and Genu'bath was in Pharaoh's house among the sons of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.21'>But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Jo'ab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, "Let me depart, that I may go to my own country."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.22'>But Pharaoh said to him, "What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country?" And he said to him, "Only let me go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.23'>God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eli'ada, who had fled from his master Hadade'zer king of Zobah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.24'>And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the slaughter by David; and they went to Damascus, and dwelt there, and made him king in Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.25'>He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing mischief as Hadad did; and he abhorred Israel, and reigned over Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.26'>Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, an E'phraimite of Zer'edah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother's name was Zeru'ah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.27'>And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.28'>The man Jerobo'am was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.29'>And at that time, when Jerobo'am went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahi'jah the Shi'lonite found him on the road. Now Ahi'jah had clad himself with a new garment; and the two of them were alone in the open country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.30'>Then Ahi'jah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.31'>And he said to Jerobo'am, "Take for yourself ten pieces; for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, `Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and will give you ten tribes</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.33'>because he has forsaken me, and worshiped Ash'toreth the goddess of the Sido'nians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and has not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my ordinances, as David his father did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.34'>Nevertheless I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand; but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.36'>Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.38'>And if you will hearken to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you, and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.39'>And I will for this afflict the descendants of David, but not for ever.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.40'>Solomon sought therefore to kill Jerobo'am; but Jerobo'am arose, and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.41'>Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the book of the acts of Solomon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.11.42'>And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.11'>And now, whereas my father laid upon you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with scorpions.'"</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.12.15'>So the king did not hearken to the people; for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the LORD that he might fulfil his word, which the LORD spoke by Ahi'jah the Shi'lonite to Jerobo'am the son of Nebat.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.14'>Then they sent to Jez'ebel, saying, "Naboth has been stoned; he is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.15'>As soon as Jez'ebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jez'ebel said to Ahab, "Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money; for Naboth is not alive, but dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.16'>And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.17'>Then the word of the LORD came to Eli'jah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>"Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Sama'ria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>And you shall say to him, `Thus says the LORD, "Have you killed, and also taken possession?"' And you shall say to him, `Thus says the LORD: "In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>Ahab said to Eli'jah, "Have you found me, O my enemy?" He answered, "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold, I will bring evil upon you; I will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>and I will make your house like the house of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, and like the house of Ba'asha the son of Ahi'jah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And of Jez'ebel the LORD also said, `The dogs shall eat Jez'ebel within the bounds of Jezreel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>Any one belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat; and any one of his who dies in the open country the birds of the air shall eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>(There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the LORD like Ahab, whom Jez'ebel his wife incited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>He did very abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the LORD cast out before the people of Israel.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And when Ahab heard those words, he rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted and lay in sackcloth, and went about dejectedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the word of the LORD came to Eli'jah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>"Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days I will bring the evil upon his house."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.22'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>For three years Syria and Israel continued without war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>But in the third year Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>And the king of Israel said to his servants, "Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>And he said to Jehosh'aphat, "Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead?" And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>And Jehosh'aphat said to the king of Israel, "Inquire first for the word of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, "Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I forbear?" And they said, "Go up; for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>But Jehosh'aphat said, "Is there not here another prophet of the LORD of whom we may inquire?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the LORD, Micai'ah the son of Imlah; but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil." And Jehosh'aphat said, "Let not the king say so."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, "Bring quickly Micai'ah the son of Imlah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>Now the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Sama'ria; and all the prophets were prophesying before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>And Zedeki'ah the son of Chena'anah made for himself horns of iron, and said, "Thus says the LORD, `With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>And all the prophets prophesied so, and said, "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>And the messenger who went to summon Micai'ah said to him, "Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king; let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>But Micai'ah said, "As the LORD lives, what the LORD says to me, that I will speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, "Micai'ah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear?" And he answered him, "Go up and triumph; the LORD will give it into the hand of the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>But the king said to him, "How many times shall I adjure you that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the LORD?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>And he said, "I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd; and the LORD said, `These have no master; let each return to his home in peace.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>And Micai'ah said, "Therefore hear the word of the LORD: I saw the LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>and the LORD said, `Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead?' And one said one thing, and another said another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>Then a spirit came forward and stood before the LORD, saying, `I will entice him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>And the LORD said to him, `By what means?' And he said, `I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets.' And he said, `You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go forth and do so.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Now therefore behold, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the LORD has spoken evil concerning you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>Then Zedeki'ah the son of Chena'anah came near and struck Micai'ah on the cheek, and said, "How did the Spirit of the LORD go from me to speak to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.25'>And Micai'ah said, "Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.26'>And the king of Israel said, "Seize Micai'ah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Jo'ash the king's son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.27'>and say, `Thus says the king, "Put this fellow in prison, and feed him with scant fare of bread and water, until I come in peace."'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.28'>And Micai'ah said, "If you return in peace, the LORD has not spoken by me." And he said, "Hear, all you peoples!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.29'>So the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.30'>And the king of Israel said to Jehosh'aphat, "I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes." And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.31'>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, "Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.32'>And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehosh'aphat, they said, "It is surely the king of Israel." So they turned to fight against him; and Jehosh'aphat cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.33'>And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.34'>But a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate; therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, "Turn about, and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.35'>And the battle grew hot that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died; and the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.36'>And about sunset a cry went through the army, "Every man to his city, and every man to his country!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.37'>So the king died, and was brought to Sama'ria; and they buried the king in Sama'ria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.38'>And they washed the chariot by the pool of Sama'ria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the harlots washed themselves in it, according to the word of the LORD which he had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.39'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.40'>So Ahab slept with his fathers; and Ahazi'ah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.41'>Jehosh'aphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.42'>Jehosh'aphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azu'bah the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.43'>He walked in all the way of Asa his father; he did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the LORD; yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.44'>Jehosh'aphat also made peace with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.45'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehosh'aphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.46'>And the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa, he exterminated from the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.47'>There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.48'>Jehosh'aphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold; but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at E'zion-ge'ber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.49'>Then Ahazi'ah the son of Ahab said to Jehosh'aphat, "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships," but Jehosh'aphat was not willing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.50'>And Jehosh'aphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father; and Jeho'ram his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.51'>Ahazi'ah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Sama'ria in the seventeenth year of Jehosh'aphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.52'>He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.53'>He served Ba'al and worshiped him, and provoked the LORD, the God of Israel, to anger in every way that his father had done.</verse>
