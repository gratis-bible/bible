      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <title>And all Israel in the days of Zerub'babel and in the days of Nehemi'ah gave the daily portions for the singers and the gatekeepers; and they set apart that which was for the Levites; and the Levites set apart that which was for the sons of Aaron.</title>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>In the days of Ahasu-e'rus, the Ahasu-e'rus who reigned from India to Ethiopia over one hundred and twenty-seven provinces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>in those days when King Ahasu-e'rus sat on his royal throne in Susa the capital,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>in the third year of his reign he gave a banquet for all his princes and servants, the army chiefs of Persia and Media and the nobles and governors of the provinces being before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>while he showed the riches of his royal glory and the splendor and pomp of his majesty for many days, a hundred and eighty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And when these days were completed, the king gave for all the people present in Susa the capital, both great and small, a banquet lasting for seven days, in the court of the garden of the king's palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>There were white cotton curtains and blue hangings caught up with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and marble pillars, and also couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and precious stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>Drinks were served in golden goblets, goblets of different kinds, and the royal wine was lavished according to the bounty of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And drinking was according to the law, no one was compelled; for the king had given orders to all the officials of his palace to do as every man desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Queen Vashti also gave a banquet for the women in the palace which belonged to King Ahasu-e'rus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehu'man, Biztha, Harbo'na, Bigtha and Abag'tha, Zethar and Carkas, the seven eunuchs who served King Ahasu-e'rus as chamberlains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>to bring Queen Vashti before the king with her royal crown, in order to show the peoples and the princes her beauty; for she was fair to behold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's command conveyed by the eunuchs. At this the king was enraged, and his anger burned within him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Then the king said to the wise men who knew the times-- for this was the king's procedure toward all who were versed in law and judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>the men next to him being Carshe'na, Shethar, Adma'tha, Tarshish, Meres, Marse'na, and Memu'can, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king's face, and sat first in the kingdom--:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>"According to the law, what is to be done to Queen Vashti, because she has not performed the command of King Ahasu-e'rus conveyed by the eunuchs?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>Then Memu'can said in presence of the king and the princes, "Not only to the king has Queen Vashti done wrong, but also to all the princes and all the peoples who are in all the provinces of King Ahasu-e'rus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For this deed of the queen will be made known to all women, causing them to look with contempt upon their husbands, since they will say, `King Ahasu-e'rus commanded Queen Vashti to be brought before him, and she did not come.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>This very day the ladies of Persia and Media who have heard of the queen's behavior will be telling it to all the king's princes, and there will be contempt and wrath in plenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If it please the king, let a royal order go forth from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes so that it may not be altered, that Vashti is to come no more before King Ahasu-e'rus; and let the king give her royal position to another who is better than she.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>So when the decree made by the king is proclaimed throughout all his kingdom, vast as it is, all women will give honor to their husbands, high and low."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>This advice pleased the king and the princes, and the king did as Memu'can proposed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>he sent letters to all the royal provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, that every man be lord in his own house and speak according to the language of his people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, when the anger of King Ahasu-e'rus had abated, he remembered Vashti and what she had done and what had been decreed against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>Then the king's servants who attended him said, "Let beautiful young virgins be sought out for the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom to gather all the beautiful young virgins to the harem in Susa the capital, under custody of Hegai the king's eunuch who is in charge of the women; let their ointments be given them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>And let the maiden who pleases the king be queen instead of Vashti." This pleased the king, and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>Now there was a Jew in Susa the capital whose name was Mor'decai, the son of Ja'ir, son of Shim'e-i, son of Kish, a Benjaminite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>who had been carried away from Jerusalem among the captives carried away with Jeconi'ah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnez'zar king of Babylon had carried away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>He had brought up Hadas'sah, that is Esther, the daughter of his uncle, for she had neither father nor mother; the maiden was beautiful and lovely, and when her father and her mother died, Mor'decai adopted her as his own daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>So when the king's order and his edict were proclaimed, and when many maidens were gathered in Susa the capital in custody of Hegai, Esther also was taken into the king's palace and put in custody of Hegai who had charge of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And the maiden pleased him and won his favor; and he quickly provided her with her ointments and her portion of food, and with seven chosen maids from the king's palace, and advanced her and her maids to the best place in the harem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>Esther had not made known her people or kindred, for Mor'decai had charged her not to make it known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And every day Mor'decai walked in front of the court of the harem, to learn how Esther was and how she fared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now when the turn came for each maiden to go in to King Ahasu-e'rus, after being twelve months under the regulations for the women, since this was the regular period of their beautifying, six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and ointments for women--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>when the maiden went in to the king in this way she was given whatever she desired to take with her from the harem to the king's palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>In the evening she went, and in the morning she came back to the second harem in custody of Sha-ash'gaz the king's eunuch who was in charge of the concubines; she did not go in to the king again, unless the king delighted in her and she was summoned by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>When the turn came for Esther the daughter of Ab'ihail the uncle of Mor'decai, who had adopted her as his own daughter, to go in to the king, she asked for nothing except what Hegai the king's eunuch, who had charge of the women, advised. Now Esther found favor in the eyes of all who saw her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>And when Esther was taken to King Ahasu-e'rus into his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month of Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>the king loved Esther more than all the women, and she found grace and favor in his sight more than all the virgins, so that he set the royal crown on her head and made her queen instead of Vashti.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>Then the king gave a great banquet to all his princes and servants; it was Esther's banquet. He also granted a remission of taxes to the provinces, and gave gifts with royal liberality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>When the virgins were gathered together the second time, Mor'decai was sitting at the king's gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Now Esther had not made known her kindred or her people, as Mor'decai had charged her; for Esther obeyed Mor'decai just as when she was brought up by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>And in those days, as Mor'decai was sitting at the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, became angry and sought to lay hands on King Ahasu-e'rus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And this came to the knowledge of Mor'decai, and he told it to Queen Esther, and Esther told the king in the name of Mor'decai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>When the affair was investigated and found to be so, the men were both hanged on the gallows. And it was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things King Ahasu-e'rus promoted Haman the Ag'agite, the son of Hammeda'tha, and advanced him and set his seat above all the princes who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all the king's servants who were at the king's gate bowed down and did obeisance to Haman; for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mor'decai did not bow down or do obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>Then the king's servants who were at the king's gate said to Mor'decai, "Why do you transgress the king's command?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>And when they spoke to him day after day and he would not listen to them, they told Haman, in order to see whether Mor'decai's words would avail; for he had told them that he was a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And when Haman saw that Mor'decai did not bow down or do obeisance to him, Haman was filled with fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>But he disdained to lay hands on Mor'decai alone. So, as they had made known to him the people of Mor'decai, Haman sought to destroy all the Jews, the people of Mor'decai, throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasu-e'rus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month, which is the month of Nisan, in the twelfth year of King Ahasu-e'rus, they cast Pur, that is the lot, before Haman day after day; and they cast it month after month till the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>Then Haman said to King Ahasu-e'rus, "There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples in all the provinces of your kingdom; their laws are different from those of every other people, and they do not keep the king's laws, so that it is not for the king's profit to tolerate them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it please the king, let it be decreed that they be destroyed, and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver into the hands of those who have charge of the king's business, that they may put it into the king's treasuries."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>So the king took his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Haman the Ag'agite, the son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And the king said to Haman, "The money is given to you, the people also, to do with them as it seems good to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>Then the king's secretaries were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and an edict, according to all that Haman commanded, was written to the king's satraps and to the governors over all the provinces and to the princes of all the peoples, to every province in its own script and every people in its own language; it was written in the name of King Ahasu-e'rus and sealed with the king's ring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>Letters were sent by couriers to all the king's provinces, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate all Jews, young and old, women and children, in one day, the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, and to plunder their goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>A copy of the document was to be issued as a decree in every province by proclamation to all the peoples to be ready for that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The couriers went in haste by order of the king, and the decree was issued in Susa the capital. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city of Susa was perplexed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>When Mor'decai learned all that had been done, Mor'decai rent his clothes and put on sackcloth and ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, wailing with a loud and bitter cry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>he went up to the entrance of the king's gate, for no one might enter the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in every province, wherever the king's command and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, with fasting and weeping and lamenting, and most of them lay in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>When Esther's maids and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was deeply distressed; she sent garments to clothe Mor'decai, so that he might take off his sackcloth, but he would not accept them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>Then Esther called for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, who had been appointed to attend her, and ordered him to go to Mor'decai to learn what this was and why it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>Hathach went out to Mor'decai in the open square of the city in front of the king's gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>and Mor'decai told him all that had happened to him, and the exact sum of money that Haman had promised to pay into the king's treasuries for the destruction of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>Mor'decai also gave him a copy of the written decree issued in Susa for their destruction, that he might show it to Esther and explain it to her and charge her to go to the king to make supplication to him and entreat him for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Hathach went and told Esther what Mor'decai had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>Then Esther spoke to Hathach and gave him a message for Mor'decai, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>"All the king's servants and the people of the king's provinces know that if any man or woman goes to the king inside the inner court without being called, there is but one law; all alike are to be put to death, except the one to whom the king holds out the golden scepter that he may live. And I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And they told Mor'decai what Esther had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>Then Mor'decai told them to return answer to Esther, "Think not that in the king's palace you will escape any more than all the other Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>For if you keep silence at such a time as this, relief and deliverance will rise for the Jews from another quarter, but you and your father's house will perish. And who knows whether you have not come to the kingdom for such a time as this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>Then Esther told them to reply to Mor'decai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>"Go, gather all the Jews to be found in Susa, and hold a fast on my behalf, and neither eat nor drink for three days, night or day. I and my maids will also fast as you do. Then I will go to the king, though it is against the law; and if I perish, I perish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>Mor'decai then went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>On the third day Esther put on her royal robes and stood in the inner court of the king's palace, opposite the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne inside the palace opposite the entrance to the palace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>and when the king saw Queen Esther standing in the court, she found favor in his sight and he held out to Esther the golden scepter that was in his hand. Then Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>And the king said to her, "What is it, Queen Esther? What is your request? It shall be given you, even to the half of my kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>And Esther said, "If it please the king, let the king and Haman come this day to a dinner that I have prepared for the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>Then said the king, "Bring Haman quickly, that we may do as Esther desires." So the king and Haman came to the dinner that Esther had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And as they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, "What is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>But Esther said, "My petition and my request is:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>If I have found favor in the sight of the king, and if it please the king to grant my petition and fulfil my request, let the king and Haman come tomorrow to the dinner which I will prepare for them, and tomorrow I will do as the king has said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>And Haman went out that day joyful and glad of heart. But when Haman saw Mor'decai in the king's gate, that he neither rose nor trembled before him, he was filled with wrath against Mor'decai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself, and went home; and he sent and fetched his friends and his wife Zeresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>And Haman recounted to them the splendor of his riches, the number of his sons, all the promotions with which the king had honored him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and the servants of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>And Haman added, "Even Queen Esther let no one come with the king to the banquet she prepared but myself. And tomorrow also I am invited by her together with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>Yet all this does me no good, so long as I see Mor'decai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>Then his wife Zeresh and all his friends said to him, "Let a gallows fifty cubits high be made, and in the morning tell the king to have Mor'decai hanged upon it; then go merrily with the king to the dinner." This counsel pleased Haman, and he had the gallows made.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>On that night the king could not sleep; and he gave orders to bring the book of memorable deeds, the chronicles, and they were read before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>And it was found written how Mor'decai had told about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs, who guarded the threshold, and who had sought to lay hands upon King Ahasu-e'rus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.3'>And the king said, "What honor or dignity has been bestowed on Mor'decai for this?" The king's servants who attended him said, "Nothing has been done for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.4'>And the king said, "Who is in the court?" Now Haman had just entered the outer court of the king's palace to speak to the king about having Mor'decai hanged on the gallows that he had prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.5'>So the king's servants told him, "Haman is there, standing in the court." And the king said, "Let him come in."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.6'>So Haman came in, and the king said to him, "What shall be done to the man whom the king delights to honor?" And Haman said to himself, "Whom would the king delight to honor more than me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.7'>and Haman said to the king, "For the man whom the king delights to honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.8'>let royal robes be brought, which the king has worn, and the horse which the king has ridden, and on whose head a royal crown is set;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.9'>and let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble princes; let him array the man whom the king delights to honor, and let him conduct the man on horseback through the open square of the city, proclaiming before him: `Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.10'>Then the king said to Haman, "Make haste, take the robes and the horse, as you have said, and do so to Mor'decai the Jew who sits at the king's gate. Leave out nothing that you have mentioned."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.11'>So Haman took the robes and the horse, and he arrayed Mor'decai and made him ride through the open square of the city, proclaiming, "Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delights to honor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.12'>Then Mor'decai returned to the king's gate. But Haman hurried to his house, mourning and with his head covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.13'>And Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had befallen him. Then his wise men and his wife Zeresh said to him, "If Mor'decai, before whom you have begun to fall, is of the Jewish people, you will not prevail against him but will surely fall before him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.14'>While they were yet talking with him, the king's eunuchs arrived and brought Haman in haste to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.7'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.1'>So the king and Haman went in to feast with Queen Esther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.2'>And on the second day, as they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, "What is your petition, Queen Esther? It shall be granted you. And what is your request? Even to the half of my kingdom, it shall be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.3'>Then Queen Esther answered, "If I have found favor in your sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.4'>For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be slain, and to be annihilated. If we had been sold merely as slaves, men and women, I would have held my peace; for our affliction is not to be compared with the loss to the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.5'>Then King Ahasu-e'rus said to Queen Esther, "Who is he, and where is he, that would presume to do this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.6'>And Esther said, "A foe and enemy! This wicked Haman!" Then Haman was in terror before the king and the queen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.7'>And the king rose from the feast in wrath and went into the palace garden; but Haman stayed to beg his life from Queen Esther, for he saw that evil was determined against him by the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.8'>And the king returned from the palace garden to the place where they were drinking wine, as Haman was falling on the couch where Esther was; and the king said, "Will he even assault the queen in my presence, in my own house?" As the words left the mouth of the king, they covered Haman's face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.9'>Then said Harbo'na, one of the eunuchs in attendance on the king, "Moreover, the gallows which Haman has prepared for Mor'decai, whose word saved the king, is standing in Haman's house, fifty cubits high."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.7.10'>And the king said, "Hang him on that." So they hanged Haman on the gallows which he had prepared for Mor'decai. Then the anger of the king abated.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.8'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.1'>On that day King Ahasu-e'rus gave to Queen Esther the house of Haman, the enemy of the Jews. And Mor'decai came before the king, for Esther had told what he was to her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.2'>and the king took off his signet ring, which he had taken from Haman, and gave it to Mor'decai. And Esther set Mor'decai over the house of Haman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.3'>Then Esther spoke again to the king; she fell at his feet and besought him with tears to avert the evil design of Haman the Ag'agite and the plot which he had devised against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.4'>And the king held out the golden scepter to Esther,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.5'>and Esther rose and stood before the king. And she said, "If it please the king, and if I have found favor in his sight, and if the thing seem right before the king, and I be pleasing in his eyes, let an order be written to revoke the letters devised by Haman the Ag'agite, the son of Hammeda'tha, which he wrote to destroy the Jews who are in all the provinces of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.6'>For how can I endure to see the calamity that is coming to my people? Or how can I endure to see the destruction of my kindred?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.7'>Then King Ahasu-e'rus said to Queen Esther and to Mor'decai the Jew, "Behold, I have given Esther the house of Haman, and they have hanged him on the gallows, because he would lay hands on the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.8'>And you may write as you please with regard to the Jews, in the name of the king, and seal it with the king's ring; for an edict written in the name of the king and sealed with the king's ring cannot be revoked."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.9'>The king's secretaries were summoned at that time, in the third month, which is the month of Sivan, on the twenty-third day; and an edict was written according to all that Mor'decai commanded concerning the Jews to the satraps and the governors and the princes of the provinces from India to Ethiopia, a hundred and twenty-seven provinces, to every province in its own script and to every people in its own language, and also to the Jews in their script and their language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.10'>The writing was in the name of King Ahasu-e'rus and sealed with the king's ring, and letters were sent by mounted couriers riding on swift horses that were used in the king's service, bred from the royal stud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.11'>By these the king allowed the Jews who were in every city to gather and defend their lives, to destroy, to slay, and to annihilate any armed force of any people or province that might attack them, with their children and women, and to plunder their goods,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.12'>upon one day throughout all the provinces of King Ahasu-e'rus, on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.13'>A copy of what was written was to be issued as a decree in every province, and by proclamation to all peoples, and the Jews were to be ready on that day to avenge themselves upon their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.14'>So the couriers, mounted on their swift horses that were used in the king's service, rode out in haste, urged by the king's command; and the decree was issued in Susa the capital.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.15'>Then Mor'decai went out from the presence of the king in royal robes of blue and white, with a great golden crown and a mantle of fine linen and purple, while the city of Susa shouted and rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.16'>The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.8.17'>And in every province and in every city, wherever the king's command and his edict came, there was gladness and joy among the Jews, a feast and a holiday. And many from the peoples of the country declared themselves Jews, for the fear of the Jews had fallen upon them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.9'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.1'>Now in the twelfth month, which is the month of Adar, on the thirteenth day of the same, when the king's command and edict were about to be executed, on the very day when the enemies of the Jews hoped to get the mastery over them, but which had been changed to a day when the Jews should get the mastery over their foes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.2'>the Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the provinces of King Ahasu-e'rus to lay hands on such as sought their hurt. And no one could make a stand against them, for the fear of them had fallen upon all peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.3'>All the princes of the provinces and the satraps and the governors and the royal officials also helped the Jews, for the fear of Mor'decai had fallen upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.4'>For Mor'decai was great in the king's house, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces; for the man Mor'decai grew more and more powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.5'>So the Jews smote all their enemies with the sword, slaughtering, and destroying them, and did as they pleased to those who hated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.6'>In Susa the capital itself the Jews slew and destroyed five hundred men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.7'>and also slew Par-shan-da'tha and Dalphon and Aspa'tha</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.8'>and Pora'tha and Ada'lia and Arida'tha</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.9'>and Parmash'ta and Ar'isai and Ar'idai and Vaiza'tha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.10'>the ten sons of Haman the son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of the Jews; but they laid no hand on the plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.11'>That very day the number of those slain in Susa the capital was reported to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.12'>And the king said to Queen Esther, "In Susa the capital the Jews have slain five hundred men and also the ten sons of Haman. What then have they done in the rest of the king's provinces! Now what is your petition? It shall be granted you. And what further is your request? It shall be fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.13'>And Esther said, "If it please the king, let the Jews who are in Susa be allowed tomorrow also to do according to this day's edict. And let the ten sons of Haman be hanged on the gallows."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.14'>So the king commanded this to be done; a decree was issued in Susa, and the ten sons of Haman were hanged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.15'>The Jews who were in Susa gathered also on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar and they slew three hundred men in Susa; but they laid no hands on the plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.16'>Now the other Jews who were in the king's provinces also gathered to defend their lives, and got relief from their enemies, and slew seventy-five thousand of those who hated them; but they laid no hands on the plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.17'>This was on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested and made that a day of feasting and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.18'>But the Jews who were in Susa gathered on the thirteenth day and on the fourteenth, and rested on the fifteenth day, making that a day of feasting and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.19'>Therefore the Jews of the villages, who live in the open towns, hold the fourteenth day of the month of Adar as a day for gladness and feasting and holiday-making, and a day on which they send choice portions to one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.20'>And Mor'decai recorded these things, and sent letters to all the Jews who were in all the provinces of King Ahasu-e'rus, both near and far,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.21'>enjoining them that they should keep the fourteenth day of the month Adar and also the fifteenth day of the same, year by year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.22'>as the days on which the Jews got relief from their enemies, and as the month that had been turned for them from sorrow into gladness and from mourning into a holiday; that they should make them days of feasting and gladness, days for sending choice portions to one another and gifts to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.23'>So the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as Mor'decai had written to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.24'>For Haman the Ag'agite, the son of Hammeda'tha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to crush and destroy them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.25'>but when Esther came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his wicked plot which he had devised against the Jews should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.26'>Therefore they called these days Purim, after the term Pur. And therefore, because of all that was written in this letter, and of what they had faced in this matter, and of what had befallen them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.27'>the Jews ordained and took it upon themselves and their descendants and all who joined them, that without fail they would keep these two days according to what was written and at the time appointed every year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.28'>that these days should be remembered and kept throughout every generation, in every family, province, and city, and that these days of Purim should never fall into disuse among the Jews, nor should the commemoration of these days cease among their descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.29'>Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Ab'ihail, and Mor'decai the Jew gave full written authority, confirming this second letter about Purim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.30'>Letters were sent to all the Jews, to the hundred and twenty-seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasu-e'rus, in words of peace and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.31'>that these days of Purim should be observed at their appointed seasons, as Mor'decai the Jew and Queen Esther enjoined upon the Jews, and as they had laid down for themselves and for their descendants, with regard to their fasts and their lamenting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.9.32'>The command of Queen Esther fixed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.10'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.1'>King Ahasu-e'rus laid tribute on the land and on the coastlands of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.2'>And all the acts of his power and might, and the full account of the high honor of Mor'decai, to which the king advanced him, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.10.3'>For Mor'decai the Jew was next in rank to King Ahasu-e'rus, and he was great among the Jews and popular with the multitude of his brethren, for he sought the welfare of his people and spoke peace to all his people.</verse>
