      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <title>O LORD the God of Israel, thou art just, for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as at this day. Behold, we are before thee in our guilt, for none can stand before thee because of this."</title>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemi'ah the son of Hacali'ah.  Now it happened in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Susa the capital,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hana'ni, one of my brethren, came with certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that survived, who had escaped exile, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said to me, "The survivors there in the province who escaped exile are in great trouble and shame; the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates are destroyed by fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>When I heard these words I sat down and wept, and mourned for days; and I continued fasting and praying before the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>And I said, "O LORD God of heaven, the great and terrible God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love him and keep his commandments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>let thy ear be attentive, and thy eyes open, to hear the prayer of thy servant which I now pray before thee day and night for the people of Israel thy servants, confessing the sins of the people of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father's house have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have acted very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, the statutes, and the ordinances which thou didst command thy servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember the word which thou didst command thy servant Moses, saying, `If you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the peoples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>but if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, though your dispersed be under the farthest skies, I will gather them thence and bring them to the place which I have chosen, to make my name dwell there.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>They are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power and by thy strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>O Lord, let thy ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants who delight to fear thy name; and give success to thy servant today, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man."  Now I was cupbearer to the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of King Ar-ta-xerx'es, when wine was before him, I took up the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had not been sad in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>And the king said to me, "Why is your face sad, seeing you are not sick? This is nothing else but sadness of the heart." Then I was very much afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>I said to the king, "Let the king live for ever! Why should not my face be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lies waste, and its gates have been destroyed by fire?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said to me, "For what do you make request?" So I prayed to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, that you send me to Judah, to the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may rebuild it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said to me (the queen sitting beside him), "How long will you be gone, and when will you return?" So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>And I said to the king, "If it pleases the king, let letters be given me to the governors of the province Beyond the River, that they may let me pass through until I come to Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the fortress of the temple, and for the wall of the city, and for the house which I shall occupy." And the king granted me what I asked, for the good hand of my God was upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I came to the governors of the province Beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>But when Sanbal'lat the Hor'onite and Tobi'ah the servant, the Ammonite, heard this, it displeased them greatly that some one had come to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Jerusalem and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>Then I arose in the night, I and a few men with me; and I told no one what my God had put into my heart to do for Jerusalem. There was no beast with me but the beast on which I rode.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>I went out by night by the Valley Gate to the Jackal's Well and to the Dung Gate, and I inspected the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down and its gates which had been destroyed by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool; but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then I went up in the night by the valley and inspected the wall; and I turned back and entered by the Valley Gate, and so returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the officials did not know where I had gone or what I was doing; and I had not yet told the Jews, the priests, the nobles, the officials, and the rest that were to do the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then I said to them, "You see the trouble we are in, how Jerusalem lies in ruins with its gates burned. Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may no longer suffer disgrace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>And I told them of the hand of my God which had been upon me for good, and also of the words which the king had spoken to me. And they said, "Let us rise up and build." So they strengthened their hands for the good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanbal'lat the Hor'onite and Tobi'ah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab heard of it, they derided us and despised us and said, "What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then I replied to them, "The God of heaven will make us prosper, and we his servants will arise and build; but you have no portion or right or memorial in Jerusalem."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eli'ashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests and they built the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and set its doors; they consecrated it as far as the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Tower of Hanan'el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>And next to him the men of Jericho built. And next to them Zaccur the son of Imri built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.3'>And the sons of Hassena'ah built the Fish Gate; they laid its beams and set its doors, its bolts, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.4'>And next to them Mer'emoth the son of Uri'ah, son of Hakkoz repaired. And next to them Meshul'lam the son of Berechi'ah, son of Meshez'abel repaired. And next to them Zadok the son of Ba'ana repaired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.5'>And next to them the Teko'ites repaired; but their nobles did not put their necks to the work of their Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.6'>And Joi'ada the son of Pase'ah and Meshul'lam the son of Besodei'ah repaired the Old Gate; they laid its beams and set its doors, its bolts, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.7'>And next to them repaired Melati'ah the Gib'eonite and Jadon the Mero'nothite, the men of Gibeon and of Mizpah, who were under the jurisdiction of the governor of the province Beyond the River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.8'>Next to them Uz'ziel the son of Harhai'ah, goldsmiths, repaired. Next to him Hanani'ah, one of the perfumers, repaired; and they restored Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.9'>Next to them Rephai'ah the son of Hur, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, repaired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.10'>Next to them Jedai'ah the son of Haru'maph repaired opposite his house; and next to him Hattush the son of Hashabnei'ah repaired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.11'>Malchi'jah the son of Harim and Hasshub the son of Pa'hath-mo'ab repaired another section and the Tower of the Ovens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.12'>Next to him Shallum the son of Hallo'hesh, ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, repaired, he and his daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.13'>Hanun and the inhabitants of Zano'ah repaired the Valley Gate; they rebuilt it and set its doors, its bolts, and its bars, and repaired a thousand cubits of the wall, as far as the Dung Gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.14'>Malchi'jah the son of Rechab, ruler of the district of Beth-hacche'rem, repaired the Dung Gate; he rebuilt it and set its doors, its bolts, and its bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.15'>And Shallum the son of Colho'zeh, ruler of the district of Mizpah, repaired the Fountain Gate; he rebuilt it and covered it and set its doors, its bolts, and its bars; and he built the wall of the Pool of Shelah of the king's garden, as far as the stairs that go down from the City of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.16'>After him Nehemi'ah the son of Azbuk, ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, repaired to a point opposite the sepulchres of David, to the artificial pool, and to the house of the mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.17'>After him the Levites repaired: Rehum the son of Bani; next to him Hashabi'ah, ruler of half the district of Kei'lah, repaired for his district.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.3.32'>And between the upper chamber of the corner and the Sheep Gate the goldsmiths and the merchants repaired.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>Now when Sanbal'lat heard that we were building the wall, he was angry and greatly enraged, and he ridiculed the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he said in the presence of his brethren and of the army of Sama'ria, "What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they restore things? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish up in a day? Will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, and burned ones at that?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Tobi'ah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, "Yes, what they are building-- if a fox goes up on it he will break down their stone wall!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, O our God, for we are despised; turn back their taunt upon their own heads, and give them up to be plundered in a land where they are captives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>Do not cover their guilt, and let not their sin be blotted out from thy sight; for they have provoked thee to anger before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together to half its height. For the people had a mind to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>But when Sanbal'lat and Tobi'ah and the Arabs and the Ammonites and the Ash'dodites heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and that the breaches were beginning to be closed, they were very angry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and they all plotted together to come and fight against Jerusalem and to cause confusion in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>And we prayed to our God, and set a guard as a protection against them day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>But Judah said, "The strength of the burden-bearers is failing, and there is much rubbish; we are not able to work on the wall."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our enemies said, "They will not know or see till we come into the midst of them and kill them and stop the work."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>When the Jews who lived by them came they said to us ten times, "From all the places where they live they will come up against us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>So in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in open places, I stationed the people according to their families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and arose, and said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, "Do not be afraid of them. Remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>When our enemies heard that it was known to us and that God had frustrated their plan, we all returned to the wall, each to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>From that day on, half of my servants worked on construction, and half held the spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail; and the leaders stood behind all the house of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>who were building on the wall. Those who carried burdens were laden in such a way that each with one hand labored on the work and with the other held his weapon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>And each of the builders had his sword girded at his side while he built. The man who sounded the trumpet was beside me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said to the nobles and to the officials and to the rest of the people, "The work is great and widely spread, and we are separated on the wall, far from one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>In the place where you hear the sound of the trumpet, rally to us there. Our God will fight for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we labored at the work, and half of them held the spears from the break of dawn till the stars came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>I also said to the people at that time, "Let every man and his servant pass the night within Jerusalem, that they may be a guard for us by night and may labor by day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I nor my brethren nor my servants nor the men of the guard who followed me, none of us took off our clothes; each kept his weapon in his hand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Now there arose a great outcry of the people and of their wives against their Jewish brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were those who said, "With our sons and our daughters, we are many; let us get grain, that we may eat and keep alive."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>There were also those who said, "We are mortgaging our fields, our vineyards, and our houses to get grain because of the famine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>And there were those who said, "We have borrowed money for the king's tax upon our fields and our vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children are as their children; yet we are forcing our sons and our daughters to be slaves, and some of our daughters have already been enslaved; but it is not in our power to help it, for other men have our fields and our vineyards."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>I was very angry when I heard their outcry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>I took counsel with myself, and I brought charges against the nobles and the officials. I said to them, "You are exacting interest, each from his brother." And I held a great assembly against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>and said to them, "We, as far as we are able, have bought back our Jewish brethren who have been sold to the nations; but you even sell your brethren that they may be sold to us!" They were silent, and could not find a word to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>So I said, "The thing that you are doing is not good. Ought you not to walk in the fear of our God to prevent the taunts of the nations our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>Moreover I and my brethren and my servants are lending them money and grain. Let us leave off this interest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Return to them this very day their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and the hundredth of money, grain, wine, and oil which you have been exacting of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then they said, "We will restore these and require nothing from them. We will do as you say." And I called the priests, and took an oath of them to do as they had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>I also shook out my lap and said, "So may God shake out every man from his house and from his labor who does not perform this promise. So may he be shaken out and emptied." And all the assembly said "Amen" and praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of Ar-ta-xerx'es the king, twelve years, neither I nor my brethren ate the food allowance of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>The former governors who were before me laid heavy burdens upon the people, and took from them food and wine, besides forty shekels of silver. Even their servants lorded it over the people. But I did not do so, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>I also held to the work on this wall, and acquired no land; and all my servants were gathered there for the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>Moreover there were at my table a hundred and fifty men, Jews and officials, besides those who came to us from the nations which were about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; fowls likewise were prepared for me, and every ten days skins of wine in abundance; yet with all this I did not demand the food allowance of the governor, because the servitude was heavy upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember for my good, O my God, all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now when it was reported to Sanbal'lat and Tobi'ah and to Geshem the Arab and to the rest of our enemies that I had built the wall and that there was no breach left in it (although up to that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>Sanbal'lat and Geshem sent to me, saying, "Come and let us meet together in one of the villages in the plain of Ono." But they intended to do me harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers to them, saying, "I am doing a great work and I cannot come down. Why should the work stop while I leave it and come down to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>And they sent to me four times in this way and I answered them in the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>In the same way Sanbal'lat for the fifth time sent his servant to me with an open letter in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>In it was written, "It is reported among the nations, and Geshem also says it, that you and the Jews intend to rebel; that is why you are building the wall; and you wish to become their king, according to this report.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And you have also set up prophets to proclaim concerning you in Jerusalem, `There is a king in Judah.' And now it will be reported to the king according to these words. So now come, and let us take counsel together."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent to him, saying, "No such things as you say have been done, for you are inventing them out of your own mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For they all wanted to frighten us, thinking, "Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done." But now, O God, strengthen thou my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>Now when I went into the house of Shemai'ah the son of Delai'ah, son of Mehet'abel, who was shut up, he said, "Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple; for they are coming to kill you, at night they are coming to kill you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>But I said, "Should such a man as I flee? And what man such as I could go into the temple and live? I will not go in."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And I understood, and saw that God had not sent him, but he had pronounced the prophecy against me because Tobi'ah and Sanbal'lat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>For this purpose he was hired, that I should be afraid and act in this way and sin, and so they could give me an evil name, in order to taunt me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>Remember Tobi'ah and Sanbal'lat, O my God, according to these things that they did, and also the prophetess No-adi'ah and the rest of the prophets who wanted to make me afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, in fifty-two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And when all our enemies heard of it, all the nations round about us were afraid and fell greatly in their own esteem; for they perceived that this work had been accomplished with the help of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters to Tobi'ah, and Tobi'ah's letters came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For many in Judah were bound by oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecani'ah the son of Arah: and his son Jehoha'nan had taken the daughter of Meshul'lam the son of Berechi'ah as his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Also they spoke of his good deeds in my presence, and reported my words to him. And Tobi'ah sent letters to make me afraid.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>Now when the wall had been built and I had set up the doors, and the gatekeepers, the singers, and the Levites had been appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>I gave my brother Hana'ni and Hanani'ah the governor of the castle charge over Jerusalem, for he was a more faithful and God-fearing man than many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.3'>And I said to them, "Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun is hot; and while they are still standing guard let them shut and bar the doors. Appoint guards from among the inhabitants of Jerusalem, each to his station and each opposite his own house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.4'>The city was wide and large, but the people within it were few and no houses had been built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.5'>Then God put it into my mind to assemble the nobles and the officials and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of those who came up at the first, and I found written in it:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days I saw in Judah men treading wine presses on the sabbath, and bringing in heaps of grain and loading them on asses; and also wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day; and I warned them on the day when they sold food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>Men of Tyre also, who lived in the city, brought in fish and all kinds of wares and sold them on the sabbath to the people of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>Then I remonstrated with the nobles of Judah and said to them, "What is this evil thing which you are doing, profaning the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not your fathers act in this way, and did not our God bring all this evil on us and on this city? Yet you bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>When it began to be dark at the gates of Jerusalem before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut and gave orders that they should not be opened until after the sabbath. And I set some of my servants over the gates, that no burden might be brought in on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>Then the merchants and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>But I warned them and said to them, "Why do you lodge before the wall? If you do so again I will lay hands on you." From that time on they did not come on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves and come and guard the gates, to keep the sabbath day holy. Remember this also in my favor, O my God, and spare me according to the greatness of thy steadfast love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days also I saw the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>and half of their children spoke the language of Ashdod, and they could not speak the language of Judah, but the language of each people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I contended with them and cursed them and beat some of them and pulled out their hair; and I made them take oath in the name of God, saying, "You shall not give your daughters to their sons, or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin on account of such women? Among the many nations there was no king like him, and he was beloved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel; nevertheless foreign women made even him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Shall we then listen to you and do all this great evil and act treacherously against our God by marrying foreign women?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And one of the sons of Jehoi'ada, the son of Eli'ashib the high priest, was the son-in-law of Sanbal'lat the Hor'onite; therefore I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>Thus I cleansed them from everything foreign, and I established the duties of the priests and Levites, each in his work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>and I provided for the wood offering, at appointed times, and for the first fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</verse>
