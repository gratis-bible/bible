      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <title>The command of Queen Esther fixed these practices of Purim, and it was recorded in writing.</title>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God, and turned away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>There were born to him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>He had seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and very many servants; so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each on his day; and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and sanctify them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all; for Job said, "It may be that my sons have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts." Thus Job did continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>The LORD said to Satan, "Whence have you come?" Satan answered the LORD, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered the LORD, "Does Job fear God for nought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast thou not put a hedge about him and his house and all that he has, on every side? Thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he has, and he will curse thee to thy face."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, all that he has is in your power; only upon himself do not put forth your hand." So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>and there came a messenger to Job, and said, "The oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and the Sabe'ans fell upon them and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "The Chalde'ans formed three companies, and made a raid upon the camels and took them, and slew the servants with the edge of the sword; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was yet speaking, there came another, and said, "Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness, and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead; and I alone have escaped to tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell upon the ground, and worshiped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>And he said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return; the LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And the LORD said to Satan, "Whence have you come?" Satan answered the LORD, "From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And the LORD said to Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you moved me against him, to destroy him without cause."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>Then Satan answered the LORD, "Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And the LORD said to Satan, "Behold, he is in your power; only spare his life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD, and afflicted Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took a potsherd with which to scrape himself, and sat among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then his wife said to him, "Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God, and die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said to her, "You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" In all this Job did not sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eli'phaz the Te'manite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Na'amathite. They made an appointment together to come to condole with him and comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they saw him from afar, they did not recognize him; and they raised their voices and wept; and they rent their robes and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>"Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night which said, ` man-child is conceived.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>That night--let thick darkness seize it! let it not rejoice among the days of the year, let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Yea, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry be heard in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let those curse it who curse the day, who are skilled to rouse up Levi'athan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>"Why did I not die at birth, come forth from the womb and expire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For then I should have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then I should have been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or why was I not as a hidden untimely birth, as infants that never see the light?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>"Why is light given to him that is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>who rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they find the grave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, whom God has hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing comes as my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest; but trouble comes."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then Eli'phaz the Te'manite answered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>"If one ventures a word with you, will you be offended? Yet who can keep from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>"Think now, who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off+?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the whelps of the lioness are scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>"Now a word was brought to me stealthily, my ear received the whisper of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>`an mortal man be righteous before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>Between morning and evening they are destroyed; they perish for ever without any regarding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>If their tent-cord is plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>"Call now; is there any one who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His sons are far from safety, they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>His harvest the hungry eat, and he takes it even out of thorns; and the thirsty pant after his wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>"As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>he gives rain upon the earth and sends waters upon the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He takes the wise in their own craftiness; and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the daytime, and grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saves the fatherless from their mouth, the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>"Behold, happy is the man whom God reproves; therefore despise not the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he wounds, but he binds up; he smites, but his hands heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven there shall no evil touch you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>You shall be hid from the scourge of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>You shall know that your tent is safe, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>You shall know also that your descendants shall be many, and your offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, as a shock of grain comes up to the threshing floor in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Lo, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then Job answered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>"O that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Does the wild ass bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the slime of the purslane?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>"O that I might have my request, and that God would grant my desire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>This would be my consolation; I would even exult in pain unsparing; for I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>In truth I have no help in me, and any resource is driven from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>"He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brethren are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as freshets that pass away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>In time of heat they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste, and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They are disappointed because they were confident; they come thither and are confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>Such you have now become to me; you see my calamity, and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Have I said, `Make me a gift'? Or, `From your wealth offer a bribe for me'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, `y's hand'? Or, `ppressors'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>"Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forceful are honest words! But what does reproof from you reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>"But now, be pleased to look at me; for I will not lie to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Turn, I pray, let no wrong be done. Turn now, my vindication is at stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there any wrong on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern calamity?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.7'>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>"Has not man a hard service upon earth, and are not his days like the days of a hireling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.2'>Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hireling who looks for his wages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.3'>so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.4'>When I lie down I say, `en I lie down I say, "When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.5'>My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.6'>My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and come to their end without hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.7'>"Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.8'>The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while thy eyes are upon me, I shall be gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.7.9'>As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>`ho is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>`ear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you declare to me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eli'phaz the Te'manite: "My wrath is kindled against you and against your two friends; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly; for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eli'phaz the Te'manite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Na'amathite went and did what the LORD had told them; and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends; and the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house; and they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him; and each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning; and he had fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first Jemi'mah; and the name of the second Kezi'ah; and the name of the third Ker'en-hap'puch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land there were no women so fair as Job's daughters; and their father gave them inheritance among their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>And Job died, an old man, and full of days.</verse>
