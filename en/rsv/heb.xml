      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <title>All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith.  Grace be with you all.</title>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>In many and various ways God spoke of old to our fathers by the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>but in these last days he has spoken to us by a Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of his nature, upholding the universe by his word of power. When he had made purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become as much superior to angels as the name he has obtained is more excellent than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to what angel did God ever say,  "Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee"? Or again,  "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when he brings the first-born into the world, he says,  "Let all God's angels worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>Of the angels he says,  "Who makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But of the Son he says,  "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever, the righteous scepter is the scepter of thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou hast loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, thy God, has anointed thee with the oil of gladness beyond thy comrades."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And,  "Thou, Lord, didst found the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of thy hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>they will perish, but thou remainest; they will all grow old like a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>like a mantle thou wilt roll them up, and they will be changed. But thou art the same, and thy years will never end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to what angel has he ever said,  "Sit at my right hand, till I make thy enemies a stool for thy feet"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to serve, for the sake of those who are to obtain salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore we must pay the closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the message declared by angels was valid and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his own will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>It has been testified somewhere, "What is man that thou art mindful of him, or the son of man, that thou carest for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou didst make him for a little while lower than the angels, thou hast crowned him with glory and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>putting everything in subjection under his feet." Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. As it is, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see Jesus, who for a little while was made lower than the angels, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have all one origin. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying, "I will proclaim thy name to my brethren, in the midst of the congregation I will praise thee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again, "Here am I, and the children God has given me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same nature, that through death he might destroy him who has the power of death, that is, the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For surely it is not with angels that he is concerned but with the descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore he had to be made like his brethren in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make expiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For because he himself has suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brethren, who share in a heavenly call, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>He was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in God's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>(For every house is built by some one, but the builder of all things is God.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ was faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house if we hold fast our confidence and pride in our hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, when you hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, `They always go astray in their hearts; they have not known my ways.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>As I swore in my wrath, `They shall never enter my rest.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take care, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today," that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we share in Christ, if only we hold our first confidence firm to the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>while it is said, "Today, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>Who were they that heard and yet were rebellious? Was it not all those who left Egypt under the leadership of Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was he provoked forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did he swear that they should never enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest remains, let us fear lest any of you be judged to have failed to reach it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For good news came to us just as to them; but the message which they heard did not benefit them, because it did not meet with faith in the hearers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, `They shall never enter my rest,'" although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way, "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>And again in this place he said, "They shall never enter my rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again he sets a certain day, "Today," saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, "Today, when you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not speak later of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>So then, there remains a sabbath rest for the people of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>for whoever enters God's rest also ceases from his labors as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, that no one fall by the same sort of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And before him no creature is hidden, but all are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>Because of this he is bound to offer sacrifice for his own sins as well as for those of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And one does not take the honor upon himself, but he is called by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, "Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>as he says also in another place, "Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchiz'edek."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard for his godly fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Although he was a Son, he learned obedience through what he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and being made perfect he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchiz'edek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>About this we have much to say which is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need some one to teach you again the first principles of God's word. You need milk, not solid food;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>for every one who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their faculties trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>with instruction about ablutions, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have become partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>if they then commit apostasy, since they crucify the Son of God on their own account and hold him up to contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For land which has drunk the rain that often falls upon it, and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed; its end is to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>Though we speak thus, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things that belong to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not so unjust as to overlook your work and the love which you showed for his sake in serving the saints, as you still do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness in realizing the full assurance of hope until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, "Surely I will bless you and multiply you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And thus Abraham, having patiently endured, obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>Men indeed swear by a greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he interposed with an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>so that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible that God should prove false, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner shrine behind the curtain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest for ever after the order of Melchiz'edek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchiz'edek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>He is without father or mother or genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>See how great he is! Abraham the patriarch gave him a tithe of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brethren, though these also are descended from Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But this man who has not their genealogy received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>Here tithes are received by mortal men; there, by one of whom it is testified that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchiz'edek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levit'ical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchiz'edek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchiz'edek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has become a priest, not according to a legal requirement concerning bodily descent but by the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is witnessed of him, "Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchiz'edek."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>On the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the law made nothing perfect); on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And it was not without an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>Those who formerly became priests took their office without an oath, but this one was addressed with an oath, "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, `Thou art a priest for ever.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>This makes Jesus the surety of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Consequently he is able for all time to save those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For it was fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, blameless, unstained, separated from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people; he did this once for all when he offered up himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>Indeed, the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect for ever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a minister in the sanctuary and the true tent which is set up not by man but by the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; hence it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly sanctuary; for when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, "See that you make everything according to the pattern which was shown you on the mountain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry which is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For he finds fault with them when he says: "The days will come, says the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt; for they did not continue in my covenant, and so I paid no heed to them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not teach every one his fellow or every one his brother, saying, `Know the Lord,' for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In speaking of a new covenant he treats the first as obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tent was prepared, the outer one, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence; it is called the Holy Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>Behind the second curtain stood a tent called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, which contained a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>These preparations having thus been made, the priests go continually into the outer tent, performing their ritual duties;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood which he offers for himself and for the errors of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the sanctuary is not yet opened as long as the outer tent is still standing</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>(which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered which cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>but deal only with food and drink and various ablutions, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>he entered once for all into the Holy Place, taking not the blood of goats and calves but his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the sprinkling of defiled persons with the blood of goats and bulls and with the ashes of a heifer sanctifies for the purification of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred which redeems them from the transgressions under the first covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Hence even the first covenant was not ratified without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ has entered, not into a sanctuary made with hands, a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the Holy Place yearly with blood not his own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the age to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And just as it is appointed for men to die once, and after that comes judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices which are continually offered year after year, make perfect those who draw near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered? If the worshipers had once been cleansed, they would no longer have any consciousness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sin year after year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices and offerings thou hast not desired, but a body hast thou prepared for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>in burnt offerings and sin offerings thou hast taken no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, `Lo, I have come to do thy will, O God,' as it is written of me in the roll of the book."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>When he said above, "Thou hast neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings" (these are offered according to the law),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then he added, "Lo, I have come to do thy will." He abolishes the first in order to establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>then to wait until his enemies should be made a stool for his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>then he adds, "I will remember their sins and their misdeeds no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by the new and living way which he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and since we have a great priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>and let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a fearful prospect of judgment, and a fury of fire which will consume the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>sometimes being publicly exposed to abuse and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you had compassion on the prisoners, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you have need of endurance, so that you may do the will of God and receive what is promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>"For yet a little while, and the coming one shall come and shall not tarry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and keep their souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it the men of old received divine approval.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand that the world was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made out of things which do not appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he received approval as righteous, God bearing witness by accepting his gifts; he died, but through his faith he is still speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was attested as having pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>And without faith it is impossible to please him. For whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, took heed and constructed an ark for the saving of his household; by this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which comes by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place which he was to receive as an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he looked forward to the city which has foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died in faith, not having received what was promised, but having seen it and greeted it from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was ready to offer up his only son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.18'>of whom it was said, "Through Isaac shall your descendants be named."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'>He considered that God was able to raise men even from the dead; hence, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful; and they were not afraid of the king's edict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>choosing rather to share ill-treatment with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>He considered abuse suffered for the Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he looked to the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king; for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the first-born might not touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as if on dry land; but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>quenched raging fire, escaped the edge of the sword, won strength out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Women received their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, that they might rise again to a better life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'>Others suffered mocking and scourging, and even chains and imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword; they went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, ill-treated--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.38'>of whom the world was not worthy-- wandering over deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'>And all these, though well attested by their faith, did not receive what was promised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.40'>since God had foreseen something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.12'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.1'>Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with perseverance the race that is set before us,</verse>
