      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <title>if you transgress the covenant of the LORD your God, which he commanded you, and go and serve other gods and bow down to them. Then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from off the good land which he has given to you."</title>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>After the death of Joshua the people of Israel inquired of the LORD,of "Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>The LORD said, "Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, "Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you." So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>Then Judah went up and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Per'izzites into their hand; and they defeated ten thousand of them at Bezek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>They came upon Ado'ni-be'zek at Bezek, and fought against him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Per'izzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>Ado'ni-be'zek fled; but they pursued him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Ado'ni-be'zek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and their great toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table; as I have done, so God has requited me." And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kir'iath-ar'ba); and they defeated She'shai and Ahi'man and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kir'iath-se'pher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, "He who attacks Kir'iath-se'pher and takes it, I will give him Achsah my daughter as wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Oth'ni-el the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it; and he gave him Achsah his daughter as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field; and she alighted from her ass, and Caleb said to her, "What do you wish?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>She said to him, "Give me a present; since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water." And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the descendants of the Ken'ite, Moses' father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad; and they went and settled with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. So the name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Judah also took Gaza with its territory, and Ash'kelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And the LORD was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain, because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said; and he drove out from it the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jeb'usites who dwelt in Jerusalem; so the Jeb'usites have dwelt with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel; and the LORD was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, "Pray, show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And he showed them the way into the city; and they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city, and called its name Luz; that is its name to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>Manas'seh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-she'an and its villages, or Ta'a-nach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megid'do and its villages; but the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>And E'phraim did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Zeb'ulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Na'halol; but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to forced labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Naph'tali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-she'mesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-she'mesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>The Amorites pressed the Danites back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>the Amorites persisted in dwelling in Har-heres, in Ai'jalon, and in Sha-al'bim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily upon them, and they became subject to forced labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrab'bim, from Sela and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>Now the angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, "I brought you up from Egypt, and brought you into the land which I swore to give to your fathers. I said, `I will never break my covenant with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars.' But you have not obeyed my command. What is this you have done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>So now I say, I will not drive them out before you; but they shall become adversaries to you, and their gods shall be a snare to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>When the angel of the LORD spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place Bochim; and they sacrificed there to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work which the LORD had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of one hundred and ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him within the bounds of his inheritance in Tim'nath-he'res, in the hill country of E'phraim, north of the mountain of Ga'ash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers; and there arose another generation after them, who did not know the LORD or the work which he had done for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD and served the Ba'als;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>and they forsook the LORD, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt; they went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed down to them; and they provoked the LORD to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>They forsook the LORD, and served the Ba'als and the Ash'taroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them; and he sold them into the power of their enemies round about, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Whenever they marched out, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil, as the LORD had warned, and as the LORD had sworn to them; and they were in sore straits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>Then the LORD raised up judges, who saved them out of the power of those who plundered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>And yet they did not listen to their judges; for they played the harlot after other gods and bowed down to them; they soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the LORD, and they did not do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>Whenever the LORD raised up judges for them, the LORD was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>But whenever the judge died, they turned back and behaved worse than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them; they did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel; and he said, "Because this people have transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and have not obeyed my voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I will not henceforth drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>that by them I may test Israel, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the LORD as their fathers did, or not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>So the LORD left those nations, not driving them out at once, and he did not give them into the power of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had no experience of any war in Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>it was only that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, that he might teach war to such at least as had not known it before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sido'nians, and the Hivites who dwelt on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Ba'al-her'mon as far as the entrance of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the LORD, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>So the people of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Per'izzites, the Hivites, and the Jeb'usites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>and they took their daughters to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons; and they served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, forgetting the LORD their God, and serving the Ba'als and the Ashe'roth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cu'shan-rishatha'im king of Mesopota'mia; and the people of Israel served Cu'shan-rishatha'im eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>But when the people of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who delivered them, Oth'ni-el the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel; he went out to war, and the LORD gave Cu'shan-rishatha'im king of Mesopota'mia into his hand; and his hand prevailed over Cu'shan-rishatha'im.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>So the land had rest forty years. Then Oth'ni-el the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amal'ekites, and went and defeated Israel; and they took possession of the city of palms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the people of Israel cried to the LORD, the LORD raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length; and he girded it on his right thigh under his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people that carried the tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned back at the sculptured stones near Gilgal, and said, "I have a secret message for you, O king." And he commanded, "Silence." And all his attendants went out from his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came to him, as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you." And he arose from his seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>and the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the dirt came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went out into the vestibule, and closed the doors of the roof chamber upon him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>When he had gone, the servants came; and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, "He is only relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they waited till they were utterly at a loss; but when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them; and there lay their lord dead on the floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the sculptured stones, and escaped to Se-i'rah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of E'phraim; and the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, having him at their head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said to them, "Follow after me; for the LORD has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand." So they went down after him, and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and allowed not a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they killed at that time about ten thousand of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed six hundred of the Philistines with an oxgoad; and he too delivered Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor; the commander of his army was Sis'era, who dwelt in Haro'sheth-ha-goiim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>Then the people of Israel cried to the LORD for help; for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>Now Deb'orah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapp'idoth, was judging Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>She used to sit under the palm of Deb'orah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of E'phraim; and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abin'o-am from Kedesh in Naph'tali, and said to him, "The LORD, the God of Israel, commands you, `Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking ten thousand from the tribe of Naph'tali and the tribe of Zeb'ulun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>And I will draw out Sis'era, the general of Jabin's army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops; and I will give him into your hand.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>Barak said to her, "If you will go with me, I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, "I will surely go with you; nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the LORD will sell Sis'era into the hand of a woman." Then Deb'orah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak summoned Zeb'ulun and Naph'tali to Kedesh; and ten thousand men went up at his heels; and Deb'orah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber the Ken'ite had separated from the Ken'ites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Za-anan'nim, which is near Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>When Sis'era was told that Barak the son of Abin'o-am had gone up to Mount Tabor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>Sis'era called out all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Haro'sheth-ha-goiim to the river Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deb'orah said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sis'era into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And the LORD routed Sis'era and all his chariots and all his army before Barak at the edge of the sword; and Sis'era alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Haro'sheth-ha-goiim, and all the army of Sis'era fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>But Sis'era fled away on foot to the tent of Ja'el, the wife of Heber the Ken'ite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Ken'ite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Ja'el came out to meet Sis'era, and said to him, "Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; have no fear." So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said to her, "Pray, give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>And he said to her, "Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, `Is any one here?' say, No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>But Ja'el the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, till it went down into the ground, as he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And behold, as Barak pursued Sis'era, Ja'el went out to meet him, and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." So he went in to her tent; and there lay Sis'era dead, with the tent peg in his temple.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.1'>The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD gave them into the hand of Mid'ian seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.2'>And the hand of Mid'ian prevailed over Israel; and because of Mid'ian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens which are in the mountains, and the caves and the strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.3'>For whenever the Israelites put in seed the Mid'ianites and the Amal'ekites and the people of the East would come up and attack them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.4'>they would encamp against them and destroy the produce of the land, as far as the neighborhood of Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel, and no sheep or ox or ass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.5'>For they would come up with their cattle and their tents, coming like locusts for number; both they and their camels could not be counted; so that they wasted the land as they came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.6'>And Israel was brought very low because of Mid'ian; and the people of Israel cried for help to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.7'>When the people of Israel cried to the LORD on account of the Mid'ianites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.8'>the LORD sent a prophet to the people of Israel; and he said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: I led you up from Egypt, and brought you out of the house of bondage;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.10'>and I said to you, `I am the LORD your God; you shall not pay reverence to the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell.' But you have not given heed to my voice."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.11'>Now the angel of the LORD came and sat under the oak at Ophrah, which belonged to Jo'ash the Abiez'rite, as his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the wine press, to hide it from the Mid'ianites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.12'>And the angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, "The LORD is with you, you mighty man of valor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.13'>And Gideon said to him, "Pray, sir, if the LORD is with us, why then has all this befallen us? And where are all his wonderful deeds which our fathers recounted to us, saying, `Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?' But now the LORD has cast us off, and given us into the hand of Mid'ian."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.14'>And the LORD turned to him and said, "Go in this might of yours and deliver Israel from the hand of Mid'ian; do not I send you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.15'>And he said to him, "Pray, Lord, how can I deliver Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manas'seh, and I am the least in my family."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.16'>And the LORD said to him, "But I will be with you, and you shall smite the Mid'ianites as one man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.17'>And he said to him, "If now I have found favor with thee, then show me a sign that it is thou who speakest with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.18'>Do not depart from here, I pray thee, until I come to thee, and bring out my present, and set it before thee." And he said, "I will stay till you return."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.19'>So Gideon went into his house and prepared a kid, and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour; the meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the oak and presented them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.20'>And the angel of God said to him, "Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them." And he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.21'>Then the angel of the LORD reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes; and there sprang up fire from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes; and the angel of the LORD vanished from his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.22'>Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the LORD; and Gideon said, "Alas, O Lord GOD! For now I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.23'>But the LORD said to him, "Peace be to you; do not fear, you shall not die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.24'>Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD, and called it, The LORD is peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiez'rites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.25'>That night the LORD said to him, "Take your father's bull, the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Ba'al which your father has, and cut down the Ashe'rah that is beside it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.26'>and build an altar to the LORD your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order; then take the second bull, and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Ashe'rah which you shall cut down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.27'>So Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD had told him; but because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.28'>When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Ba'al was broken down, and the Ashe'rah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered upon the altar which had been built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.29'>And they said to one another, "Who has done this thing?" And after they had made search and inquired, they said, "Gideon the son of Jo'ash has done this thing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.30'>Then the men of the town said to Jo'ash, "Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has pulled down the altar of Ba'al and cut down the Ashe'rah beside it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.31'>But Jo'ash said to all who were arrayed against him, "Will you contend for Ba'al? Or will you defend his cause? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been pulled down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.32'>Therefore on that day he was called Jerubba'al, that is to say, "Let Ba'al contend against him," because he pulled down his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.33'>Then all the Mid'ianites and the Amal'ekites and the people of the East came together, and crossing the Jordan they encamped in the Valley of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.34'>But the Spirit of the LORD took possession of Gideon; and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiez'rites were called out to follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.35'>And he sent messengers throughout all Manas'seh; and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zeb'ulun, and Naph'tali; and they went up to meet them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.36'>Then Gideon said to God, "If thou wilt deliver Israel by my hand, as thou hast said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.37'>behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor; if there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that thou wilt deliver Israel by my hand, as thou hast said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>Then Gideon said to God, "Let not thy anger burn against me, let me speak but this once; pray, let me make trial only this once with the fleece; pray, let it be dry only on the fleece, and on all the ground let there be dew."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.40'>And God did so that night; for it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.7'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>Then Jerubba'al (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Mid'ian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>The LORD said to Gideon, "The people with you are too many for me to give the Mid'ianites into their hand, lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, `My own hand has delivered me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, `Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home.'" And Gideon tested them; twenty-two thousand returned, and ten thousand remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>And the LORD said to Gideon, "The people are still too many; take them down to the water and I will test them for you there; and he of whom I say to you, `This man shall go with you,' shall go with you; and any of whom I say to you, `This man shall not go with you,' shall not go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>So he brought the people down to the water; and the LORD said to Gideon, "Every one that laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself; likewise every one that kneels down to drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>And the number of those that lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was three hundred men; but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>And the LORD said to Gideon, "With the three hundred men that lapped I will deliver you, and give the Mid'ianites into your hand; and let all the others go every man to his home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>So he took the jars of the people from their hands, and their trumpets; and he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men; and the camp of Mid'ian was below him in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>That same night the LORD said to him, "Arise, go down against the camp; for I have given it into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.10'>But if you fear to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>and you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp." Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men that were in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>And the Mid'ianites and the Amal'ekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is upon the seashore for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade; and he said, "Behold, I dreamed a dream; and lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Mid'ian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>And his comrade answered, "This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Jo'ash, a man of Israel; into his hand God has given Mid'ian and all the host."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>When Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped; and he returned to the camp of Israel, and said, "Arise; for the LORD has given the host of Mid'ian into your hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>And he said to them, "Look at me, and do likewise; when I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.18'>When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and shout, `For the LORD and for Gideon.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.19'>So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch; and they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>And the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars, holding in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow; and they cried, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.21'>They stood every man in his place round about the camp, and all the army ran; they cried out and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>When they blew the three hundred trumpets, the LORD set every man's sword against his fellow and against all the army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shit'tah toward Zer'erah, as far as the border of A'bel-meho'lah, by Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>And the men of Israel were called out from Naph'tali and from Asher and from all Manas'seh, and they pursued after Mid'ian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>And Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of E'phraim, saying, "Come down against the Mid'ianites and seize the waters against them, as far as Beth-bar'ah, and also the Jordan." So all the men of E'phraim were called out, and they seized the waters as far as Beth-bar'ah, and also the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>And they took the two princes of Mid'ian, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the wine press of Zeeb, as they pursued Mid'ian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.8'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.1'>And the men of E'phraim said to him, "What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight with Mid'ian?" And they upbraided him violently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.2'>And he said to them, "What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of E'phraim better than the vintage of Abi-e'zer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.3'>God has given into your hands the princes of Mid'ian, Oreb and Zeeb; what have I been able to do in comparison with you?" Then their anger against him was abated, when he had said this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.4'>And Gideon came to the Jordan and passed over, he and the three hundred men who were with him, faint yet pursuing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.5'>So he said to the men of Succoth, "Pray, give loaves of bread to the people who follow me; for they are faint, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmun'na, the kings of Mid'ian."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.6'>And the officials of Succoth said, "Are Zebah and Zalmun'na already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.7'>And Gideon said, "Well then, when the LORD has given Zebah and Zalmun'na into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.8'>And from there he went up to Penu'el, and spoke to them in the same way; and the men of Penu'el answered him as the men of Succoth had answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.9'>And he said to the men of Penu'el, "When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.10'>Now Zebah and Zalmun'na were in Karkor with their army, about fifteen thousand men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East; for there had fallen a hundred and twenty thousand men who drew the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.11'>And Gideon went up by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jog'behah, and attacked the army; for the army was off its guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.12'>And Zebah and Zalmun'na fled; and he pursued them and took the two kings of Mid'ian, Zebah and Zalmun'na, and he threw all the army into a panic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.13'>Then Gideon the son of Jo'ash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.14'>And he caught a young man of Succoth, and questioned him; and he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.15'>And he came to the men of Succoth, and said, "Behold Zebah and Zalmun'na, about whom you taunted me, saying, `Are Zebah and Zalmun'na already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are faint?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.16'>And he took the elders of the city and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.17'>And he broke down the tower of Penu'el, and slew the men of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.18'>Then he said to Zebah and Zalmun'na, "Where are the men whom you slew at Tabor?" They answered, "As you are, so were they, every one of them; they resembled the sons of a king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.19'>And he said, "They were my brothers, the sons of my mother; as the LORD lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not slay you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.20'>And he said to Jether his first-born, "Rise, and slay them." But the youth did not draw his sword; for he was afraid, because he was still a youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.21'>Then Zebah and Zalmun'na said, "Rise yourself, and fall upon us; for as the man is, so is his strength." And Gideon arose and slew Zebah and Zalmun'na; and he took the crescents that were on the necks of their camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.22'>Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, "Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also; for you have delivered us out of the hand of Mid'ian."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.8.25'>And they answered, "We will willingly give them." And they spread a garment, and every man cast in it the earrings of his spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.26'>And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was one thousand seven hundred shekels of gold; besides the crescents and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Mid'ian, and besides the collars that were about the necks of their camels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.27'>And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah; and all Israel played the harlot after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.28'>So Mid'ian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they lifted up their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.14.4'>His father and mother did not know that it was from the LORD; for he was seeking an occasion against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.15.7'>And Samson said to them, "If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged upon you, and after that I will quit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.8'>And he smote them hip and thigh with great slaughter; and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.15.12'>And they said to him, "We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines." And Samson said to them, "Swear to me that you will not fall upon me yourselves."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.13'>They said to him, "No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands; we will not kill you." So they bound him with two new ropes, and brought him up from the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.14'>When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and the ropes which were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.15.15'>And he found a fresh jawbone of an ass, and put out his hand and seized it, and with it he slew a thousand men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.4'>After this he loved a woman in the valley of Sorek, whose name was Deli'lah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.5'>And the lords of the Philistines came to her and said to her, "Entice him, and see wherein his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to subdue him; and we will each give you eleven hundred pieces of silver."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.8'>Then the lords of the Philistines brought her seven fresh bowstrings which had not been dried, and she bound him with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.9'>Now she had men lying in wait in an inner chamber. And she said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he snapped the bowstrings, as a string of tow snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.10'>And Deli'lah said to Samson, "Behold, you have mocked me, and told me lies; please tell me how you might be bound."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.12'>So Deli'lah took new ropes and bound him with them, and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" And the men lying in wait were in an inner chamber. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.13'>And Deli'lah said to Samson, "Until now you have mocked me, and told me lies; tell me how you might be bound."

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.14'>So while he slept, Deli'lah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web. And she made them tight with the pin, and said to him, "The Philistines are upon you, Samson!" But he awoke from his sleep, and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.15'>And she said to him, "How can you say, `I love you,' when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me wherein your great strength lies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.16'>And when she pressed him hard with her words day after day, and urged him, his soul was vexed to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.17'>And he told her all his mind, and said to her, "A razor has never come upon my head; for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother's womb. If I be shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak, and be like any other man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.18'>When Deli'lah saw that he had told her all his mind, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, "Come up this once, for he has told me all his mind." Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her, and brought the money in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.19'>She made him sleep upon her knees; and she called a man, and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.23'>Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to rejoice; for they said, "Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.25'>And when their hearts were merry, they said, "Call Samson, that he may make sport for us." So they called Samson out of the prison, and he made sport before them. They made him stand between the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.26'>and Samson said to the lad who held him by the hand, "Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.27'>Now the house was full of men and women; all the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about three thousand men and women, who looked on while Samson made sport.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.16.29'>And Samson grasped the two middle pillars upon which the house rested, and he leaned his weight upon them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.30'>And Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines." Then he bowed with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people that were in it. So the dead whom he slew at his death were more than those whom he had slain during his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.16.31'>Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Esh'ta-ol in the tomb of Mano'ah his father. He had judged Israel twenty years.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.18.7'>Then the five men departed, and came to La'ish, and saw the people who were there, how they dwelt in security, after the manner of the Sido'nians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing that is in the earth, and possessing wealth, and how they were far from the Sido'nians and had no dealings with any one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.8'>And when they came to their brethren at Zorah and Esh'ta-ol, their brethren said to them, "What do you report?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.9'>They said, "Arise, and let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very fertile. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, and enter in and possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.10'>When you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is broad; yea, God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.11'>And six hundred men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set forth from Zorah and Esh'ta-ol,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.12'>and went up and encamped at Kir'iath-je'arim in Judah. On this account that place is called Ma'haneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kir'iath-je'arim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.13'>And they passed on from there to the hill country of E'phraim, and came to the house of Micah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.14'>Then the five men who had gone to spy out the country of La'ish said to their brethren, "Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, teraphim, a graven image, and a molten image? Now therefore consider what you will do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.15'>And they turned aside thither, and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him of his welfare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.16'>Now the six hundred men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.17'>and the five men who had gone to spy out the land went up, and entered and took the graven image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.18'>And when these went into Micah's house and took the graven image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the molten image, the priest said to them, "What are you doing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.19'>And they said to him, "Keep quiet, put your hand upon your mouth, and come with us, and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and family in Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.20'>And the priest's heart was glad; he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.21'>So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the cattle and the goods in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.22'>When they were a good way from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah's house were called out, and they overtook the Danites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.23'>And they shouted to the Danites, who turned round and said to Micah, "What ails you that you come with such a company?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.24'>And he said, "You take my gods which I made, and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, `What ails you?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.25'>And the Danites said to him, "Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.26'>Then the Danites went their way; and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.27'>And taking what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, the Danites came to La'ish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and smote them with the edge of the sword, and burned the city with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.28'>And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any one. It was in the valley which belongs to Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city, and dwelt in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.29'>And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was La'ish at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.30'>And the Danites set up the graven image for themselves; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.18.31'>So they set up Micah's graven image which he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.19.1'>In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of the hill country of E'phraim, who took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.2'>And his concubine became angry with him, and she went away from him to her father's house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.3'>Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of asses. And he came to her father's house; and when the girl's father saw him, he came with joy to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.4'>And his father-in-law, the girl's father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days; so they ate and drank, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.5'>And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go; but the girl's father said to his son-in-law, "Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.6'>So the two men sat and ate and drank together; and the girl's father said to the man, "Be pleased to spend the night, and let your heart be merry."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.7'>And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law urged him, till he lodged there again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.8'>And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart; and the girl's father said, "Strengthen your heart, and tarry until the day declines." So they ate, both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.9'>And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl's father, said to him, "Behold, now the day has waned toward evening; pray tarry all night.

        <verse osisID='Judg.19.10'>But the man would not spend the night; he rose up and departed, and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem). He had with him a couple of saddled asses, and his concubine was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.11'>When they were near Jebus, the day was far spent, and the servant said to his master, "Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jeb'usites, and spend the night in it."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.19.23'>And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, "No, my brethren, do not act so wickedly; seeing that this man has come into my house, do not do this vile thing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.19.26'>And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man's house where her master was, till it was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.27'>And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.19.28'>He said to her, "Get up, let us be going." But there was no answer. Then he put her upon the ass; and the man rose up and went away to his home.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.20.1'>Then all the people of Israel came out, from Dan to Beer-sheba, including the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled as one man to the LORD at Mizpah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.20.8'>And all the people arose as one man, saying, "We will not any of us go to his tent, and none of us will return to his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.20.14'>And the Benjaminites came together out of the cities to Gib'e-ah, to go out to battle against the people of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.20.29'>So Israel set men in ambush round about Gib'e-ah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.20.31'>And the Benjaminites went out against the people, and were drawn away from the city; and as at other times they began to smite and kill some of the people, in the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gib'e-ah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.32'>And the Benjaminites said, "They are routed before us, as at the first." But the men of Israel said, "Let us flee, and draw them away from the city to the highways."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.20.40'>But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them; and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven.</verse>
