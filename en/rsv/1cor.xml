  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sos'thenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>To the church of God which is at Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks to God always for you because of the grace of God which was given you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in every way you were enriched in him with all speech and all knowledge--</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>even as the testimony to Christ was confirmed among you--</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>I appeal to you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there be no dissensions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been reported to me by Chlo'e's people that there is quarreling among you, my brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>What I mean is that each one of you says, "I belong to Paul," or "I belong to Apol'los," or "I belong to Cephas," or "I belong to Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I am thankful that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Ga'ius;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest any one should say that you were baptized in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>(I did baptize also the household of Steph'anas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized any one else.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the cleverness of the clever I will thwart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise man? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For consider your call, brethren; not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>He is the source of your life in Christ Jesus, whom God made our wisdom, our righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>therefore, as it is written, "Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>When I came to you, brethren, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God in lofty words or wisdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness and in much fear and trembling;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glorification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>None of the rulers of this age understood this; for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But, as it is written, "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, what God has prepared for those who love him,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what person knows a man's thoughts except the spirit of the man which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, that we might understand the gifts bestowed on us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who possess the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>The unspiritual man does not receive the gifts of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>The spiritual man judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>"For who has known the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>But I, brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as men of the flesh, as babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I fed you with milk, not solid food; for you were not ready for it; and even yet you are not ready,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh, and behaving like ordinary men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, "I belong to Paul," and another, "I belong to Apol'los," are you not merely men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>What then is Apol'los? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apol'los watered, but God gave the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>He who plants and he who waters are equal, and each shall receive his wages according to his labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's field, God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and another man is building upon it. Let each man take care how he builds upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no other foundation can any one lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if any one builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw--</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each man's work will become manifest; for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If the work which any man has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any man's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any one destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and that temple you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their craftiness,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are futile."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So let no one boast of men. For all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul or Apol'los or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future, all are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ's; and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Moreover it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then every man will receive his commendation from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>I have applied all this to myself and Apol'los for your benefit, brethren, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who sees anything different in you? What have you that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already you are filled! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death; because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are ill-clad and buffeted and homeless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>when slandered, we try to conciliate; we have become, and are now, as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write this to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I urge you, then, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>Therefore I sent to you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually reported that there is immorality among you, and of a kind that is not found even among pagans; for a man is living with his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For though absent in body I am present in spirit, and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of the Lord Jesus on the man who has done such a thing. When you are assembled, and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our paschal lamb, has been sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Let us, therefore, celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with immoral men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>not at all meaning the immoral of this world, or the greedy and robbers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But rather I wrote to you not to associate with any one who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or robber--not even to eat with such a one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>God judges those outside. "Drive out the wicked person from among you."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>When one of you has a grievance against a brother, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, matters pertaining to this life!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who are least esteemed by the church?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no man among you wise enough to decide between members of the brotherhood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>To have lawsuits at all with one another is defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you yourselves wrong and defraud, and that even your own brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived; neither the immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor sexual perverts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor robbers will inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>"All things are lawful for me," but not all things are helpful. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be enslaved by anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>"Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food"--and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I therefore take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>Do you not know that he who joins himself to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, "The two shall become one flesh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Shun immorality. Every other sin which a man commits is outside the body; but the immoral man sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, which you have from God? You are not your own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the matters about which you wrote. It is well for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>But because of the temptation to immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>For the wife does not rule over her own body, but the husband does; likewise the husband does not rule over his own body, but the wife does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not refuse one another except perhaps by agreement for a season, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, lest Satan tempt you through lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>I say this by way of concession, not of command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own special gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is well for them to remain single as I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to be aflame with passion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>To the married I give charge, not I but the Lord, that the wife should not separate from her husband</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>(but if she does, let her remain single or else be reconciled to her husband)--and that the husband should not divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>To the rest I say, not the Lord, that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband is consecrated through his wife, and the unbelieving wife is consecrated through her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but as it is they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbelieving partner desires to separate, let it be so; in such a case the brother or sister is not bound. For God has called us to peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>Wife, how do you know whether you will save your husband? Husband, how do you know whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>Only, let every one lead the life which the Lord has assigned to him, and in which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was any one at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was any one at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Every one should remain in the state in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you a slave when called? Never mind. But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a slave of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>So, brethren, in whatever state each was called, there let him remain with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Now concerning the unmarried, I have no command of the Lord, but I give my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>I think that in view of the present distress it is well for a person to remain as he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But if you marry, you do not sin, and if a girl marries she does not sin. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>I mean, brethren, the appointed time has grown very short; from now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the form of this world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to please the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>but the married man is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>and his interests are divided. And the unmarried woman or girl is anxious about the affairs of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit; but the married woman is anxious about worldly affairs, how to please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>If any one thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry--it is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So that he who marries his betrothed does well; and he who refrains from marriage will do better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If the husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that "all of us possess knowledge." "Knowledge" puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But if one loves God, one is known by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that "an idol has no real existence," and that "there is no God but one."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through being hitherto accustomed to idols, eat food as really offered to an idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>Only take care lest this liberty of yours somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if any one sees you, a man of knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, might he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>And so by your knowledge this weak man is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>Thus, sinning against your brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>that there may be no discord in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then workers of miracles, then healers, helpers, administrators, speakers in various kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But earnestly desire the higher gifts.  And I will show you a still more excellent way.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>If I give away all I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Love is patient and kind; love is not jealous or boastful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Love never ends; as for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophecy is imperfect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>but when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child; when I became a man, I gave up childish ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall understand fully, even as I have been fully understood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>So faith, hope, love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Make love your aim, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>On the other hand, he who prophesies speaks to men for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in a tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. He who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless some one interprets, so that the church may be edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how shall I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will any one know what is played?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So with yourselves; if you in a tongue utter speech that is not intelligible, how will any one know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I shall be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So with yourselves; since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore, he who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What am I to do? I will pray with the spirit and I will pray with the mind also; I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how can any one in the position of an outsider say the "Amen" to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For you may give thanks well enough, but the other man is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind, in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, do not be children in your thinking; be babes in evil, but in thinking be mature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written, "By men of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Thus, tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is not for unbelievers but for believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If, therefore, the whole church assembles and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>the secrets of his heart are disclosed; and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What then, brethren? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn; and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silence in church and speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>If a revelation is made to another sitting by, let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not a God of confusion but of peace.  As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>the women should keep silence in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be subordinate, as even the law says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>What! Did the word of God originate with you, or are you the only ones it has reached?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any one thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that what I am writing to you is a command of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>If any one does not recognize this, he is not recognized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>So, my brethren, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>but all things should be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I would remind you, brethren, in what terms I preached to you the gospel, which you received, in which you stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>by which you are saved, if you hold it fast--unless you believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>Then he appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, unfit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God which is with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified of God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, then Christ has not been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>If Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are of all men most to be pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each in his own order: Christ the first fruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy to be destroyed is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>"For God has put all things in subjection under his feet." But when it says, "All things are put in subjection under him," it is plain that he is excepted who put all things under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things under him, that God may be everything to every one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>Why am I in peril every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I protest, brethren, by my pride in you which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Come to your right mind, and sin no more. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some one will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>You foolish man! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And what you sow is not the body which is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>For not all flesh is alike, but there is one kind for men, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are celestial bodies and there are terrestrial bodies; but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable, what is raised is imperishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a physical body, it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>Thus it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>But it is not the spiritual which is first but the physical, and then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As was the man of dust, so are those who are of the dust; and as is the man of heaven, so are those who are of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>I tell you this, brethren: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Lo! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this perishable nature must put on the imperishable, and this mortal nature must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: "Death is swallowed up in victory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>"O death, where is thy victory? O death, where is thy sting?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.1'>Now concerning the contribution for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.2'>On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that contributions need not be made when I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.3'>And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.7'>For I do not want to see you now just in passing; I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.8'>But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.12'>As for our brother Apol'los, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brethren, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.14'>Let all that you do be done in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.15'>Now, brethren, you know that the household of Steph'anas were the first converts in Acha'ia, and they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.16'>I urge you to be subject to such men and to every fellow worker and laborer.</verse>
