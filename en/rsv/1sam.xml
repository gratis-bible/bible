      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <title>She replied, "Wait, my daughter, until you learn how the matter turns out, for the man will not rest, but will settle the matter today."</title>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>There was a certain man of Ramatha'im-zo'phim of the hill country of E'phraim, whose name was Elka'nah the son of Jero'ham, son of Eli'hu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, an E'phraimite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>He had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other Penin'nah. And Penin'nah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>Now this man used to go up year by year from his city to worship and to sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh, where the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin'ehas, were priests of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>On the day when Elka'nah sacrificed, he would give portions to Penin'nah his wife and to all her sons and daughters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>and, although he loved Hannah, he would give Hannah only one portion, because the LORD had closed her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her rival used to provoke her sorely, to irritate her, because the LORD had closed her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>So it went on year by year; as often as she went up to the house of the LORD, she used to provoke her. Therefore Hannah wept and would not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>And Elka'nah, her husband, said to her, "Hannah, why do you weep? And why do you not eat? And why is your heart sad? Am I not more to you than ten sons?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>After they had eaten and drunk in Shiloh, Hannah rose. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the seat beside the doorpost of the temple of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>She was deeply distressed and prayed to the LORD, and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow and said, "O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt indeed look on the affliction of thy maidservant, and remember me, and not forget thy maidservant, but wilt give to thy maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life, and no razor shall touch his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>As she continued praying before the LORD, Eli observed her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Hannah was speaking in her heart; only her lips moved, and her voice was not heard; therefore Eli took her to be a drunken woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said to her, "How long will you be drunken? Put away your wine from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>But Hannah answered, "No, my lord, I am a woman sorely troubled; I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I have been pouring out my soul before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Do not regard your maidservant as a base woman, for all along I have been speaking out of my great anxiety and vexation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered, "Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant your petition which you have made to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, "Let your maidservant find favor in your eyes." Then the woman went her way and ate, and her countenance was no longer sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>They rose early in the morning and worshiped before the LORD; then they went back to their house at Ramah. And Elka'nah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>and in due time Hannah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Samuel, for she said, "I have asked him of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elka'nah and all his house went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and to pay his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, "As soon as the child is weaned, I will bring him, that he may appear in the presence of the LORD, and abide there for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>Elka'nah her husband said to her, "Do what seems best to you, wait until you have weaned him; only, may the LORD establish his word." So the woman remained and nursed her son, until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a skin of wine; and she brought him to the house of the LORD at Shiloh; and the child was young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>Then they slew the bull, and they brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, "Oh, my lord! As you live, my lord, I am the woman who was standing here in your presence, praying to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>For this child I prayed; and the LORD has granted me my petition which I made to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he lives, he is lent to the LORD."  And they worshiped the LORD there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>Hannah also prayed and said, "My heart exults in the LORD; my strength is exalted in the LORD. My mouth derides my enemies, because I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>"There is none holy like the LORD, there is none besides thee; there is no rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Talk no more so very proudly, let not arrogance come from your mouth; for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bows of the mighty are broken, but the feeble gird on strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>Those who were full have hired themselves out for bread, but those who were hungry have ceased to hunger. The barren has borne seven, but she who has many children is forlorn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>The LORD kills and brings to life; he brings down to Sheol and raises up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>The LORD makes poor and makes rich; he brings low, he also exalts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raises up the poor from the dust; he lifts the needy from the ash heap, to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. For the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and on them he has set the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>"He will guard the feet of his faithful ones; but the wicked shall be cut off in darkness; for not by might shall a man prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; against them he will thunder in heaven. The LORD will judge the ends of the earth; he will give strength to his king, and exalt the power of his anointed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>Then Elka'nah went home to Ramah. And the boy ministered to the LORD, in the presence of Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli were worthless men; they had no regard for the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>The custom of the priests with the people was that when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant would come, while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged fork in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>and he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; all that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. So they did at Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>Moreover, before the fat was burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, "Give meat for the priest to roast; for he will not accept boiled meat from you, but raw."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And if the man said to him, "Let them burn the fat first, and then take as much as you wish," he would say, "No, you must give it now; and if not, I will take it by force."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>Thus the sin of the young men was very great in the sight of the LORD; for the men treated the offering of the LORD with contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>Samuel was ministering before the LORD, a boy girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>And his mother used to make for him a little robe and take it to him each year, when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>Then Eli would bless Elka'nah and his wife, and say, "The LORD give you children by this woman for the loan which she lent to the LORD"; so then they would return to their home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And the LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived and bore three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew in the presence of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old, and he heard all that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who served at the entrance to the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them, "Why do you do such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons; it is no good report that I hear the people of the LORD spreading abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If a man sins against a man, God will mediate for him; but if a man sins against the LORD, who can intercede for him?" But they would not listen to the voice of their father; for it was the will of the LORD to slay them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>Now the boy Samuel continued to grow both in stature and in favor with the LORD and with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, "Thus the LORD has said, `I revealed myself to the house of your father when they were in Egypt subject to the house of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And I chose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me; and I gave to the house of your father all my offerings by fire from the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Why then look with greedy eye at my sacrifices and my offerings which I commanded, and honor your sons above me by fattening yourselves upon the choicest parts of every offering of my people Israel?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Therefore the LORD the God of Israel declares: `I promised that your house and the house of your father should go in and out before me for ever'; but now the LORD declares: `Far be it from me; for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me shall be lightly esteemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days are coming, when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father's house, so that there will not be an old man in your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>Then in distress you will look with envious eye on all the prosperity which shall be bestowed upon Israel; and there shall not be an old man in your house for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>The man of you whom I shall not cut off from my altar shall be spared to weep out his eyes and grieve his heart; and all the increase of your house shall die by the sword of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this which shall befall your two sons, Hophni and Phin'ehas, shall be the sign to you: both of them shall die on the same day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise up for myself a faithful priest, who shall do according to what is in my heart and in my mind; and I will build him a sure house, and he shall go in and out before my anointed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And every one who is left in your house shall come to implore him for a piece of silver or a loaf of bread, and shall say, "Put me, I pray you, in one of the priest's places, that I may eat a morsel of bread."'"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the LORD under Eli. And the word of the LORD was rare in those days; there was no frequent vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim, so that he could not see, was lying down in his own place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down within the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>Then the LORD called, "Samuel! Samuel!" and he said, "Here I am!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>and ran to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call; lie down again." So he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And the LORD called again, "Samuel!" And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." But he said, "I did not call, my son; lie down again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, and the word of the LORD had not yet been revealed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, "Here I am, for you called me." Then Eli perceived that the LORD was calling the boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, "Go, lie down; and if he calls you, you shall say, `Speak, LORD, for thy servant hears.'" So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And the LORD came and stood forth, calling as at other times, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel said, "Speak, for thy servant hears."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>Then the LORD said to Samuel, "Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel, at which the two ears of every one that hears it will tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>On that day I will fulfil against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from beginning to end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>And I tell him that I am about to punish his house for ever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons were blaspheming God, and he did not restrain them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>Therefore I swear to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated by sacrifice or offering for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>Samuel lay until morning; then he opened the doors of the house of the LORD. And Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>But Eli called Samuel and said, "Samuel, my son." And he said, "Here I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And Eli said, "What was it that he told you? Do not hide it from me. May God do so to you and more also, if you hide anything from me of all that he told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>So Samuel told him everything and hid nothing from him. And he said, "It is the LORD; let him do what seems good to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him and let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel from Dan to Beer-sheba knew that Samuel was established as a prophet of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And the LORD appeared again at Shiloh, for the LORD revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel.  Now Israel went out to battle against the Philistines; they encamped at Ebene'zer, and the Philistines encamped at Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>The Philistines drew up in line against Israel, and when the battle spread, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who slew about four thousand men on the field of battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the troops came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why has the LORD put us to rout today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, that he may come among us and save us from the power of our enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, and brought from there the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, who is enthroned on the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin'ehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>When the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all Israel gave a mighty shout, so that the earth resounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shouting, they said, "What does this great shouting in the camp of the Hebrews mean?" And when they learned that the ark of the LORD had come to the camp,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>the Philistines were afraid; for they said, "A god has come into the camp." And they said, "Woe to us! For nothing like this has happened before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us! Who can deliver us from the power of these mighty gods? These are the gods who smote the Egyptians with every sort of plague in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Take courage, and acquit yourselves like men, O Philistines, lest you become slaves to the Hebrews as they have been to you; acquit yourselves like men and fight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>So the Philistines fought, and Israel was defeated, and they fled, every man to his home; and there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand foot soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was captured; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phin'ehas, were slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>A man of Benjamin ran from the battle line, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes rent and with earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>When he arrived, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the road watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city and told the news, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>When Eli heard the sound of the outcry, he said, "What is this uproar?" Then the man hastened and came and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old and his eyes were set, so that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said to Eli, "I am he who has come from the battle; I fled from the battle today." And he said, "How did it go, my son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>He who brought the tidings answered and said, "Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has also been a great slaughter among the people; your two sons also, Hophni and Phin'ehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been captured."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell over backward from his seat by the side of the gate; and his neck was broken and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. He had judged Israel forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>Now his daughter-in-law, the wife of Phin'ehas, was with child, about to give birth. And when she heard the tidings that the ark of God was captured, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed and gave birth; for her pains came upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And about the time of her death the women attending her said to her, "Fear not, for you have borne a son." But she did not answer or give heed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the child Ich'abod, saying, "The glory has departed from Israel!" because the ark of God had been captured and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God has been captured."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>When the Philistines captured the ark of God, they carried it from Ebene'zer to Ashdod;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>then the Philistines took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it up beside Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when the people of Ashdod rose early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and put him back in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>But when they rose early on the next morning, behold, Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and the head of Dagon and both his hands were lying cut off upon the threshold; only the trunk of Dagon was left to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>This is why the priests of Dagon and all who enter the house of Dagon do not tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>The hand of the LORD was heavy upon the people of Ashdod, and he terrified and afflicted them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>And when the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, "The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us; for his hand is heavy upon us and upon Dagon our god."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?" They answered, "Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath." So they brought the ark of the God of Israel there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.9'>But after they had brought it around, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing a very great panic, and he afflicted the men of the city, both young and old, so that tumors broke out upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.10'>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. But when the ark of God came to Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought around to us the ark of the God of Israel to slay us and our people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.11'>They sent therefore and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines, and said, "Send away the ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to its own place, that it may not slay us and our people."

        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.1'>The ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines seven months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.2'>And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners and said, "What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Tell us with what we shall send it to its place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.3'>They said, "If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty, but by all means return him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why his hand does not turn away from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.4'>And they said, "What is the guilt offering that we shall return to him?" They answered, "Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the Philistines; for the same plague was upon all of you and upon your lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.5'>So you must make images of your tumors and images of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps he will lighten his hand from off you and your gods and your land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.6'>Why should you harden your hearts as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? After he had made sport of them, did not they let the people go, and they departed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.7'>Now then, take and prepare a new cart and two milch cows upon which there has never come a yoke, and yoke the cows to the cart, but take their calves home, away from them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.12'>And the cows went straight in the direction of Beth-she'mesh along one highway, lowing as they went; they turned neither to the right nor to the left, and the lords of the Philistines went after them as far as the border of Beth-she'mesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.13'>Now the people of Beth-she'mesh were reaping their wheat harvest in the valley; and when they lifted up their eyes and saw the ark, they rejoiced to see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.6.14'>The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-she'mesh, and stopped there. A great stone was there; and they split up the wood of the cart and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.1'>And the men of Kir'iath-je'arim came and took up the ark of the LORD, and brought it to the house of Abin'adab on the hill; and they consecrated his son, Elea'zar, to have charge of the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.2'>From the day that the ark was lodged at Kir'iath-je'arim, a long time passed, some twenty years, and all the house of Israel lamented after the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.3'>Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, "If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, then put away the foreign gods and the Ash'taroth from among you, and direct your heart to the LORD, and serve him only, and he will deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.4'>So Israel put away the Ba'als and the Ash'taroth, and they served the LORD only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.5'>Then Samuel said, "Gather all Israel at Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.6'>So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and said there, "We have sinned against the LORD." And Samuel judged the people of Israel at Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.7'>Now when the Philistines heard that the people of Israel had gathered at Mizpah, the lords of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the people of Israel heard of it they were afraid of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.8'>And the people of Israel said to Samuel, "Do not cease to cry to the LORD our God for us, that he may save us from the hand of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.9'>So Samuel took a sucking lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD; and Samuel cried to the LORD for Israel, and the LORD answered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.10'>As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines drew near to attack Israel; but the LORD thundered with a mighty voice that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion; and they were routed before Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.11'>And the men of Israel went out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and smote them, as far as below Beth-car.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.12'>Then Samuel took a stone and set it up between Mizpah and Jesha'nah, and called its name Ebene'zer; for he said, "Hitherto the LORD has helped us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.13'>So the Philistines were subdued and did not again enter the territory of Israel. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.14'>The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel rescued their territory from the hand of the Philistines. There was peace also between Israel and the Amorites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.15'>Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.7.16'>And he went on a circuit year by year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah; and he judged Israel in all these places.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.1'>When Samuel became old, he made his sons judges over Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.3'>Yet his sons did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after gain; they took bribes and perverted justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.4'>Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.5'>and said to him, "Behold, you are old and your sons do not walk in your ways; now appoint for us a king to govern us like all the nations."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.6'>But the thing displeased Samuel when they said, "Give us a king to govern us." And Samuel prayed to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.7'>And the LORD said to Samuel, "Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to you; for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected me from being king over them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.10'>So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking a king from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.11'>He said, "These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them to his chariots and to be his horsemen, and to run before his chariots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.12'>and he will appoint for himself commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties, and some to plow his ground and to reap his harvest, and to make his implements of war and the equipment of his chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.13'>He will take your daughters to be perfumers and cooks and bakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.14'>He will take the best of your fields and vineyards and olive orchards and give them to his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.15'>He will take the tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.16'>He will take your menservants and maidservants, and the best of your cattle and your asses, and put them to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.17'>He will take the tenth of your flocks, and you shall be his slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.18'>And in that day you will cry out because of your king, whom you have chosen for yourselves; but the LORD will not answer you in that day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.19'>But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel; and they said, "No! but we will have a king over us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.20'>that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may govern us and go out before us and fight our battles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.21'>And when Samuel had heard all the words of the people, he repeated them in the ears of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.8.22'>And the LORD said to Samuel, "Hearken to their voice, and make them a king." Samuel then said to the men of Israel, "Go every man to his city."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.9'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.1'>There was a man of Benjamin whose name was Kish, the son of Abi'el, son of Zeror, son of Beco'rath, son of Aphi'ah, a Benjaminite, a man of wealth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.2'>and he had a son whose name was Saul, a handsome young man. There was not a man among the people of Israel more handsome than he; from his shoulders upward he was taller than any of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.3'>Now the asses of Kish, Saul's father, were lost. So Kish said to Saul his son, "Take one of the servants with you, and arise, go and look for the asses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.4'>And they passed through the hill country of E'phraim and passed through the land of Shal'ishah, but they did not find them. And they passed through the land of Sha'alim, but they were not there. Then they passed through the land of Benjamin, but did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.5'>When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, "Come, let us go back, lest my father cease to care about the asses and become anxious about us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.6'>But he said to him, "Behold, there is a man of God in this city, and he is a man that is held in honor; all that he says comes true. Let us go there; perhaps he can tell us about the journey on which we have set out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.7'>Then Saul said to his servant, "But if we go, what can we bring the man? For the bread in our sacks is gone, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What have we?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.8'>The servant answered Saul again, "Here, I have with me the fourth part of a shekel of silver, and I will give it to the man of God, to tell us our way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.9'>(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he said, "Come, let us go to the seer"; for he who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.10'>And Saul said to his servant, "Well said; come, let us go." So they went to the city where the man of God was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.11'>As they went up the hill to the city, they met young maidens coming out to draw water, and said to them, "Is the seer here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.12'>They answered, "He is; behold, he is just ahead of you. Make haste; he has come just now to the city, because the people have a sacrifice today on the high place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.13'>As soon as you enter the city, you will find him, before he goes up to the high place to eat; for the people will not eat till he comes, since he must bless the sacrifice; afterward those eat who are invited. Now go up, for you will meet him immediately."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.14'>So they went up to the city. As they were entering the city, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way up to the high place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.15'>Now the day before Saul came, the LORD had revealed to Samuel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.16'>"Tomorrow about this time I will send to you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him to be prince over my people Israel. He shall save my people from the hand of the Philistines; for I have seen the affliction of my people, because their cry has come to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.17'>When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD told him, "Here is the man of whom I spoke to you! He it is who shall rule over my people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.18'>Then Saul approached Samuel in the gate, and said, "Tell me where is the house of the seer?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.19'>Samuel answered Saul, "I am the seer; go up before me to the high place, for today you shall eat with me, and in the morning I will let you go and will tell you all that is on your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.20'>As for your asses that were lost three days ago, do not set your mind on them, for they have been found. And for whom is all that is desirable in Israel? Is it not for you and for all your father's house?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.21'>Saul answered, "Am I not a Benjaminite, from the least of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the humblest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken to me in this way?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.22'>Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall and gave them a place at the head of those who had been invited, who were about thirty persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.23'>And Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion I gave you, of which I said to you, `Put it aside.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.24'>So the cook took up the leg and the upper portion and set them before Saul; and Samuel said, "See, what was kept is set before you. Eat; because it was kept for you until the hour appointed, that you might eat with the guests."  So Saul ate with Samuel that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.25'>And when they came down from the high place into the city, a bed was spread for Saul upon the roof, and he lay down to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.26'>Then at the break of dawn Samuel called to Saul upon the roof, "Up, that I may send you on your way." So Saul arose, and both he and Samuel went out into the street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.9.27'>As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to pass on before us, and when he has passed on stop here yourself for a while, that I may make known to you the word of God."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.10'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.1'>Then Samuel took a vial of oil and poured it on his head, and kissed him and said, "Has not the LORD anointed you to be prince over his people Israel?

And this shall be the sign to you that the LORD has anointed you to be prince over his heritage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.2'>When you depart from me today you will meet two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah, and they will say to you, `The asses which you went to seek are found, and now your father has ceased to care about the asses and is anxious about you, saying, "What shall I do about my son?"'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.3'>Then you shall go on from there further and come to the oak of Tabor; three men going up to God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three kids, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a skin of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.4'>And they will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you shall accept from their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.5'>After that you shall come to Gib'e-ath-elo'him, where there is a garrison of the Philistines; and there, as you come to the city, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, prophesying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.6'>Then the spirit of the LORD will come mightily upon you, and you shall prophesy with them and be turned into another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.7'>Now when these signs meet you, do whatever your hand finds to do, for God is with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.8'>And you shall go down before me to Gilgal; and behold, I am coming to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. Seven days you shall wait, until I come to you and show you what you shall do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.9'>When he turned his back to leave Samuel, God gave him another heart; and all these signs came to pass that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.10'>When they came to Gib'e-ah, behold, a band of prophets met him; and the spirit of God came mightily upon him, and he prophesied among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.11'>And when all who knew him before saw how he prophesied with the prophets, the people said to one another, "What has come over the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.12'>And a man of the place answered, "And who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.14'>Saul's uncle said to him and to his servant, "Where did you go?" And he said, "To seek the asses; and when we saw they were not to be found, we went to Samuel."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.16'>And Saul said to his uncle, "He told us plainly that the asses had been found." But about the matter of the kingdom, of which Samuel had spoken, he did not tell him anything.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.10.22'>So they inquired again of the LORD, "Did the man come hither?" and the LORD said, "Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.8'>When he mustered them at Bezek, the men of Israel were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.9'>And they said to the messengers who had come, "Thus shall you say to the men of Ja'besh-gil'ead: `Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you shall have deliverance.'" When the messengers came and told the men of Jabesh, they were glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.10'>Therefore the men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will give ourselves up to you, and you may do to us whatever seems good to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.11'>And on the morrow Saul put the people in three companies; and they came into the midst of the camp in the morning watch, and cut down the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and those who survived were scattered, so that no two of them were left together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.12'>Then the people said to Samuel, "Who is it that said, `Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring the men, that we may put them to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.13'>But Saul said, "Not a man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has wrought deliverance in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.14'>Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us go to Gilgal and there renew the kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.11.15'>So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.1'>Saul was . . . years old when he began to reign; and he reigned . . . and two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.2'>Saul chose three thousand men of Israel; two thousand were with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, and a thousand were with Jonathan in Gib'e-ah of Benjamin; the rest of the people he sent home, every man to his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>Jonathan defeated the garrison of the Philistines which was at Geba; and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, "Let the Hebrews hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>And all Israel heard it said that Saul had defeated the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel had become odious to the Philistines. And the people were called out to join Saul at Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>And the Philistines mustered to fight with Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and troops like the sand on the seashore in multitude; they came up and encamped in Michmash, to the east of Beth-a'ven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>When the men of Israel saw that they were in straits (for the people were hard pressed), the people hid themselves in caves and in holes and in rocks and in tombs and in cisterns,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>or crossed the fords of the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.8'>He waited seven days, the time appointed by Samuel; but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattering from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.9'>So Saul said, "Bring the burnt offering here to me, and the peace offerings." And he offered the burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.10'>As soon as he had finished offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul went out to meet him and salute him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.11'>Samuel said, "What have you done?" And Saul said, "When I saw that the people were scattering from me, and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered at Michmash,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>I said, `Now the Philistines will come down upon me at Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of the LORD'; so I forced myself, and offered the burnt offering."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>And Samuel said to Saul, "You have done foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which he commanded you; for now the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.14'>But now your kingdom shall not continue; the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart; and the LORD has appointed him to be prince over his people, because you have not kept what the LORD commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.15'>And Samuel arose, and went up from Gilgal to Gib'e-ah of Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people who were present with him, about six hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.16'>And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people who were present with them, stayed in Geba of Benjamin; but the Philistines encamped in Michmash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.17'>And raiders came out of the camp of the Philistines in three companies; one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shu'al,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.18'>another company turned toward Beth-hor'on, and another company turned toward the border that looks down upon the valley of Zebo'im toward the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.19'>Now there was no smith to be found throughout all the land of Israel; for the Philistines said, "Lest the Hebrews make themselves swords or spears";</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.20'>but every one of the Israelites went down to the Philistines to sharpen his plowshare, his mattock, his axe, or his sickle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.21'>and the charge was a pim for the plowshares and for the mattocks, and a third of a shekel for sharpening the axes and for setting the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.22'>So on the day of the battle there was neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.23'>And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass of Michmash.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.1'>One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on yonder side." But he did not tell his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.2'>Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gib'e-ah under the pomegranate tree which is at Migron; the people who were with him were about six hundred men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.3'>and Ahi'jah the son of Ahi'tub, Ich'abod's brother, son of Phin'ehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>In the pass, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.5'>The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the LORD will work for us; for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.7'>And his armor-bearer said to him, "Do all that your mind inclines to; behold, I am with you, as is your mind so is mine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.8'>Then said Jonathan, "Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.9'>If they say to us, `Wait until we come to you,' then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.10'>But if they say, `Come up to us,' then we will go up; for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.11'>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, "Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hid themselves."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.12'>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing." And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Come up after me; for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>and that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was of about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked; and it became a very great panic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.16'>And the watchmen of Saul in Gib'e-ah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude was surging hither and thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.17'>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, "Number and see who has gone from us." And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.18'>And Saul said to Ahi'jah, "Bring hither the ark of God." For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.19'>And while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more; and Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.20'>Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.21'>Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.22'>Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of E'phraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.23'>So the LORD delivered Israel that day; and the battle passed beyond Beth-a'ven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.24'>And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul laid an oath on the people, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies." So none of the people tasted food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.25'>And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.26'>And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.27'>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; so he put forth the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes became bright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.28'>Then one of the people said, "Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, `Cursed be the man who eats food this day.'" And the people were faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.29'>Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land; see how my eyes have become bright, because I tasted a little of this honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.30'>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found; for now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.31'>They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ai'jalon. And the people were very faint;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.32'>the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.33'>Then they told Saul, "Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD, by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.34'>And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, `Let every man bring his ox or his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.35'>And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.36'>Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them." And they said, "Do whatever seems good to you." But the priest said, "Let us draw near hither to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.37'>And Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.38'>And Saul said, "Come hither, all you leaders of the people; and know and see how this sin has arisen today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.39'>For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.40'>Then he said to all Israel, "You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." And the people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.41'>Therefore Saul said, "O LORD God of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim; but if this guilt is in thy people Israel, give Thummim." And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.42'>Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan." And Jonathan was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.43'>Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." And Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand; here I am, I will die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.44'>And Saul said, "God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.45'>Then the people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day." So the people ransomed Jonathan, that he did not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.46'>Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.47'>When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; wherever he turned he put them to the worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.48'>And he did valiantly, and smote the Amal'ekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.49'>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Mal'chishu'a; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.50'>and the name of Saul's wife was Ahin'o-am the daughter of Ahim'a-az. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.51'>Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abi'el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.52'>There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.1'>And Samuel said to Saul, "The LORD sent me to anoint you king over his people Israel; now therefore hearken to the words of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.2'>Thus says the LORD of hosts, `I will punish what Am'alek did to Israel in opposing them on the way, when they came up out of Egypt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.4'>So Saul summoned the people, and numbered them in Tela'im, two hundred thousand men on foot, and ten thousand men of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.5'>And Saul came to the city of Am'alek, and lay in wait in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.6'>And Saul said to the Ken'ites, "Go, depart, go down from among the Amal'ekites, lest I destroy you with them; for you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up out of Egypt." So the Ken'ites departed from among the Amal'ekites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.7'>And Saul defeated the Amal'ekites, from Hav'ilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.9'>But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the sheep and of the oxen and of the fatlings, and the lambs, and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them; all that was despised and worthless they utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.10'>The word of the LORD came to Samuel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.11'>"I repent that I have made Saul king; for he has turned back from following me, and has not performed my commandments." And Samuel was angry; and he cried to the LORD all night.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.23'>For rebellion is as the sin of divination, and stubbornness is as iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the LORD, he has also rejected you from being king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.24'>And Saul said to Samuel, "I have sinned; for I have transgressed the commandment of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.26'>And Samuel said to Saul, "I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.27'>As Samuel turned to go away, Saul laid hold upon the skirt of his robe, and it tore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.15.28'>And Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you this day, and has given it to a neighbor of yours, who is better than you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.40'>Then he took his staff in his hand, and chose five smooth stones from the brook, and put them in his shepherd's bag or wallet; his sling was in his hand, and he drew near to the Philistine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.46'>This day the LORD will deliver you into my hand, and I will strike you down, and cut off your head; and I will give the dead bodies of the host of the Philistines this day to the birds of the air and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.47'>and that all this assembly may know that the LORD saves not with sword and spear; for the battle is the LORD'S and he will give you into our hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.48'>When the Philistine arose and came and drew near to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.49'>And David put his hand in his bag and took out a stone, and slung it, and struck the Philistine on his forehead; the stone sank into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.50'>So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a stone, and struck the Philistine, and killed him; there was no sword in the hand of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.51'>Then David ran and stood over the Philistine, and took his sword and drew it out of its sheath, and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.52'>And the men of Israel and Judah rose with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as Gath and the gates of Ekron, so that the wounded Philistines fell on the way from Sha-ara'im as far as Gath and Ekron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.53'>And the Israelites came back from chasing the Philistines, and they plundered their camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.54'>And David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem; but he put his armor in his tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.55'>When Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he said to Abner, the commander of the army, "Abner, whose son is this youth?" And Abner said, "As your soul lives, O king, I cannot tell."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.56'>And the king said, "Inquire whose son the stripling is."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.17.57'>And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine, Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.5'>for he took his life in his hand and he slew the Philistine, and the LORD wrought a great victory for all Israel. You saw it, and rejoiced; why then will you sin against innocent blood by killing David without cause?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.6'>And Saul hearkened to the voice of Jonathan; Saul swore, "As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.7'>And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan showed him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.8'>And there was war again; and David went out and fought with the Philistines, and made a great slaughter among them, so that they fled before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.9'>Then an evil spirit from the LORD came upon Saul, as he sat in his house with his spear in his hand; and David was playing the lyre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.10'>And Saul sought to pin David to the wall with the spear; but he eluded Saul, so that he struck the spear into the wall. And David fled, and escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.11'>That night Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him, that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David's wife, told him, "If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.12'>So Michal let David down through the window; and he fled away and escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.13'>Michal took an image and laid it on the bed and put a pillow of goats' hair at its head, and covered it with the clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.14'>And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, "He is sick."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.15'>Then Saul sent the messengers to see David, saying, "Bring him up to me in the bed, that I may kill him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.16'>And when the messengers came in, behold, the image was in the bed, with the pillow of goats' hair at its head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.17'>Saul said to Michal, "Why have you deceived me thus, and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?" And Michal answered Saul, "He said to me, `Let me go; why should I kill you?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.18'>Now David fled and escaped, and he came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him all that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and dwelt at Nai'oth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.19'>And it was told Saul, "Behold, David is at Nai'oth in Ramah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.20'>Then Saul sent messengers to take David; and when they saw the company of the prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing as head over them, the Spirit of God came upon the messengers of Saul, and they also prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.21'>When it was told Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. And Saul sent messengers again the third time, and they also prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.22'>Then he himself went to Ramah, and came to the great well that is in Secu; and he asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" And one said, "Behold, they are at Nai'oth in Ramah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.23'>And he went from there to Nai'oth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him also, and as he went he prophesied, until he came to Nai'oth in Ramah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.19.24'>And he too stripped off his clothes, and he too prophesied before Samuel, and lay naked all that day and all that night. Hence it is said, "Is Saul also among the prophets?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.20'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.1'>Then David fled from Nai'oth in Ramah, and came and said before Jonathan, "What have I done? What is my guilt? And what is my sin before your father, that he seeks my life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.2'>And he said to him, "Far from it! You shall not die. Behold, my father does nothing either great or small without disclosing it to me; and why should my father hide this from me? It is not so."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.3'>But David replied, "Your father knows well that I have found favor in your eyes; and he thinks, `Let not Jonathan know this, lest he be grieved.' But truly, as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is but a step between me and death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.4'>Then said Jonathan to David, "Whatever you say, I will do for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.5'>David said to Jonathan, "Behold, tomorrow is the new moon, and I should not fail to sit at table with the king; but let me go, that I may hide myself in the field till the third day at evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.6'>If your father misses me at all, then say, `David earnestly asked leave of me to run to Bethlehem his city; for there is a yearly sacrifice there for all the family.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.7'>If he says, `Good!' it will be well with your servant; but if he is angry, then know that evil is determined by him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.9'>And Jonathan said, "Far be it from you! If I knew that it was determined by my father that evil should come upon you, would I not tell you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.10'>Then said David to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you roughly?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.11'>And Jonathan said to David, "Come, let us go out into the field." So they both went out into the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.12'>And Jonathan said to David, "The LORD, the God of Israel, be witness! When I have sounded my father, about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he is well disposed toward David, shall I not then send and disclose it to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.13'>But should it please my father to do you harm, the LORD do so to Jonathan, and more also, if I do not disclose it to you, and send you away, that you may go in safety. May the LORD be with you, as he has been with my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.14'>If I am still alive, show me the loyal love of the LORD, that I may not die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.15'>and do not cut off your loyalty from my house for ever. When the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>And Jonathan made David swear again by his love for him; for he loved him as he loved his own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>Then Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon; and you will be missed, because your seat will be empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>And on the third day you will be greatly missed; then go to the place where you hid yourself when the matter was in hand, and remain beside yonder stone heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.20'>And I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.21'>And behold, I will send the lad, saying, `Go, find the arrows.' If I say to the lad, `Look, the arrows are on this side of you, take them,' then you are to come, for, as the LORD lives, it is safe for you and there is no danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.22'>But if I say to the youth, `Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then go; for the LORD has sent you away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.23'>And as for the matter of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.24'>So David hid himself in the field; and when the new moon came, the king sat down to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.25'>The king sat upon his seat, as at other times, upon the seat by the wall; Jonathan sat opposite, and Abner sat by Saul's side, but David's place was empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.26'>Yet Saul did not say anything that day; for he thought, "Something has befallen him; he is not clean, surely he is not clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.27'>But on the second day, the morrow after the new moon, David's place was empty. And Saul said to Jonathan his son, "Why has not the son of Jesse come to the meal, either yesterday or today?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.28'>Jonathan answered Saul, "David earnestly asked leave of me to go to Bethlehem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.29'>he said, `Let me go; for our family holds a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to be there. So now, if I have found favor in your eyes, let me get away, and see my brothers.' For this reason he has not come to the king's table."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, "You son of a perverse, rebellious woman, do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother's nakedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the earth, neither you nor your kingdom shall be established. Therefore send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>Then Jonathan answered Saul his father, "Why should he be put to death? What has he done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>But Saul cast his spear at him to smite him; so Jonathan knew that his father was determined to put David to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>And Jonathan rose from the table in fierce anger and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David, because his father had disgraced him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>In the morning Jonathan went out into the field to the appointment with David, and with him a little lad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said to his lad, "Run and find the arrows which I shoot." As the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.37'>And when the lad came to the place of the arrow which Jonathan had shot, Jonathan called after the lad and said, "Is not the arrow beyond you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.38'>And Jonathan called after the lad, "Hurry, make haste, stay not." So Jonathan's lad gathered up the arrows, and came to his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.39'>But the lad knew nothing; only Jonathan and David knew the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.40'>And Jonathan gave his weapons to his lad, and said to him, "Go and carry them to the city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>And as soon as the lad had gone, David rose from beside the stone heap and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed three times; and they kissed one another, and wept with one another, until David recovered himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.42'>Then Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, forasmuch as we have sworn both of us in the name of the LORD, saying, `The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants, for ever.'" And he rose and departed; and Jonathan went into the city.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.21'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.1'>Then came David to Nob to Ahim'elech the priest; and Ahim'elech came to meet David trembling, and said to him, "Why are you alone, and no one with you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.2'>And David said to Ahim'elech the priest, "The king has charged me with a matter, and said to me, `Let no one know anything of the matter about which I send you, and with which I have charged you.' I have made an appointment with the young men for such and such a place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.3'>Now then, what have you at hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever is here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.4'>And the priest answered David, "I have no common bread at hand, but there is holy bread; if only the young men have kept themselves from women."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.5'>And David answered the priest, "Of a truth women have been kept from us as always when I go on an expedition; the vessels of the young men are holy, even when it is a common journey; how much more today will their vessels be holy?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.6'>So the priest gave him the holy bread; for there was no bread there but the bread of the Presence, which is removed from before the LORD, to be replaced by hot bread on the day it is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.7'>Now a certain man of the servants of Saul was there that day, detained before the LORD; his name was Do'eg the E'domite, the chief of Saul's herdsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.8'>And David said to Ahim'elech, "And have you not here a spear or a sword at hand? For I have brought neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's business required haste."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.9'>And the priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah, behold, it is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you will take that, take it, for there is none but that here." And David said, "There is none like that; give it to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.10'>And David rose and fled that day from Saul, and went to A'chish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.11'>And the servants of A'chish said to him, "Is not this David the king of the land? Did they not sing to one another of him in dances, `Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.12'>And David took these words to heart, and was much afraid of A'chish the king of Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.13'>So he changed his behavior before them, and feigned himself mad in their hands, and made marks on the doors of the gate, and let his spittle run down his beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.14'>Then said A'chish to his servants, "Lo, you see the man is mad; why then have you brought him to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.21.15'>Do I lack madmen, that you have brought this fellow to play the madman in my presence? Shall this fellow come into my house?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.1'>David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father's house heard it, they went down there to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.2'>And every one who was in distress, and every one who was in debt, and every one who was discontented, gathered to him; and he became captain over them. And there were with him about four hundred men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.3'>And David went from there to Mizpeh of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, "Pray let my father and my mother stay with you, till I know what God will do for me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.4'>And he left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.5'>Then the prophet Gad said to David, "Do not remain in the stronghold; depart, and go into the land of Judah." So David departed, and went into the forest of Hereth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.6'>Now Saul heard that David was discovered, and the men who were with him. Saul was sitting at Gib'e-ah, under the tamarisk tree on the height, with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.7'>And Saul said to his servants who stood about him, "Hear now, you Benjaminites; will the son of Jesse give every one of you fields and vineyards, will he make you all commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.13'>And Saul said to him, "Why have you conspired against me, you and the son of Jesse, in that you have given him bread and a sword, and have inquired of God for him, so that he has risen against me, to lie in wait, as at this day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.14'>Then Ahim'elech answered the king, "And who among all your servants is so faithful as David, who is the king's son-in-law, and captain over your bodyguard, and honored in your house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.15'>Is today the first time that I have inquired of God for him? No! Let not the king impute anything to his servant or to all the house of my father; for your servant has known nothing of all this, much or little."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.18'>Then the king said to Do'eg, "You turn and fall upon the priests." And Do'eg the E'domite turned and fell upon the priests, and he killed on that day eighty-five persons who wore the linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.22.19'>And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both men and women, children and sucklings, oxen, asses and sheep, he put to the sword.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.1'>When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, "Behold, David is in the wilderness of En-ge'di."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.2'>Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel, and went to seek David and his men in front of the Wildgoats' Rocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.3'>And he came to the sheepfolds by the way, where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the innermost parts of the cave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.4'>And the men of David said to him, "Here is the day of which the LORD said to you, `Behold, I will give your enemy into your hand, and you shall do to him as it shall seem good to you.'" Then David arose and stealthily cut off the skirt of Saul's robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.5'>And afterward David's heart smote him, because he had cut off Saul's skirt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.6'>He said to his men, "The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my lord, the LORD'S anointed, to put forth my hand against him, seeing he is the LORD'S anointed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.7'>So David persuaded his men with these words, and did not permit them to attack Saul. And Saul rose up and left the cave, and went upon his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.8'>Afterward David also arose, and went out of the cave, and called after Saul, "My lord the king!" And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the earth, and did obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.9'>And David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of men who say, `Behold, David seeks your hurt'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.10'>Lo, this day your eyes have seen how the LORD gave you today into my hand in the cave; and some bade me kill you, but I spared you. I said, `I will not put forth my hand against my lord; for he is the LORD'S anointed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.11'>See, my father, see the skirt of your robe in my hand; for by the fact that I cut off the skirt of your robe, and did not kill you, you may know and see that there is no wrong or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you hunt my life to take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.12'>May the LORD judge between me and you, may the LORD avenge me upon you; but my hand shall not be against you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.16'>When David had finished speaking these words to Saul, Saul said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And Saul lifted up his voice and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.17'>He said to David, "You are more righteous than I; for you have repaid me good, whereas I have repaid you evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.24.18'>And you have declared this day how you have dealt well with me, in that you did not kill me when the LORD put me into your hands.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Sam.25'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.1'>Now Samuel died; and all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him in his house at Ramah.  Then David rose and went down to the wilderness of Paran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.2'>And there was a man in Ma'on, whose business was in Carmel. The man was very rich; he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats. He was shearing his sheep in Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.3'>Now the name of the man was Nabal, and the name of his wife Ab'igail. The woman was of good understanding and beautiful, but the man was churlish and ill-behaved; he was a Calebite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.4'>David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.5'>So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, "Go up to Carmel, and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.6'>And thus you shall salute him: `Peace be to you, and peace be to your house, and peace be to all that you have.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.8'>Ask your young men, and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your eyes; for we come on a feast day. Pray, give whatever you have at hand to your servants and to your son David.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.9'>When David's young men came, they said all this to Nabal in the name of David; and then they waited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.10'>And Nabal answered David's servants, "Who is David? Who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants nowadays who are breaking away from their masters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.11'>Shall I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have killed for my shearers, and give it to men who come from I do not know where?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.12'>So David's young men turned away, and came back and told him all this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.13'>And David said to his men, "Every man gird on his sword!" And every man of them girded on his sword; David also girded on his sword; and about four hundred men went up after David, while two hundred remained with the baggage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.14'>But one of the young men told Ab'igail, Nabal's wife, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master; and he railed at them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.15'>Yet the men were very good to us, and we suffered no harm, and we did not miss anything when we were in the fields, as long as we went with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.16'>they were a wall to us both by night and by day, all the while we were with them keeping the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.17'>Now therefore know this and consider what you should do; for evil is determined against our master and against all his house, and he is so ill-natured that one cannot speak to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.18'>Then Ab'igail made haste, and took two hundred loaves, and two skins of wine, and five sheep ready dressed, and five measures of parched grain, and a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and laid them on asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.19'>And she said to her young men, "Go on before me; behold, I come after you." But she did not tell her husband Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.20'>And as she rode on the ass, and came down under cover of the mountain, behold, David and his men came down toward her; and she met them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.21'>Now David had said, "Surely in vain have I guarded all that this fellow has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missed of all that belonged to him; and he has returned me evil for good.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.24'>She fell at his feet and said, "Upon me alone, my lord, be the guilt; pray let your handmaid speak in your ears, and hear the words of your handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.25'>Let not my lord regard this ill-natured fellow, Nabal; for as his name is, so is he; Nabal is his name, and folly is with him; but I your handmaid did not see the young men of my lord, whom you sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.26'>Now then, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, seeing the LORD has restrained you from bloodguilt, and from taking vengeance with your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord be as Nabal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.27'>And now let this present which your servant has brought to my lord be given to the young men who follow my lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.28'>Pray forgive the trespass of your handmaid; for the LORD will certainly make my lord a sure house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD; and evil shall not be found in you so long as you live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.29'>If men rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of the living in the care of the LORD your God; and the lives of your enemies he shall sling out as from the hollow of a sling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.30'>And when the LORD has done to my lord according to all the good that he has spoken concerning you, and has appointed you prince over Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.31'>my lord shall have no cause of grief, or pangs of conscience, for having shed blood without cause or for my lord taking vengeance himself. And when the LORD has dealt well with my lord, then remember your handmaid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.32'>And David said to Ab'igail, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you this day to meet me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.33'>Blessed be your discretion, and blessed be you, who have kept me this day from bloodguilt and from avenging myself with my own hand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.34'>For as surely as the LORD the God of Israel lives, who has restrained me from hurting you, unless you had made haste and come to meet me, truly by morning there had not been left to Nabal so much as one male."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.35'>Then David received from her hand what she had brought him; and he said to her, "Go up in peace to your house; see, I have hearkened to your voice, and I have granted your petition."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.36'>And Ab'igail came to Nabal; and, lo, he was holding a feast in his house, like the feast of a king. And Nabal's heart was merry within him, for he was very drunk; so she told him nothing at all until the morning light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.37'>And in the morning, when the wine had gone out of Nabal, his wife told him these things, and his heart died within him, and he became as a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.38'>And about ten days later the LORD smote Nabal; and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.39'>When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Blessed be the LORD who has avenged the insult I received at the hand of Nabal, and has kept back his servant from evil; the LORD has returned the evil-doing of Nabal upon his own head." Then David sent and wooed Ab'igail, to make her his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.40'>And when the servants of David came to Ab'igail at Carmel, they said to her, "David has sent us to you to take you to him as his wife."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.42'>And Ab'igail made haste and rose and mounted on an ass, and her five maidens attended her; she went after the messengers of David, and became his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.25.43'>David also took Ahin'o-am of Jezreel; and both of them became his wives.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.1'>Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gib'e-ah, saying, "Is not David hiding himself on the hill of Hachi'lah, which is on the east of Jeshi'mon?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.2'>So Saul arose and went down to the wilderness of Ziph, with three thousand chosen men of Israel, to seek David in the wilderness of Ziph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.3'>And Saul encamped on the hill of Hachi'lah, which is beside the road on the east of Jeshi'mon. But David remained in the wilderness; and when he saw that Saul came after him into the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.4'>David sent out spies, and learned of a certainty that Saul had come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.5'>Then David rose and came to the place where Saul had encamped; and David saw the place where Saul lay, with Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; Saul was lying within the encampment, while the army was encamped around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.6'>Then David said to Ahim'elech the Hittite, and to Jo'ab's brother Abi'shai the son of Zeru'iah, "Who will go down with me into the camp to Saul?" And Abi'shai said, "I will go down with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.7'>So David and Abi'shai went to the army by night; and there lay Saul sleeping within the encampment, with his spear stuck in the ground at his head; and Abner and the army lay around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.8'>Then said Abi'shai to David, "God has given your enemy into your hand this day; now therefore let me pin him to the earth with one stroke of the spear, and I will not strike him twice."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.9'>But David said to Abi'shai, "Do not destroy him; for who can put forth his hand against the LORD'S anointed, and be guiltless?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.10'>And David said, "As the LORD lives, the LORD will smite him; or his day shall come to die; or he shall go down into battle and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.11'>The LORD forbid that I should put forth my hand against the LORD'S anointed; but take now the spear that is at his head, and the jar of water, and let us go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.12'>So David took the spear and the jar of water from Saul's head; and they went away. No man saw it, or knew it, nor did any awake; for they were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.13'>Then David went over to the other side, and stood afar off on the top of the mountain, with a great space between them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.14'>and David called to the army, and to Abner the son of Ner, saying, "Will you not answer, Abner?" Then Abner answered, "Who are you that calls to the king?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.15'>And David said to Abner, "Are you not a man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not kept watch over your lord the king? For one of the people came in to destroy the king your lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.16'>This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you deserve to die, because you have not kept watch over your lord, the LORD'S anointed. And now see where the king's spear is, and the jar of water that was at his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.26.17'>Saul recognized David's voice, and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" And David said, "It is my voice, my lord, O king."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.8'>Now David and his men went up, and made raids upon the Gesh'urites, the Gir'zites, and the Amal'ekites; for these were the inhabitants of the land from of old, as far as Shur, to the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.27.9'>And David smote the land, and left neither man nor woman alive, but took away the sheep, the oxen, the asses, the camels, and the garments, and came back to A'chish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.18'>Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD, and did not carry out his fierce wrath against Am'alek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.19'>Moreover the LORD will give Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow you and your sons shall be with me; the LORD will give the army of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.20'>Then Saul fell at once full length upon the ground, filled with fear because of the words of Samuel; and there was no strength in him, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.21'>And the woman came to Saul, and when she saw that he was terrified, she said to him, "Behold, your handmaid has hearkened to you; I have taken my life in my hand, and have hearkened to what you have said to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.22'>Now therefore, you also hearken to your handmaid; let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength when you go on your way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.23'>He refused, and said, "I will not eat." But his servants, together with the woman, urged him; and he hearkened to their words. So he arose from the earth, and sat upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.24'>Now the woman had a fatted calf in the house, and she quickly killed it, and she took flour, and kneaded it and baked unleavened bread of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.28.25'>and she put it before Saul and his servants; and they ate. Then they rose and went away that night.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.29'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.1'>Now the Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek; and the Israelites were encamped by the fountain which is in Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.2'>As the lords of the Philistines were passing on by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were passing on in the rear with A'chish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.3'>the commanders of the Philistines said, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" And A'chish said to the commanders of the Philistines, "Is not this David, the servant of Saul, king of Israel, who has been with me now for days and years, and since he deserted to me I have found no fault in him to this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.4'>But the commanders of the Philistines were angry with him; and the commanders of the Philistines said to him, "Send the man back, that he may return to the place to which you have assigned him; he shall not go down with us to battle, lest in the battle he become an adversary to us. For how could this fellow reconcile himself to his lord? Would it not be with the heads of the men here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.5'>Is not this David, of whom they sing to one another in dances, `Saul has slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.6'>Then A'chish called David and said to him, "As the LORD lives, you have been honest, and to me it seems right that you should march out and in with me in the campaign; for I have found nothing wrong in you from the day of your coming to me to this day. Nevertheless the lords do not approve of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.7'>So go back now; and go peaceably, that you may not displease the lords of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.8'>And David said to A'chish, "But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day I entered your service until now, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.9'>And A'chish made answer to David, "I know that you are as blameless in my sight as an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, `He shall not go up with us to the battle.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.10'>Now then rise early in the morning with the servants of your lord who came with you; and start early in the morning, and depart as soon as you have light."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.29.11'>So David set out with his men early in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.30'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.1'>Now when David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amal'ekites had made a raid upon the Negeb and upon Ziklag. They had overcome Ziklag, and burned it with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.2'>and taken captive the women and all who were in it, both small and great; they killed no one, but carried them off, and went their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.3'>And when David and his men came to the city, they found it burned with fire, and their wives and sons and daughters taken captive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.4'>Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept, until they had no more strength to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.5'>David's two wives also had been taken captive, Ahin'o-am of Jezreel, and Ab'igail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.6'>And David was greatly distressed; for the people spoke of stoning him, because all the people were bitter in soul, each for his sons and daughters. But David strengthened himself in the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.7'>And David said to Abi'athar the priest, the son of Ahim'elech, "Bring me the ephod." So Abi'athar brought the ephod to David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.8'>And David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I pursue after this band? Shall I overtake them?" He answered him, "Pursue; for you shall surely overtake and shall surely rescue."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.9'>So David set out, and the six hundred men who were with him, and they came to the brook Besor, where those stayed who were left behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.10'>But David went on with the pursuit, he and four hundred men; two hundred stayed behind, who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.11'>They found an Egyptian in the open country, and brought him to David; and they gave him bread and he ate, they gave him water to drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.12'>and they gave him a piece of a cake of figs and two clusters of raisins. And when he had eaten, his spirit revived; for he had not eaten bread or drunk water for three days and three nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.13'>And David said to him, "To whom do you belong? And where are you from?" He said, "I am a young man of Egypt, servant to an Amal'ekite; and my master left me behind because I fell sick three days ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.14'>We had made a raid upon the Negeb of the Cher'ethites and upon that which belongs to Judah and upon the Negeb of Caleb; and we burned Ziklag with fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.15'>And David said to him, "Will you take me down to this band?" And he said, "Swear to me by God, that you will not kill me, or deliver me into the hands of my master, and I will take you down to this band."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.16'>And when he had taken him down, behold, they were spread abroad over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing, because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.17'>And David smote them from twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men, who mounted camels and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.18'>David recovered all that the Amal'ekites had taken; and David rescued his two wives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.19'>Nothing was missing, whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken; David brought back all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.20'>David also captured all the flocks and herds; and the people drove those cattle before him, and said, "This is David's spoil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.21'>Then David came to the two hundred men, who had been too exhausted to follow David, and who had been left at the brook Besor; and they went out to meet David and to meet the people who were with him; and when David drew near to the people he saluted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.22'>Then all the wicked and base fellows among the men who had gone with David said, "Because they did not go with us, we will not give them any of the spoil which we have recovered, except that each man may lead away his wife and children, and depart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.23'>But David said, "You shall not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us; he has preserved us and given into our hand the band that came against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.24'>Who would listen to you in this matter? For as his share is who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the baggage; they shall share alike."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.25'>And from that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.26'>When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to his friends, the elders of Judah, saying, "Here is a present for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD";</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.27'>it was for those in Bethel, in Ramoth of the Negeb, in Jattir,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.28'>in Aro'er, in Siphmoth, in Eshtemo'a,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.29'>in Racal, in the cities of the Jerah'meelites, in the cities of the Ken'ites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.30'>in Hormah, in Borash'an, in A'thach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.30.31'>in Hebron, for all the places where David and his men had roamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.31'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.1'>Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of Israel fled before the Philistines, and fell slain on Mount Gilbo'a.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.2'>And the Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan and Abin'adab and Mal'chishu'a, the sons of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.3'>The battle pressed hard upon Saul, and the archers found him; and he was badly wounded by the archers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.4'>Then Saul said to his armor-bearer, "Draw your sword, and thrust me through with it, lest these uncircumcised come and thrust me through, and make sport of me." But his armor-bearer would not; for he feared greatly. Therefore Saul took his own sword, and fell upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.5'>And when his armor-bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell upon his sword, and died with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.6'>Thus Saul died, and his three sons, and his armor-bearer, and all his men, on the same day together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.7'>And when the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley and those beyond the Jordan saw that the men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they forsook their cities and fled; and the Philistines came and dwelt in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.8'>On the morrow, when the Philistines came to strip the slain, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilbo'a.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.9'>And they cut off his head, and stripped off his armor, and sent messengers throughout the land of the Philistines, to carry the good news to their idols and to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.10'>They put his armor in the temple of Ash'taroth; and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.11'>But when the inhabitants of Ja'besh-gil'ead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.12'>all the valiant men arose, and went all night, and took the body of Saul and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan; and they came to Jabesh and burnt them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.31.13'>And they took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted seven days.</verse>
