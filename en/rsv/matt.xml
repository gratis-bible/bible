      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Ram the father of Ammin'adab, and Ammin'adab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon the father of Bo'az by Rahab, and Bo'az the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse the father of David the king.  And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uri'ah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon the father of Rehobo'am, and Rehobo'am the father of Abi'jah, and Abi'jah the father of Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa the father of Jehosh'aphat, and Jehosh'aphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzzi'ah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzzi'ah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezeki'ah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Hezeki'ah the father of Manas'seh, and Manas'seh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josi'ah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josi'ah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoni'ah was the father of She-al'ti-el, and She-al'ti-el the father of Zerub'babel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zerub'babel the father of Abi'ud, and Abi'ud the father of Eli'akim, and Eli'akim the father of Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eli'ud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eli'ud the father of Elea'zar, and Elea'zar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>and her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But as he considered this, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>she will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>All this took place to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>"Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel" (which means, God with us).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>but knew her not until she had borne a son; and he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>"Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star in the East, and have come to worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea; for so it is written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>`And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will govern my people Israel.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star appeared;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, "Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him bring me word, that I too may come and worship him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they had heard the king they went their way; and lo, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came to rest over the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>and going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there till I tell you; for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And he rose and took the child and his mother by night, and departed to Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfil what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt have I called my son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, was in a furious rage, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>"A voice was heard in Ramah, wailing and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be consoled, because they were no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>"Rise, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he rose and took the child and his mother, and went to the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus reigned over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he went and dwelt in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled, "He shall be called a Nazarene."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>"Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John wore a garment of camel's hair, and a leather girdle around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sad'ducees coming for baptism, he said to them, "You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bear fruit that befits repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not presume to say to yourselves, `We have Abraham as our father'; for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees; every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>"I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry; he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the granary, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>John would have prevented him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered him, "Let it be so now; for thus it is fitting for us to fulfil all righteousness." Then he consented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And when Jesus was baptized, he went up immediately from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and alighting on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>and lo, a voice from heaven, saying, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And he fasted forty days and forty nights, and afterward he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered, "It is written, `Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him to the holy city, and set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written, `He will give his angels charge of you,' and `On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, `You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and he said to him, "All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, "Begone, Satan! for it is written, `You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and leaving Nazareth he went and dwelt in Caper'na-um by the sea, in the territory of Zeb'ulun and Naph'tali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>"The land of Zeb'ulun and the land of Naph'tali, toward the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light, and for those who sat in the region and shadow of death light has dawned."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>Immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zeb'edee and John his brother, in the boat with Zeb'edee their father, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>Immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And he went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every infirmity among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, demoniacs, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decap'olis and Jerusalem and Judea and from beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>"Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>"Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>"Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>"Blessed are the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>"Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>"Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>"Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>"Blessed are you when men revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so men persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>"You are the salt of the earth; but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trodden under foot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>"You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do men light a lamp and put it under a bushel, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>"Think not that I have come to abolish the law and the prophets; I have come not to abolish them but to fulfil them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly, I say to you, till heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law until all is accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever then relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches men so, shall be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but he who does them and teaches them shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>"You have heard that it was said to the men of old, `You shall not kill; and whoever kills shall be liable to judgment.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you that every one who is angry with his brother shall be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother shall be liable to the council, and whoever says, `You fool!' shall be liable to the hell of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Make friends quickly with your accuser, while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>truly, I say to you, you will never get out till you have paid the last penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>"You have heard that it was said, `You shall not commit adultery.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>If your right eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away; it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>"It was also said, `Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you that every one who divorces his wife, except on the ground of unchastity, makes her an adulteress; and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>"Again you have heard that it was said to the men of old, `You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, Do not swear at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>And do not swear by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>Let what you say be simply `Yes' or `No'; anything more than this comes from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>"You have heard that it was said, `An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you, Do not resist one who is evil. But if any one strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>and if any one would sue you and take your coat, let him have your cloak as well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>and if any one forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him who begs from you, and do not refuse him who would borrow from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>"You have heard that it was said, `You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven; for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you salute only your brethren, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>You, therefore, must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>"Beware of practicing your piety before men in order to be seen by them; for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>"Thus, when you give alms, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you give alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>so that your alms may be in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>"And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites; for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>"And in praying do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do; for they think that they will be heard for their many words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Pray then like this: Our Father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us this day our daily bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>And forgive us our debts, As we also have forgiven our debtors;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father also will forgive you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>but if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>"And when you fast, do not look dismal, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by men. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>that your fasting may not be seen by men but by your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>"Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust consume and where thieves break in and steal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust consumes and where thieves do not break in and steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>"The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is sound, your whole body will be full of light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>but if your eye is not sound, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>"No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>"Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you shall eat or what you shall drink, nor about your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>And which of you by being anxious can add one cubit to his span of life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither toil nor spin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O men of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, `What shall we eat?' or `What shall we drink?' or `What shall we wear?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>"Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Let the day's own trouble be sufficient for the day.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.7'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.1'>"Judge not, that you be not judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.2'>For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and the measure you give will be the measure you get.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.4'>Or how can you say to your brother, `Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>"Do not give dogs what is holy; and do not throw your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under foot and turn to attack you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.7'>"Ask, and it will be given you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.8'>For every one who asks receives, and he who seeks finds, and to him who knocks it will be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.9'>Or what man of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.10'>Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>So whatever you wish that men would do to you, do so to them; for this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>"Enter by the narrow gate; for the gate is wide and the way is easy, that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.14'>For the gate is narrow and the way is hard, that leads to life, and those who find it are few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>"Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>You will know them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>So, every sound tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears evil fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>A sound tree cannot bear evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.19'>Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.20'>Thus you will know them by their fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.21'>"Not every one who says to me, `Lord, Lord,' shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.22'>On that day many will say to me, `Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.23'>And then will I declare to them, `I never knew you; depart from me, you evildoers.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.24'>"Every one then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house upon the rock;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.25'>and the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat upon that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.26'>And every one who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house upon the sand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.27'>and the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell; and great was the fall of it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.28'>And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.29'>for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>and behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, "Lord, if you will, you can make me clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And he stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, "I will; be clean." And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jesus said to him, "See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>As he entered Caper'na-um, a centurion came forward to him, beseeching him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>and saying, "Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, in terrible distress."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>And he said to him, "I will come and heal him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>But the centurion answered him, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof; but only say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I am a man under authority, with soldiers under me; and I say to one, `Go,' and he goes, and to another, `Come,' and he comes, and to my slave, `Do this,' and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jesus heard him, he marveled, and said to those who followed him, "Truly, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found such faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>I tell you, many will come from east and west and sit at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness; there men will weep and gnash their teeth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>And to the centurion Jesus said, "Go; be it done for you as you have believed." And the servant was healed at that very moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and served him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>That evening they brought to him many who were possessed with demons; and he cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>This was to fulfil what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah, "He took our infirmities and bore our diseases."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Now when Jesus saw great crowds around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>And a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>Another of the disciples said to him, "Lord, let me first go and bury my father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jesus said to him, "Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>And they went and woke him, saying, "Save, Lord; we are perishing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>And he said to them, "Why are you afraid, O men of little faith?" Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>And the men marveled, saying, "What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demoniacs met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>And behold, they cried out, "What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now a herd of many swine was feeding at some distance from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>And the demons begged him, "If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of swine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>And he said to them, "Go." So they came out and went into the swine; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and perished in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus; and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their neighborhood.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>And behold, they brought to him a paralytic, lying on his bed; and when Jesus saw their faith he said to the paralytic, "Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, "This man is blaspheming."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier, to say, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he then said to the paralytic--"Rise, take up your bed and go home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>And he rose and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax office; and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>And as he sat at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and sat down with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>But when he heard it, he said, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>Go and learn what this means, `I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>And no one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Neither is new wine put into old wineskins; if it is, the skins burst, and the wine is spilled, and the skins are destroyed; but new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While he was thus speaking to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, "My daughter has just died; but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And behold, a woman who had suffered from a hemorrhage for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>for she said to herself, "If I only touch his garment, I shall be made well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, "Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well." And instantly the woman was made well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And when Jesus came to the ruler's house, and saw the flute players, and the crowd making a tumult,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>he said, "Depart; for the girl is not dead but sleeping." And they laughed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>And the report of this went through all that district.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, "Have mercy on us, Son of David."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>When he entered the house, the blind men came to him; and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then he touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith be it done to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly charged them, "See that no one knows it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they went away and spread his fame through all that district.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>As they were going away, behold, a dumb demoniac was brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>And when the demon had been cast out, the dumb man spoke; and the crowds marveled, saying, "Never was anything like this seen in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, "He casts out demons by the prince of demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>pray therefore the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.2'>The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zeb'edee, and John his brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.3'>Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.4'>Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.5'>These twelve Jesus sent out, charging them, "Go nowhere among the Gentiles, and enter no town of the Samaritans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.6'>but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.7'>And preach as you go, saying, `The kingdom of heaven is at hand.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.10.10'>no bag for your journey, nor two tunics, nor sandals, nor a staff; for the laborer deserves his food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.11'>And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it, and stay with him until you depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.12'>As you enter the house, salute it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.13'>And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it; but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.14'>And if any one will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet as you leave that house or town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.15'>Truly, I say to you, it shall be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomor'rah than for that town.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.10.17'>Beware of men; for they will deliver you up to councils, and flog you in their synagogues,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.18'>and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear testimony before them and the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.19'>When they deliver you up, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say; for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.20'>for it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.10.24'>"A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.25'>it is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Be-el'zebul, how much more will they malign those of his household.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsem'ane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit here, while I go yonder and pray."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zeb'edee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, "My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping; and he said to Peter, "So, could you not watch with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, "My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, thy will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, "Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, "The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And he came up to Jesus at once and said, "Hail, Master!" And he kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus said to him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and struck the slave of the high priest, and cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place; for all who take the sword will perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>But how then should the scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has taken place, that the scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Ca'iaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests and the whole council sought false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, "This fellow said, `I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to build it in three days.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest stood up and said, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, "You have said so. But I tell you, hereafter you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his robes, and said, "He has uttered blasphemy. Why do we still need witnesses? You have now heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What is your judgment?" They answered, "He deserves death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in his face, and struck him; and some slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, "Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a maid came up to him, and said, "You also were with Jesus the Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you mean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied it with an oath, "I do not know the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, "Certainly you are also one of them, for your accent betrays you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know the man." And immediately the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, "Before the cock crows, you will deny me three times." And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>and they bound him and led him away and delivered him to Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>When Judas, his betrayer, saw that he was condemned, he repented and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, "I have sinned in betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And throwing down the pieces of silver in the temple, he departed; and he went and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since they are blood money."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>So they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus stood before the governor; and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he made no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge; so that the governor wondered greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they had then a notorious prisoner, called Barab'bas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you want me to release for you, Barab'bas or Jesus who is called Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much over him today in a dream."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the people to ask for Barab'bas and destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The governor again said to them, "Which of the two do you want me to release for you?" And they said, "Barab'bas."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, "Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?" They all said, "Let him be crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And he said, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Let him be crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered, "His blood be on us and on our children!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released for them Barab'bas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the praetorium, and they gathered the whole battalion before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And they spat upon him, and took the reed and struck him on the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe, and put his own clothes on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>As they went out, they came upon a man of Cyre'ne, Simon by name; this man they compelled to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And when they came to a place called Gol'gotha (which means the place of a skull),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they offered him wine to drink, mingled with gall; but when he tasted it, he would not drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>then they sat down and kept watch over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, "This is Jesus the King of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>"He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him; for he said, `I am the Son of God.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, la'ma sabach-tha'ni?" that is, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "This man is calling Eli'jah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the others said, "Wait, let us see whether Eli'jah will come to save him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus cried again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom; and the earth shook, and the rocks were split;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>the tombs also were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe, and said, "Truly this was the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>There were also many women there, looking on from afar, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom were Mary Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zeb'edee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathe'a, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Joseph took the body, and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn in the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the tomb, and departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Mary Mag'dalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>and said, "Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, `After three days I will rise again.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Therefore order the sepulchre to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away, and tell the people, `He has risen from the dead,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, "You have a guard of soldiers; go, make it as secure as you can."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and made the sepulchre secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Mag'dalene and the other Mary went to see the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, there was a great earthquake; for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone, and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His appearance was like lightning, and his raiment white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid; for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here; for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. Lo, I have told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And behold, Jesus met them and said, "Hail!" And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid; go and tell my brethren to go to Galilee, and there they will see me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sum of money to the soldiers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>and said, "Tell people, `His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the money and did as they were directed; and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him they worshiped him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, to the close of the age."</verse>
