If you remove your abominations from my presence, and do not waver,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>and if you swear, `As the LORD lives,' in truth, in justice, and in uprightness, then nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: "Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your doings."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet through the land; cry aloud and say, `Assemble, and let us go into the fortified cities!'</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Raise a standard toward Zion, flee for safety, stay not, for I bring evil from the north, and great destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>A lion has gone up from his thicket, a destroyer of nations has set out; he has gone forth from his place to make your land a waste; your cities will be ruins without inhabitant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>"In that day, says the LORD, courage shall fail both king and princes; the priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD, surely thou hast utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, `It shall be well with you'; whereas the sword has reached their very life."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Behold, he comes up like clouds, his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles-- woe to us, for we are ruined!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims evil from Mount E'phraim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Warn the nations that he is coming; announce to Jerusalem, "Besiegers come from a distant land; they shout against the cities of Judah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Like keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she has rebelled against me, says the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Your ways and your doings have brought this upon you. This is your doom, and it is bitter; it has reached your very heart."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh, the walls of my heart! My heart is beating wildly; I cannot keep silent; for I hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Disaster follows hard on disaster, the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my curtains in a moment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>How long must I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>"For my people are foolish, they know me not; they are stupid children, they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil, but how to do good they know not."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>I looked, and lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the air had fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>For thus says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be black; for I have spoken, I have purposed; I have not relented nor will I turn back."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>At the noise of horseman and archer every city takes to flight; they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; all the cities are forsaken, and no man dwells in them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And you, O desolate one, what do you mean that you dress in scarlet, that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>For I heard a cry as of a woman in travail, anguish as of one bringing forth her first child, the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands, "Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
