      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was in the beginning with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>all things were made through him, and without him was not anything made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came for testimony, to bear witness to the light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light, but came to bear witness to the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true light that enlightens every man was coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, yet the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own home, and his own people received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, full of grace and truth; we have beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>(John bore witness to him, and cried, "This was he of whom I said, `He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.'")</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And from his fulness have we all received, grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has ever seen God; the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He confessed, he did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?" He said, "I am not." "Are you the prophet?" And he answered, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said to him then, "Who are you? Let us have an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, "I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make straight the way of the Lord,' as the prophet Isaiah said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>They asked him, "Then why are you baptizing, if you are neither the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, "I baptize with water; but among you stands one whom you do not know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>even he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, `After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bore witness, "I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I myself did not know him; but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, `He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>The next day again John was standing with two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, "Behold, the Lamb of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, "What do you seek?" And they said to him, "Rabbi" (which means Teacher), "where are you staying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, "Come and see." They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found his brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him, and said, "So you are Simon the son of John? You shall be called Cephas" (which means Peter).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Beth-sa'ida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathan'a-el, and said to him, "We have found him of whom Moses in the law and also the prophets wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Nathan'a-el said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" Philip said to him, "Come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathan'a-el coming to him, and said of him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathan'a-el said to him, "How do you know me?" Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathan'a-el answered him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered him, "Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he said to him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>On the third day there was a marriage at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Jesus also was invited to the marriage, with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>When the wine failed, the mother of Jesus said to him, "They have no wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>And Jesus said to her, "O woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now six stone jars were standing there, for the Jewish rites of purification, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, "Fill the jars with water." And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>He said to them, "Now draw some out, and take it to the steward of the feast." So they took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the steward of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and did not know where it came from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the steward of the feast called the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, "Every man serves the good wine first; and when men have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Caper'na-um, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money-changers at their business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And making a whip of cords, he drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And he told those who sold the pigeons, "Take these things away; you shall not make my Father's house a house of trade."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for thy house will consume me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jews then said to him, "What sign have you to show us for doing this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered them, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews then said, "It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spoke of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>but Jesus did not trust himself to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>because he knew all men and needed no one to bear witness of man; for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicode'mus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do, unless God is with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered him, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicode'mus said to him, "How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not marvel that I said to you, `You must be born anew.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes; so it is with every one who is born of the Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicode'mus said to him, "How can this be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered him, "Are you a teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and bear witness to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how can you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>No one has ascended into heaven but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that whoever believes in him may have eternal life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes in him is not condemned; he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who does what is true comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea; there he remained with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John also was baptizing at Ae'non near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John had not yet been put in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Now a discussion arose between John's disciples and a Jew over purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John, and said to him, "Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you bore witness, here he is, baptizing, and all are going to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, "No one can receive anything except what is given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly at the bridegroom's voice; therefore this joy of mine is now full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks; he who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>He bears witness to what he has seen and heard, yet no one receives his testimony;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>he who receives his testimony sets his seal to this, that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God has sent utters the words of God, for it is not by measure that he gives the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>the Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God rests upon him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea and departed again to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>He had to pass through Samar'ia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>So he came to a city of Samar'ia, called Sy'char, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Jacob's well was there, and so Jesus, wearied as he was with his journey, sat down beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There came a woman of Samar'ia to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give me a drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The Samaritan woman said to him, "How is it that you, a Jew, ask a drink of me, a woman of Samar'ia?" For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, `Give me a drink,' you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to him, "Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep; where do you get that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus said to her, "Every one who drinks of this water will thirst again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst; the water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, "Go, call your husband, and come here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered him, "I have no husband." Jesus said to her, "You are right in saying, `I have no husband';</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands, and he whom you now have is not your husband; this you said truly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to him, "Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, "Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming (he who is called Christ); when he comes, he will show us all things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, "I who speak to you am he."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>Just then his disciples came. They marveled that he was talking with a woman, but none said, "What do you wish?" or, "Why are you talking with her?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>So the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>"Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Can this be the Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out of the city and were coming to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Meanwhile the disciples besought him, saying, "Rabbi, eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, "I have food to eat of which you do not know."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>So the disciples said to one another, "Has any one brought him food?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them, "My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, `There are yet four months, then comes the harvest'? I tell you, lift up your eyes, and see how the fields are already white for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>He who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For here the saying holds true, `One sows and another reaps.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Many Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, "He told me all that I ever did."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>They said to the woman, "It is no longer because of your words that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After the two days he departed to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Caper'na-um there was an official whose son was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus therefore said to him, "Unless you see signs and wonders you will not believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The official said to him, "Sir, come down before my child dies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, "Go; your son will live." The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he asked them the hour when he began to mend, and they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>The father knew that was the hour when Jesus had said to him, "Your son will live"; and he himself believed, and all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, in Hebrew called Beth-za'tha, which has five porticoes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a multitude of invalids, blind, lame, paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>One man was there, who had been ill for thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>When Jesus saw him and knew that he had been lying there a long time, he said to him, "Do you want to be healed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>The sick man answered him, "Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is troubled, and while I am going another steps down before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>Jesus said to him, "Rise, take up your pallet, and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>And at once the man was healed, and he took up his pallet and walked.  Now that day was the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>So the Jews said to the man who was cured, "It is the sabbath, it is not lawful for you to carry your pallet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>But he answered them, "The man who healed me said to me, `Take up your pallet, and walk.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>They asked him, "Who is the man who said to you, `Take up your pallet, and walk'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse befall you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>And this was why the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did this on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>But Jesus answered them, "My Father is working still, and I am working."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>This was why the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath but also called God his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, that the Son does likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself is doing; and greater works than these will he show him, that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>The Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; he does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>"Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>and come forth, those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>"I can do nothing on my own authority; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>If I bear witness to myself, my testimony is not true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>there is another who bears witness to me, and I know that the testimony which he bears to me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>You sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has granted me to accomplish, these very works which I am doing, bear me witness that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>And the Father who sent me has himself borne witness to me. His voice you have never heard, his form you have never seen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>and you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>You search the scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life; and it is they that bear witness to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>I do not receive glory from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>But I know that you have not the love of God within you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>How can you believe, who receive glory from one another and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiber'i-as.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a multitude followed him, because they saw the signs which he did on those who were diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>Jesus went up on the mountain, and there sat down with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Lifting up his eyes, then, and seeing that a multitude was coming to him, Jesus said to Philip, "How are we to buy bread, so that these people may eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>This he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each of them to get a little."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>"There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two fish; but what are they among so many?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, "Make the people sit down." Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, "Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves, left by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When the people saw the sign which he had done, they said, "This is indeed the prophet who is to come into the world!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Caper'na-um. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>When they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat. They were frightened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>but he said to them, "It is I; do not be afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>However, boats from Tiber'i-as came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they themselves got into the boats and went to Caper'na-um, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, "Rabbi, when did you come here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then they said to him, "What must we do, to be doing the works of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>So they said to him, "Then what sign do you do, that we may see, and believe you? What work do you perform?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, `He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jesus then said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is that which comes down from heaven, and gives life to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>They said to him, "Lord, give us this bread always."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life; he who comes to me shall not hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives me will come to me; and him who comes to me I will not cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>and this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews then murmured at him, because he said, "I am the bread which came down from heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>They said, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, `I have come down from heaven'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered them, "Do not murmur among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, `And they shall all be taught by God.' Every one who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any one has seen the Father except him who is from God; he has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread which came down from heaven; if any one eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews then disputed among themselves, saying, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>So Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of man and drink his blood, you have no life in you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>he who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who eats me will live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread which came down from heaven, not such as the fathers ate and died; he who eats this bread will live for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>This he said in the synagogue, as he taught at Caper'na-um.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, "This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, "Do you take offense at this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>Then what if you were to see the Son of man ascending where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the spirit that gives life, the flesh is of no avail; the words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you that do not believe." For Jesus knew from the first who those were that did not believe, and who it was that would betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And he said, "This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it is granted him by the Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>After this many of his disciples drew back and no longer went about with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Jesus said to the twelve, "Do you also wish to go away?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>and we have believed, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He spoke of Judas the son of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the twelve, was to betray him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>So his brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no man works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For even his brothers did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>Go to the feast yourselves; I am not going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>So saying, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly but in private.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, "Where is he?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much muttering about him among the people. While some said, "He is a good man," others said, "No, he is leading the people astray."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>Yet for fear of the Jews no one spoke openly of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>About the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>The Jews marveled at it, saying, "How is it that this man has learning, when he has never studied?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>So Jesus answered them, "My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>if any man's will is to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>He who speaks on his own authority seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of him who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The people answered, "You have a demon! Who is seeking to kill you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered them, "I did one deed, and you all marvel at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man upon the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If on the sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Some of the people of Jerusalem therefore said, "Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>And here he is, speaking openly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>Yet we know where this man comes from; and when the Christ appears, no one will know where he comes from."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>So Jesus proclaimed, as he taught in the temple, "You know me, and you know where I come from? But I have not come of my own accord; he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know him, for I come from him, and he sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>So they sought to arrest him; but no one laid hands on him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>Yet many of the people believed in him; they said, "When the Christ appears, will he do more signs than this man has done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd thus muttering about him, and the chief priests and Pharisees sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Jesus then said, "I shall be with you a little longer, and then I go to him who sent me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>you will seek me and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews said to one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What does he mean by saying, `You will seek me and you will not find me,' and, `Where I am you cannot come'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood up and proclaimed, "If any one thirst, let him come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes in me, as the scripture has said, `Out of his heart shall flow rivers of living water.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>Now this he said about the Spirit, which those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>When they heard these words, some of the people said, "This is really the prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others said, "This is the Christ." But some said, "Is the Christ to come from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Has not the scripture said that the Christ is descended from David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there was a division among the people over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>Some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, "Why did you not bring him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like this man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees answered them, "Are you led astray, you also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees believed in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this crowd, who do not know the law, are accursed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicode'mus, who had gone to him before, and who was one of them, said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>"Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he does?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They replied, "Are you from Galilee too? Search and you will see that no prophet is to rise from Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>They went each to his own house,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>The scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery, and placing her in the midst</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>they said to him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say about her?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>This they said to test him, that they might have some charge to bring against him. Jesus bent down and wrote with his finger on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>And as they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, "Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>But when they heard it, they went away, one by one, beginning with the eldest, and Jesus was left alone with the woman standing before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Jesus looked up and said to her, "Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She said, "No one, Lord." And Jesus said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and do not sin again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, "I am the light of the world; he who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees then said to him, "You are bearing witness to yourself; your testimony is not true."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered, "Even if I do bear witness to myself, my testimony is true, for I know whence I have come and whither I am going, but you do not know whence I come or whither I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge according to the flesh, I judge no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>Yet even if I do judge, my judgment is true, for it is not I alone that judge, but I and he who sent me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I bear witness to myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>They said to him therefore, "Where is your Father?" Jesus answered, "You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Again he said to them, "I go away, and you will seek me and die in your sin; where I am going, you cannot come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then said the Jews, "Will he kill himself, since he says, `Where I am going, you cannot come'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>He said to them, "You are from below, I am from above; you are of this world, I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>I told you that you would die in your sins, for you will die in your sins unless you believe that I am he."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>They said to him, "Who are you?" Jesus said to them, "Even what I have told you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak thus as the Father taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>As he spoke thus, many believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, "If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They answered him, "We are descendants of Abraham, and have never been in bondage to any one. How is it that you say, `You will be made free'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them, "Truly, truly, I say to you, every one who commits sin is a slave to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>The slave does not continue in the house for ever; the son continues for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you are descendants of Abraham; yet you seek to kill me, because my word finds no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered him, "Abraham is our father." Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would do what Abraham did,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God; this is not what Abraham did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You do what your father did." They said to him, "We were not born of fornication; we have one Father, even God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>You are of your father the devil, and your will is to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and has nothing to do with the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>But, because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason why you do not hear them is that you are not of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>The Jews answered him, "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered, "I have not a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Truly, truly, I say to you, if any one keeps my word, he will never see death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>The Jews said to him, "Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, `If any one keeps my word, he will never taste death.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you greater than our father Abraham, who died? And the prophets died! Who do you claim to be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, "If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; it is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I should be a liar like you; but I do know him and I keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham rejoiced that he was to see my day; he saw it and was glad."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>The Jews then said to him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>We must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day; night comes, when no one can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>As he said this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the spittle and anointed the man's eyes with the clay,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>saying to him, "Go, wash in the pool of Silo'am" (which means Sent). So he went and washed and came back seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, "Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some said, "It is he"; others said, "No, but he is like him." He said, "I am the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>They said to him, "Then how were your eyes opened?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered, "The man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, `Go to Silo'am and wash'; so I went and washed and received my sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>They said to him, "Where is he?" He said, "I do not know."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>Now it was a sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>The Pharisees again asked him how he had received his sight. And he said to them, "He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Some of the Pharisees said, "This man is not from God, for he does not keep the sabbath." But others said, "How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?" There was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>So they again said to the blind man, "What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?" He said, "He is a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>and asked them, "Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him; he is of age, he will speak for himself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>Therefore his parents said, "He is of age, ask him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, "Give God the praise; we know that this man is a sinner."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.42'>And many believed in him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was ill, Laz'arus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Laz'arus was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent to him, saying, "Lord, he whom you love is ill."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>But when Jesus heard it he said, "This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Laz'arus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>So when he heard that he was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this he said to the disciples, "Let us go into Judea again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any one walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if any one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>Thus he spoke, and then he said to them, "Our friend Laz'arus has fallen asleep, but I go to awake him out of sleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>The disciples said to him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus told them plainly, "Laz'arus is dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Thomas, called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, that we may die with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Now when Jesus came, he found that Laz'arus had already been in the tomb four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>And even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to him, "Yes, Lord; I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, he who is coming into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>When she had said this, she went and called her sister Mary, saying quietly, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>And when she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>When the Jews who were with her in the house, consoling her, saw Mary rise quickly and go out, they followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and he said, "Where have you laid him?" They said to him, "Lord, come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>So the Jews said, "See how he loved him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, "Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb; it was a cave, and a stone lay upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, "Take away the stone." Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, "Lord, by this time there will be an odor, for he has been dead four days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, "Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, "Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>I knew that thou hearest me always, but I have said this on account of the people standing by, that they may believe that thou didst send me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, "Laz'arus, come out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with bandages, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, "Unbind him, and let him go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many of the Jews therefore, who had come with Mary and had seen what he did, believed in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>So the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the council, and said, "What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him go on thus, every one will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our holy place and our nation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But one of them, Ca'iaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, "You know nothing at all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>you do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation should not perish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>He did not say this of his own accord, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called E'phraim; and there he stayed with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up from the country to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, "What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if any one knew where he was, he should let them know, so that they might arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Laz'arus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper; Martha served, and Laz'arus was one of those at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he who was to betray him), said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>"Why was this ointment not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was put into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus said, "Let her alone, let her keep it for the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>When the great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Laz'arus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>So the chief priests planned to put Laz'arus also to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day a great crowd who had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, "Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your king is coming, sitting on an ass's colt!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that this had been written of him and had been done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The crowd that had been with him when he called Laz'arus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>The reason why the crowd went to meet him was that they heard he had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees then said to one another, "You see that you can do nothing; look, the world has gone after him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were some Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>So these came to Philip, who was from Beth-sa'ida in Galilee, and said to him, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with Philip and they told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answered them, "The hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any one serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant be also; if any one serves me, the Father will honor him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>"Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? `Father, save me from this hour'? No, for this purpose I have come to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name." Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered, "This voice has come for your sake, not for mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this world be cast out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>and I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>He said this to show by what death he was to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The crowd answered him, "We have heard from the law that the Christ remains for ever. How can you say that the Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus said to them, "The light is with you for a little longer. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light."  When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>it was that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: "Lord, who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe. For Isaiah again said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they should see with their eyes and perceive with their heart, and turn for me to heal them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest they should be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>And Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who sees me sees him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come as light into the world, that whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>If any one hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken on my own authority; the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what to say and what to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandment is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father has bidden me."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart out of this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And during supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>rose from supper, laid aside his garments, and girded himself with a towel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>He came to Simon Peter; and Peter said to him, "Lord, do you wash my feet?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to him, "You shall never wash my feet." Jesus answered him, "If I do not wash you, you have no part in me."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, "He who has bathed does not need to wash, except for his feet, but he is clean all over; and you are clean, but not every one of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, "You are not all clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and resumed his place, he said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.18'>I am not speaking of you all; I know whom I have chosen; it is that the scripture may be fulfilled, `He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>When Jesus had thus spoken, he was troubled in spirit, and testified, "Truly, truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>One of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was lying close to the breast of Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>so Simon Peter beckoned to him and said, "Tell us who it is of whom he speaks."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>So lying thus, close to the breast of Jesus, he said to him, "Lord, who is it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, "It is he to whom I shall give this morsel when I have dipped it." So when he had dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>Then after the morsel, Satan entered into him. Jesus said to him, "What you are going to do, do quickly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>Now no one at the table knew why he said this to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>Some thought that, because Judas had the money box, Jesus was telling him, "Buy what we need for the feast"; or, that he should give something to the poor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his disciples across the Kidron valley, where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him, came forward and said to them, "Whom do you seek?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I am he." Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Again he asked them, "Whom do you seek?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he; so, if you seek me, let these men go."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, "Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, "My kingship is not of this world; if my kingship were of this world, my servants would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews; but my kingship is not from the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate said to him, "So you are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, "What is truth?"  After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, "I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover; will you have me release for you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>They cried out again, "Not this man, but Barab'bas!" Now Barab'bas was a robber.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate went out again, and said to them, "See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Behold the man!"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>he entered the praetorium again and said to Jesus, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate therefore said to him, "You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered him, "You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above; therefore he who delivered me to you has the greater sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>Upon this Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, "If you release this man, you are not Caesar's friend; every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat at a place called The Pavement, and in Hebrew, Gab'batha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>They cried out, "Away with him, away with him, crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?" The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then he handed him over to them to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>So they took Jesus, and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew Gol'gotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jesus between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read, "Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, "Do not write, `The King of the Jews,' but, `This man said, I am King of the Jews.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see whose it shall be." This was to fulfil the scripture, "They parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Mag'dalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother, "Woman, behold, your son!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, "Behold, your mother!" And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this Jesus, knowing that all was now finished, said (to fulfil the scripture), "I thirst."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>A bowl full of vinegar stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop and held it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, "It is finished"; and he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for that sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>He who saw it has borne witness--his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth--that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled, "Not a bone of him shall be broken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture says, "They shall look on him whom they have pierced."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After this Joseph of Arimathe'a, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him leave. So he came and took away his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicode'mus also, who had at first come to him by night, came bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds' weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Now on the first day of the week Mary Mag'dalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter then came out with the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths but rolled up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw and believed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>for as yet they did not know the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and one at the feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?" Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to him in Hebrew, "Rab-bo'ni!" (which means Teacher).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, "Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Mag'dalene went and said to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord"; and she told them that he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and place my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his side, I will not believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, "Peace be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands; and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be faithless, but believing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, "Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Now Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After this Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tibe'ri-as; and he revealed himself in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathan'a-el of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zeb'edee, and two others of his disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing." They said to him, "We will go with you." They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>Just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the beach; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus said to them, "Children, have you any fish?" They answered him, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some." So they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, for the quantity of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his clothes, for he was stripped for work, and sprang into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from the land, but about a hundred yards off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they got out on land, they saw a charcoal fire there, with fish lying on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, "Bring some of the fish that you have just caught."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>So Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish, a hundred and fifty-three of them; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, "Come and have breakfast." Now none of the disciples dared ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and so with the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said to him, "Feed my lambs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>A second time he said to him, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" He said to him, "Yes, Lord; you know that I love you." He said to him, "Tend my sheep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, "Do you love me?" And he said to him, "Lord, you know everything; you know that I love you." Jesus said to him, "Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you girded yourself and walked where you would; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>(This he said to show by what death he was to glorify God.) And after this he said to him, "Follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, who had lain close to his breast at the supper and had said, "Lord, who is it that is going to betray you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, "Lord, what about this man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, "If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you? Follow me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>The saying spread abroad among the brethren that this disciple was not to die; yet Jesus did not say to him that he was not to die, but, "If it is my will that he remain until I come, what is that to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who is bearing witness to these things, and who has written these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>But there are also many other things which Jesus did; were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</verse>
