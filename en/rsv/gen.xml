      <chapter osisID='Gen.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>The earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep; and the Spirit of God was moving over the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, "Let there be light"; and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw that the light was good; and God separated the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, "Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the firmament and separated the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God said, "Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear." And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>God called the dry land Earth, and the waters that were gathered together he called Seas. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, "Let the earth put forth vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind, upon the earth." And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>The earth brought forth vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their own kinds, and trees bearing fruit in which is their seed, each according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, "Let there be lights in the firmament of the heavens to separate the day from the night; and let them be for signs and for seasons and for days and years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>and let them be lights in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth." And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night; he made the stars also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the firmament of the heavens to give light upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, "Let the waters bring forth swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth across the firmament of the heavens."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>So God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarm, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said, "Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kinds: cattle and creeping things and beasts of the earth according to their kinds." And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kinds and the cattle according to their kinds, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the air, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>So God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them, and God said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, "Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree with seed in its fruit; you shall have them for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>And to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the air, and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food." And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw everything that he had made, and behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had done, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>So God blessed the seventh day and hallowed it, because on it God rested from all his work which he had done in creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created.  In the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>when no plant of the field was yet in the earth and no herb of the field had yet sprung up--for the LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was no man to till the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>but a mist went up from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>then the LORD God formed man of dust from the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And the LORD God planted a garden in Eden, in the east; and there he put the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground the LORD God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food, the tree of life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>A river flowed out of Eden to water the garden, and there it divided and became four rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first is Pishon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>and the gold of that land is good; bdellium and onyx stone are there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>The name of the second river is Gihon; it is the one which flows around the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river is Tigris, which flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>The LORD God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to till it and keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, "You may freely eat of every tree of the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it you shall die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>Then the LORD God said, "It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a helper fit for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>So out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called every living creature, that was its name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>The man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for the man there was not found a helper fit for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and while he slept took one of his ribs and closed up its place with flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>and the rib which the LORD God had taken from the man he made into a woman and brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>Then the man said,  "This at last is bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore a man leaves his father and his mother and cleaves to his wife, and they become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And the man and his wife were both naked, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more subtle than any other wild creature that the LORD God had made. He said to the woman, "Did God say, `You shall not eat of any tree of the garden'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said to the serpent, "We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>but God said, `You shall not eat of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, neither shall you touch it, lest you die.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>But the serpent said to the woman, "You will not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>For God knows that when you eat of it your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God, knowing good and evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make one wise, she took of its fruit and ate; and she also gave some to her husband, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>Then the eyes of both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day, and the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>But the LORD God called to the man, and said to him, "Where are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, "I heard the sound of thee in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>He said, "Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>The man said, "The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me fruit of the tree, and I ate."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>Then the LORD God said to the woman, "What is this that you have done?" The woman said, "The serpent beguiled me, and I ate."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, cursed are you above all cattle, and above all wild animals; upon your belly you shall go, and dust you shall eat all the days of your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>I will put enmity between you and the woman, and between your seed and her seed; he shall bruise your head, and you shall bruise his heel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman he said, "I will greatly multiply your pain in childbearing; in pain you shall bring forth children, yet your desire shall be for your husband, and he shall rule over you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to Adam he said, "Because you have listened to the voice of your wife, and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you, `You shall not eat of it,' cursed is the ground because of you; in toil you shall eat of it all the days of your life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to you; and you shall eat the plants of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of your face you shall eat bread till you return to the ground, for out of it you were taken; you are dust, and to dust you shall return."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>The man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And the LORD God made for Adam and for his wife garments of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>Then the LORD God said, "Behold, the man has become like one of us, knowing good and evil; and now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever"--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from which he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>He drove out the man; and at the east of the garden of Eden he placed the cherubim, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to guard the way to the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>Now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain, saying, "I have gotten a man with the help of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And again, she bore his brother Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, and Cain a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>In the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>and Abel brought of the firstlings of his flock and of their fat portions. And the LORD had regard for Abel and his offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>but for Cain and his offering he had no regard. So Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>The LORD said to Cain, "Why are you angry, and why has your countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If you do well, will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well, sin is couching at the door; its desire is for you, but you must master it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>Cain said to Abel his brother, "Let us go out to the field." And when they were in the field, Cain rose up against his brother Abel, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>Then the LORD said to Cain, "Where is Abel your brother?" He said, "I do not know; am I my brother's keeper?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And the LORD said, "What have you done? The voice of your brother's blood is crying to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother's blood from your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>When you till the ground, it shall no longer yield to you its strength; you shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>Cain said to the LORD, "My punishment is greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold, thou hast driven me this day away from the ground; and from thy face I shall be hidden; and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and whoever finds me will slay me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>Then the LORD said to him, "Not so! If any one slays Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold." And the LORD put a mark on Cain, lest any who came upon him should kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>Then Cain went away from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch; and he built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>To Enoch was born Irad; and Irad was the father of Me-hu'ja-el, and Me-hu'ja-el the father of Me-thu'sha-el, and Me-thu'sha-el the father of Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech took two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>Adah bore Jabal; he was the father of those who dwell in tents and have cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>His brother's name was Jubal; he was the father of all those who play the lyre and pipe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>Zillah bore Tubal-cain; he was the forger of all instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Na'amah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>Lamech said to his wives: "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; you wives of Lamech, hearken to what I say: I have slain a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain is avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy-sevenfold."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son and called his name Seth, for she said, "God has appointed for me another child instead of Abel, for Cain slew him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>To Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh. At that time men began to call upon the name of the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.1'>This is the book of the generations of Adam. When God created man, he made him in the likeness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.2'>Male and female he created them, and he blessed them and named them Man when they were created.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.3'>When Adam had lived a hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, after his image, and named him Seth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.4'>The days of Adam after he became the father of Seth were eight hundred years; and he had other sons and daughters.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.5.12'>When Kenan had lived seventy years, he became the father of Ma-hal'alel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.13'>Kenan lived after the birth of Ma-hal'alel eight hundred and forty years, and had other sons and daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.14'>Thus all the days of Kenan were nine hundred and ten years; and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.5.15'>When Ma-hal'alel had lived sixty-five years, he became the father of Jared.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.18.12'>So Sarah laughed to herself, saying, "After I have grown old, and my husband is old, shall I have pleasure?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.13'>The LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh, and say, `Shall I indeed bear a child, now that I am old?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.14'>Is anything too hard for the LORD? At the appointed time I will return to you, in the spring, and Sarah shall have a son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.15'>But Sarah denied, saying, "I did not laugh"; for she was afraid. He said, "No, but you did laugh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.16'>Then the men set out from there, and they looked toward Sodom; and Abraham went with them to set them on their way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.17'>The LORD said, "Shall I hide from Abraham what I am about to do,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.18'>seeing that Abraham shall become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth shall bless themselves by him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.19'>No, for I have chosen him, that he may charge his children and his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing righteousness and justice; so that the LORD may bring to Abraham what he has promised him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.20'>Then the LORD said, "Because the outcry against Sodom and Gomor'rah is great and their sin is very grave,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.21'>I will go down to see whether they have done altogether according to the outcry which has come to me; and if not, I will know."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.22'>So the men turned from there, and went toward Sodom; but Abraham still stood before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.23'>Then Abraham drew near, and said, "Wilt thou indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.24'>Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt thou then destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.25'>Far be it from thee to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.26'>And the LORD said, "If I find at Sodom fifty righteous in the city, I will spare the whole place for their sake."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.27'>Abraham answered, "Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord, I who am but dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.28'>Suppose five of the fifty righteous are lacking? Wilt thou destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And he said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.29'>Again he spoke to him, and said, "Suppose forty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of forty I will not do it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.30'>Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak. Suppose thirty are found there." He answered, "I will not do it, if I find thirty there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.31'>He said, "Behold, I have taken upon myself to speak to the Lord. Suppose twenty are found there." He answered, "For the sake of twenty I will not destroy it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.32'>Then he said, "Oh let not the Lord be angry, and I will speak again but this once. Suppose ten are found there." He answered, "For the sake of ten I will not destroy it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.18.33'>And the LORD went his way, when he had finished speaking to Abraham; and Abraham returned to his place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.19.3'>But he urged them strongly; so they turned aside to him and entered his house; and he made them a feast, and baked unleavened bread, and they ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.4'>But before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, all the people to the last man, surrounded the house;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.19.14'>So Lot went out and said to his sons-in-law, who were to marry his daughters, "Up, get out of this place; for the LORD is about to destroy the city." But he seemed to his sons-in-law to be jesting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.15'>When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot, saying, "Arise, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, lest you be consumed in the punishment of the city."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.19.17'>And when they had brought them forth, they said, "Flee for your life; do not look back or stop anywhere in the valley; flee to the hills, lest you be consumed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.18'>And Lot said to them, "Oh, no, my lords;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.19'>behold, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me great kindness in saving my life; but I cannot flee to the hills, lest the disaster overtake me, and I die.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.19.29'>So it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in which Lot dwelt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.19.30'>Now Lot went up out of Zo'ar, and dwelt in the hills with his two daughters, for he was afraid to dwell in Zo'ar; so he dwelt in a cave with his two daughters.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.23.8'>And he said to them, "If you are willing that I should bury my dead out of my sight, hear me, and entreat for me Ephron the son of Zohar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.9'>that he may give me the cave of Mach-pe'lah, which he owns; it is at the end of his field. For the full price let him give it to me in your presence as a possession for a burying place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.10'>Now Ephron was sitting among the Hittites; and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites, of all who went in at the gate of his city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.11'>"No, my lord, hear me; I give you the field, and I give you the cave that is in it; in the presence of the sons of my people I give it to you; bury your dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.12'>Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.13'>And he said to Ephron in the hearing of the people of the land, "But if you will, hear me; I will give the price of the field; accept it from me, that I may bury my dead there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.14'>Ephron answered Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.15'>"My lord, listen to me; a piece of land worth four hundred shekels of silver, what is that between you and me? Bury your dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.16'>Abraham agreed with Ephron; and Abraham weighed out for Ephron the silver which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites, four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.17'>So the field of Ephron in Mach-pe'lah, which was to the east of Mamre, the field with the cave which was in it and all the trees that were in the field, throughout its whole area, was made over</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.18'>to Abraham as a possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who went in at the gate of his city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.19'>After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Mach-pe'lah east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.23.20'>The field and the cave that is in it were made over to Abraham as a possession for a burying place by the Hittites.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.24.1'>Now Abraham was old, well advanced in years; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.24.2'>And Abraham said to his servant, the oldest of his house, who had charge of all that he had, "Put your hand under my thigh,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.24.10'>Then the servant took ten of his master's camels and departed, taking all sorts of choice gifts from his master; and he arose, and went to Mesopota'mia, to the city of Nahor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.24.11'>And he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of evening, the time when women go out to draw water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.24.12'>And he said, "O LORD, God of my master Abraham, grant me success today, I pray thee, and show steadfast love to my master Abraham.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.24.15'>Before he had done speaking, behold, Rebekah, who was born to Bethu'el the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, came out with her water jar upon her shoulder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.24.16'>The maiden was very fair to look upon, a virgin, whom no man had known. She went down to the spring, and filled her jar, and came up.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.24.22'>When the camels had done drinking, the man took a gold ring weighing a half shekel, and two bracelets for her arms weighing ten gold shekels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.24.23'>and said, "Tell me whose daughter you are. Is there room in your father's house for us to lodge in?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.26.31'>In the morning they rose early and took oath with one another; and Isaac set them on their way, and they departed from him in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.26.32'>That same day Isaac's servants came and told him about the well which they had dug, and said to him, "We have found water."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.26.33'>He called it Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beer-sheba to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.26.34'>When Esau was forty years old, he took to wife Judith the daughter of Be-e'ri the Hittite, and Bas'emath the daughter of Elon the Hittite;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.27'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.1'>When Isaac was old and his eyes were dim so that he could not see, he called Esau his older son, and said to him, "My son"; and he answered, "Here I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.2'>He said, "Behold, I am old; I do not know the day of my death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.3'>Now then, take your weapons, your quiver and your bow, and go out to the field, and hunt game for me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.4'>and prepare for me savory food, such as I love, and bring it to me that I may eat; that I may bless you before I die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.5'>Now Rebekah was listening when Isaac spoke to his son Esau. So when Esau went to the field to hunt for game and bring it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.6'>Rebekah said to her son Jacob, "I heard your father speak to your brother Esau,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.7'>`Bring me game, and prepare for me savory food, that I may eat it, and bless you before the LORD before I die.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.8'>Now therefore, my son, obey my word as I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.9'>Go to the flock, and fetch me two good kids, that I may prepare from them savory food for your father, such as he loves;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.27.11'>But Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, "Behold, my brother Esau is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.12'>Perhaps my father will feel me, and I shall seem to be mocking him, and bring a curse upon myself and not a blessing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.13'>His mother said to him, "Upon me be your curse, my son; only obey my word, and go, fetch them to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.14'>So he went and took them and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared savory food, such as his father loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.15'>Then Rebekah took the best garments of Esau her older son, which were with her in the house, and put them on Jacob her younger son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.16'>and the skins of the kids she put upon his hands and upon the smooth part of his neck;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.17'>and she gave the savory food and the bread, which she had prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.18'>So he went in to his father, and said, "My father"; and he said, "Here I am; who are you, my son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.19'>Jacob said to his father, "I am Esau your first-born. I have done as you told me; now sit up and eat of my game, that you may bless me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.20'>But Isaac said to his son, "How is it that you have found it so quickly, my son?" He answered, "Because the LORD your God granted me success."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.21'>Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come near, that I may feel you, my son, to know whether you are really my son Esau or not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.22'>So Jacob went near to Isaac his father, who felt him and said, "The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.23'>And he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau's hands; so he blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.24'>He said, "Are you really my son Esau?" He answered, "I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.25'>Then he said, "Bring it to me, that I may eat of my son's game and bless you." So he brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine, and he drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.26'>Then his father Isaac said to him, "Come near and kiss me, my son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.27'>So he came near and kissed him; and he smelled the smell of his garments, and blessed him, and said, "See, the smell of my son is as the smell of a field which the LORD has blessed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.28'>May God give you of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, and plenty of grain and wine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.27.30'>As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, when Jacob had scarcely gone out from the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.31'>He also prepared savory food, and brought it to his father. And he said to his father, "Let my father arise, and eat of his son's game, that you may bless me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.32'>His father Isaac said to him, "Who are you?" He answered, "I am your son, your first-born, Esau."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.33'>Then Isaac trembled violently, and said, "Who was it then that hunted game and brought it to me, and I ate it all before you came, and I have blessed him?--yes, and he shall be blessed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.34'>When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with an exceedingly great and bitter cry, and said to his father, "Bless me, even me also, O my father!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.35'>But he said, "Your brother came with guile, and he has taken away your blessing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.36'>Esau said, "Is he not rightly named Jacob? For he has supplanted me these two times. He took away my birthright; and behold, now he has taken away my blessing." Then he said, "Have you not reserved a blessing for me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.37'>Isaac answered Esau, "Behold, I have made him your lord, and all his brothers I have given to him for servants, and with grain and wine I have sustained him. What then can I do for you, my son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.38'>Esau said to his father, "Have you but one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father." And Esau lifted up his voice and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.39'>Then Isaac his father answered him: "Behold, away from the fatness of the earth shall your dwelling be, and away from the dew of heaven on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.40'>By your sword you shall live, and you shall serve your brother; but when you break loose you shall break his yoke from your neck."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.41'>Now Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father had blessed him, and Esau said to himself, "The days of mourning for my father are approaching; then I will kill my brother Jacob."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.42'>But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah; so she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said to him, "Behold, your brother Esau comforts himself by planning to kill you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.43'>Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee to Laban my brother in Haran,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.44'>and stay with him a while, until your brother's fury turns away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.45'>until your brother's anger turns away, and he forgets what you have done to him; then I will send, and fetch you from there. Why should I be bereft of you both in one day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.27.46'>Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I am weary of my life because of the Hittite women. If Jacob marries one of the Hittite women such as these, one of the women of the land, what good will my life be to me?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.28'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.1'>Then Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, and charged him, "You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.28.5'>Thus Isaac sent Jacob away; and he went to Paddan-aram to Laban, the son of Bethu'el the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, Jacob's and Esau's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.6'>Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him away to Paddan-aram to take a wife from there, and that as he blessed him he charged him, "You shall not marry one of the Canaanite women,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.7'>and that Jacob had obeyed his father and his mother and gone to Paddan-aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.8'>So when Esau saw that the Canaanite women did not please Isaac his father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.9'>Esau went to Ish'mael and took to wife, besides the wives he had, Ma'halath the daughter of Ish'mael Abraham's son, the sister of Neba'ioth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.10'>Jacob left Beer-sheba, and went toward Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.11'>And he came to a certain place, and stayed there that night, because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.12'>And he dreamed that there was a ladder set up on the earth, and the top of it reached to heaven; and behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.13'>And behold, the LORD stood above it and said, "I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your father and the God of Isaac; the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your descendants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.14'>and your descendants shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south; and by you and your descendants shall all the families of the earth bless themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.15'>Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go, and will bring you back to this land; for I will not leave you until I have done that of which I have spoken to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.16'>Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place; and I did not know it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.17'>And he was afraid, and said, "How awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.18'>So Jacob rose early in the morning, and he took the stone which he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.19'>He called the name of that place Bethel; but the name of the city was Luz at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.28.20'>Then Jacob made a vow, saying, "If God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.29'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.1'>Then Jacob went on his journey, and came to the land of the people of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.2'>As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and lo, three flocks of sheep lying beside it; for out of that well the flocks were watered. The stone on the well's mouth was large,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.3'>and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, and water the sheep, and put the stone back in its place upon the mouth of the well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.4'>Jacob said to them, "My brothers, where do you come from?" They said, "We are from Haran."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.5'>He said to them, "Do you know Laban the son of Nahor?" They said, "We know him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.6'>He said to them, "Is it well with him?" They said, "It is well; and see, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.7'>He said, "Behold, it is still high day, it is not time for the animals to be gathered together; water the sheep, and go, pasture them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.8'>But they said, "We cannot until all the flocks are gathered together, and the stone is rolled from the mouth of the well; then we water the sheep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.9'>While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father's sheep; for she kept them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.10'>Now when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother's brother, Jacob went up and rolled the stone from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his mother's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.11'>Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and wept aloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.12'>And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's kinsman, and that he was Rebekah's son; and she ran and told her father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.13'>When Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his sister's son, he ran to meet him, and embraced him and kissed him, and brought him to his house. Jacob told Laban all these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.14'>and Laban said to him, "Surely you are my bone and my flesh!" And he stayed with him a month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.15'>Then Laban said to Jacob, "Because you are my kinsman, should you therefore serve me for nothing? Tell me, what shall your wages be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.16'>Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.17'>Leah's eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful and lovely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.18'>Jacob loved Rachel; and he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter Rachel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.19'>Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than that I should give her to any other man; stay with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.20'>So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because of the love he had for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.21'>Then Jacob said to Laban, "Give me my wife that I may go in to her, for my time is completed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.22'>So Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made a feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.23'>But in the evening he took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob; and he went in to her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.29.25'>And in the morning, behold, it was Leah; and Jacob said to Laban, "What is this you have done to me? Did I not serve with you for Rachel? Why then have you deceived me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.26'>Laban said, "It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.27'>Complete the week of this one, and we will give you the other also in return for serving me another seven years."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.28'>Jacob did so, and completed her week; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.29'>(Laban gave his maid Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maid.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.30'>So Jacob went in to Rachel also, and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and served Laban for another seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.31'>When the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb; but Rachel was barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.32'>And Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben; for she said, "Because the LORD has looked upon my affliction; surely now my husband will love me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.33'>She conceived again and bore a son, and said, "Because the LORD has heard that I am hated, he has given me this son also"; and she called his name Simeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.34'>Again she conceived and bore a son, and said, "Now this time my husband will be joined to me, because I have borne him three sons"; therefore his name was called Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.29.35'>And she conceived again and bore a son, and said, "This time I will praise the LORD"; therefore she called his name Judah; then she ceased bearing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.30.38'>He set the rods which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the runnels, that is, the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink. And since they bred when they came to drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.39'>the flocks bred in front of the rods and so the flocks brought forth striped, speckled, and spotted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.40'>And Jacob separated the lambs, and set the faces of the flocks toward the striped and all the black in the flock of Laban; and he put his own droves apart, and did not put them with Laban's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.41'>Whenever the stronger of the flock were breeding Jacob laid the rods in the runnels before the eyes of the flock, that they might breed among the rods,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.42'>but for the feebler of the flock he did not lay them there; so the feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.30.43'>Thus the man grew exceedingly rich, and had large flocks, maidservants and menservants, and camels and asses.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.31'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.1'>Now Jacob heard that the sons of Laban were saying, "Jacob has taken all that was our father's; and from what was our father's he has gained all this wealth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.2'>And Jacob saw that Laban did not regard him with favor as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.3'>Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your fathers and to your kindred, and I will be with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.4'>So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.5'>and said to them, "I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before. But the God of my father has been with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.6'>You know that I have served your father with all my strength;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.7'>yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages ten times, but God did not permit him to harm me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.8'>If he said, `The spotted shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore spotted; and if he said, `The striped shall be your wages,' then all the flock bore striped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.9'>Thus God has taken away the cattle of your father, and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.10'>In the mating season of the flock I lifted up my eyes, and saw in a dream that the he-goats which leaped upon the flock were striped, spotted, and mottled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.11'>Then the angel of God said to me in the dream, `Jacob,' and I said, `Here I am!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.12'>And he said, `Lift up your eyes and see, all the goats that leap upon the flock are striped, spotted, and mottled; for I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.13'>I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now arise, go forth from this land, and return to the land of your birth.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.14'>Then Rachel and Leah answered him, "Is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our father's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.15'>Are we not regarded by him as foreigners? For he has sold us, and he has been using up the money given for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.16'>All the property which God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children; now then, whatever God has said to you, do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.17'>So Jacob arose, and set his sons and his wives on camels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.18'>and he drove away all his cattle, all his livestock which he had gained, the cattle in his possession which he had acquired in Paddan-aram, to go to the land of Canaan to his father Isaac.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.19'>Laban had gone to shear his sheep, and Rachel stole her father's household gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.20'>And Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, in that he did not tell him that he intended to flee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.21'>He fled with all that he had, and arose and crossed the Euphra'tes, and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.22'>When it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob had fled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.23'>he took his kinsmen with him and pursued him for seven days and followed close after him into the hill country of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.24'>But God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream by night, and said to him, "Take heed that you say not a word to Jacob, either good or bad."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.25'>And Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in the hill country, and Laban with his kinsmen encamped in the hill country of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.26'>And Laban said to Jacob, "What have you done, that you have cheated me, and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.27'>Why did you flee secretly, and cheat me, and did not tell me, so that I might have sent you away with mirth and songs, with tambourine and lyre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.28'>And why did you not permit me to kiss my sons and my daughters farewell? Now you have done foolishly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.29'>It is in my power to do you harm; but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, `Take heed that you speak to Jacob neither good nor bad.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.30'>And now you have gone away because you longed greatly for your father's house, but why did you steal my gods?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.31'>Jacob answered Laban, "Because I was afraid, for I thought that you would take your daughters from me by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.32'>Any one with whom you find your gods shall not live. In the presence of our kinsmen point out what I have that is yours, and take it." Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.33'>So Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and into the tent of the two maidservants, but he did not find them. And he went out of Leah's tent, and entered Rachel's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.34'>Now Rachel had taken the household gods and put them in the camel's saddle, and sat upon them. Laban felt all about the tent, but did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.35'>And she said to her father, "Let not my lord be angry that I cannot rise before you, for the way of women is upon me." So he searched, but did not find the household gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.36'>Then Jacob became angry, and upbraided Laban; Jacob said to Laban, "What is my offense? What is my sin, that you have hotly pursued me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.37'>Although you have felt through all my goods, what have you found of all your household goods? Set it here before my kinsmen and your kinsmen, that they may decide between us two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.38'>These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your she-goats have not miscarried, and I have not eaten the rams of your flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.39'>That which was torn by wild beasts I did not bring to you; I bore the loss of it myself; of my hand you required it, whether stolen by day or stolen by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.40'>Thus I was; by day the heat consumed me, and the cold by night, and my sleep fled from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.41'>These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock, and you have changed my wages ten times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.42'>If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been on my side, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God saw my affliction and the labor of my hands, and rebuked you last night."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.43'>Then Laban answered and said to Jacob, "The daughters are my daughters, the children are my children, the flocks are my flocks, and all that you see is mine. But what can I do this day to these my daughters, or to their children whom they have borne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.44'>Come now, let us make a covenant, you and I; and let it be a witness between you and me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.45'>So Jacob took a stone, and set it up as a pillar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.46'>And Jacob said to his kinsmen, "Gather stones," and they took stones, and made a heap; and they ate there by the heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.47'>Laban called it Je'gar-sahadu'tha: but Jacob called it Galeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.48'>Laban said, "This heap is a witness between you and me today." Therefore he named it Galeed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.49'>and the pillar Mizpah, for he said, "The LORD watch between you and me, when we are absent one from the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.50'>If you ill-treat my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, although no man is with us, remember, God is witness between you and me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.51'>Then Laban said to Jacob, "See this heap and the pillar, which I have set between you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.52'>This heap is a witness, and the pillar is a witness, that I will not pass over this heap to you, and you will not pass over this heap and this pillar to me, for harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.53'>The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, the God of their father, judge between us." So Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.54'>and Jacob offered a sacrifice on the mountain and called his kinsmen to eat bread; and they ate bread and tarried all night on the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.31.55'>Early in the morning Laban arose, and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them; then he departed and returned home.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.32'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.1'>Jacob went on his way and the angels of God met him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.2'>and when Jacob saw them he said, "This is God's army!" So he called the name of that place Mahana'im.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.3'>And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother in the land of Se'ir, the country of Edom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.4'>instructing them, "Thus you shall say to my lord Esau: Thus says your servant Jacob, `I have sojourned with Laban, and stayed until now;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.5'>and I have oxen, asses, flocks, menservants, and maidservants; and I have sent to tell my lord, in order that I may find favor in your sight.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.6'>And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, "We came to your brother Esau, and he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men with him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.7'>Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people that were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two companies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.8'>thinking, "If Esau comes to the one company and destroys it, then the company which is left will escape."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.9'>And Jacob said, "O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, O LORD who didst say to me, `Return to your country and to your kindred, and I will do you good,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.10'>I am not worthy of the least of all the steadfast love and all the faithfulness which thou hast shown to thy servant, for with only my staff I crossed this Jordan; and now I have become two companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.11'>Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, for I fear him, lest he come and slay us all, the mothers with the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.12'>But thou didst say, `I will do you good, and make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for multitude.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.13'>So he lodged there that night, and took from what he had with him a present for his brother Esau,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.14'>two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.15'>thirty milch camels and their colts, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty she-asses and ten he-asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.16'>These he delivered into the hand of his servants, every drove by itself, and said to his servants, "Pass on before me, and put a space between drove and drove."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.17'>He instructed the foremost, "When Esau my brother meets you, and asks you, `To whom do you belong? Where are you going? And whose are these before you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.18'>then you shall say, `They belong to your servant Jacob; they are a present sent to my lord Esau; and moreover he is behind us.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.19'>He likewise instructed the second and the third and all who followed the droves, "You shall say the same thing to Esau when you meet him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.20'>and you shall say, `Moreover your servant Jacob is behind us.'" For he thought, "I may appease him with the present that goes before me, and afterwards I shall see his face; perhaps he will accept me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.21'>So the present passed on before him; and he himself lodged that night in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.22'>The same night he arose and took his two wives, his two maids, and his eleven children, and crossed the ford of the Jabbok.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.23'>He took them and sent them across the stream, and likewise everything that he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.24'>And Jacob was left alone; and a man wrestled with him until the breaking of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.25'>When the man saw that he did not prevail against Jacob, he touched the hollow of his thigh; and Jacob's thigh was put out of joint as he wrestled with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.26'>Then he said, "Let me go, for the day is breaking." But Jacob said, "I will not let you go, unless you bless me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.27'>And he said to him, "What is your name?" And he said, "Jacob."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.28'>Then he said, "Your name shall no more be called Jacob, but Israel, for you have striven with God and with men, and have prevailed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.29'>Then Jacob asked him, "Tell me, I pray, your name." But he said, "Why is it that you ask my name?" And there he blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.30'>So Jacob called the name of the place Peni'el, saying, "For I have seen God face to face, and yet my life is preserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.31'>The sun rose upon him as he passed Penu'el, limping because of his thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.32.32'>Therefore to this day the Israelites do not eat the sinew of the hip which is upon the hollow of the thigh, because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh on the sinew of the hip.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.1'>And Jacob lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and four hundred men with him. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.33.10'>Jacob said, "No, I pray you, if I have found favor in your sight, then accept my present from my hand; for truly to see your face is like seeing the face of God, with such favor have you received me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.33.11'>Accept, I pray you, my gift that is brought to you, because God has dealt graciously with me, and because I have enough." Thus he urged him, and he took it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.35.1'>God said to Jacob, "Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there; and make there an altar to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.2'>So Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, "Put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves, and change your garments;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.3'>then let us arise and go up to Bethel, that I may make there an altar to the God who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.4'>So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that they had, and the rings that were in their ears; and Jacob hid them under the oak which was near Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.5'>And as they journeyed, a terror from God fell upon the cities that were round about them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.6'>And Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.7'>and there he built an altar, and called the place El-bethel, because there God had revealed himself to him when he fled from his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.8'>And Deb'orah, Rebekah's nurse, died, and she was buried under an oak below Bethel; so the name of it was called Al'lon-bacuth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.9'>God appeared to Jacob again, when he came from Paddan-aram, and blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.10'>And God said to him, "Your name is Jacob; no longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name." So his name was called Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.11'>And God said to him, "I am God Almighty: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall come from you, and kings shall spring from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.12'>The land which I gave to Abraham and Isaac I will give to you, and I will give the land to your descendants after you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.13'>Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.14'>And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him, a pillar of stone; and he poured out a drink offering on it, and poured oil on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.15'>So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.16'>Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when they were still some distance from Ephrath, Rachel travailed, and she had hard labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.17'>And when she was in her hard labor, the midwife said to her, "Fear not; for now you will have another son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.18'>And as her soul was departing (for she died), she called his name Ben-o'ni; but his father called his name Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.19'>So Rachel died, and she was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.20'>and Jacob set up a pillar upon her grave; it is the pillar of Rachel's tomb, which is there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.21'>Israel journeyed on, and pitched his tent beyond the tower of Eder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.22'>While Israel dwelt in that land Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine; and Israel heard of it.  Now the sons of Jacob were twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.23'>The sons of Leah: Reuben (Jacob's first-born), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Is'sachar, and Zeb'ulun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.24'>The sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.25'>The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's maid: Dan and Naph'tali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.26'>The sons of Zilpah, Leah's maid: Gad and Asher. These were the sons of Jacob who were born to him in Paddan-aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.27'>And Jacob came to his father Isaac at Mamre, or Kir'iath-ar'ba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had sojourned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.28'>Now the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.35.29'>And Isaac breathed his last; and he died and was gathered to his people, old and full of days; and his sons Esau and Jacob buried him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.36.1'>These are the descendants of Esau (that is, Edom).</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.36.6'>Then Esau took his wives, his sons, his daughters, and all the members of his household, his cattle, all his beasts, and all his property which he had acquired in the land of Canaan; and he went into a land away from his brother Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.7'>For their possessions were too great for them to dwell together; the land of their sojournings could not support them because of their cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.36.8'>So Esau dwelt in the hill country of Se'ir; Esau is Edom.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.37'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.1'>Jacob dwelt in the land of his father's sojournings, in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.2'>This is the history of the family of Jacob.  Joseph, being seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers; he was a lad with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father's wives; and Joseph brought an ill report of them to their father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.3'>Now Israel loved Joseph more than any other of his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a long robe with sleeves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.4'>But when his brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers, they hated him, and could not speak peaceably to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.5'>Now Joseph had a dream, and when he told it to his brothers they only hated him the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.6'>He said to them, "Hear this dream which I have dreamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.7'>behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and lo, my sheaf arose and stood upright; and behold, your sheaves gathered round it, and bowed down to my sheaf."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.8'>His brothers said to him, "Are you indeed to reign over us? Or are you indeed to have dominion over us?" So they hated him yet more for his dreams and for his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.9'>Then he dreamed another dream, and told it to his brothers, and said, "Behold, I have dreamed another dream; and behold, the sun, the moon, and eleven stars were bowing down to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.10'>But when he told it to his father and to his brothers, his father rebuked him, and said to him, "What is this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow ourselves to the ground before you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.11'>And his brothers were jealous of him, but his father kept the saying in mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.12'>Now his brothers went to pasture their father's flock near Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.13'>And Israel said to Joseph, "Are not your brothers pasturing the flock at Shechem? Come, I will send you to them." And he said to him, "Here I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.14'>So he said to him, "Go now, see if it is well with your brothers, and with the flock; and bring me word again." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he came to Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.15'>And a man found him wandering in the fields; and the man asked him, "What are you seeking?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.16'>"I am seeking my brothers," he said, "tell me, I pray you, where they are pasturing the flock."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.17'>And the man said, "They have gone away, for I heard them say, `Let us go to Dothan.'" So Joseph went after his brothers, and found them at Dothan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.18'>They saw him afar off, and before he came near to them they conspired against him to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.19'>They said to one another, "Here comes this dreamer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.20'>Come now, let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits; then we shall say that a wild beast has devoured him, and we shall see what will become of his dreams."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.21'>But when Reuben heard it, he delivered him out of their hands, saying, "Let us not take his life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.22'>And Reuben said to them, "Shed no blood; cast him into this pit here in the wilderness, but lay no hand upon him"--that he might rescue him out of their hand, to restore him to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.23'>So when Joseph came to his brothers, they stripped him of his robe, the long robe with sleeves that he wore;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.24'>and they took him and cast him into a pit. The pit was empty, there was no water in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.25'>Then they sat down to eat; and looking up they saw a caravan of Ish'maelites coming from Gilead, with their camels bearing gum, balm, and myrrh, on their way to carry it down to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.26'>Then Judah said to his brothers, "What profit is it if we slay our brother and conceal his blood?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.27'>Come, let us sell him to the Ish'maelites, and let not our hand be upon him, for he is our brother, our own flesh." And his brothers heeded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.28'>Then Mid'ianite traders passed by; and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and sold him to the Ish'maelites for twenty shekels of silver; and they took Joseph to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.29'>When Reuben returned to the pit and saw that Joseph was not in the pit, he rent his clothes</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.30'>and returned to his brothers, and said, "The lad is gone; and I, where shall I go?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.31'>Then they took Joseph's robe, and killed a goat, and dipped the robe in the blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.32'>and they sent the long robe with sleeves and brought it to their father, and said, "This we have found; see now whether it is your son's robe or not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.33'>And he recognized it, and said, "It is my son's robe; a wild beast has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn to pieces."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.34'>Then Jacob rent his garments, and put sackcloth upon his loins, and mourned for his son many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.35'>All his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him; but he refused to be comforted, and said, "No, I shall go down to Sheol to my son, mourning." Thus his father wept for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.37.36'>Meanwhile the Mid'ianites had sold him in Egypt to Pot'i-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.38'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.1'>It happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose name was Hirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.2'>There Judah saw the daughter of a certain Canaanite whose name was Shua; he married her and went in to her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.3'>and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.4'>Again she conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.5'>Yet again she bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. She was in Chezib when she bore him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.6'>And Judah took a wife for Er his first-born, and her name was Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.7'>But Er, Judah's first-born, was wicked in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.8'>Then Judah said to Onan, "Go in to your brother's wife, and perform the duty of a brother-in-law to her, and raise up offspring for your brother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.9'>But Onan knew that the offspring would not be his; so when he went in to his brother's wife he spilled the semen on the ground, lest he should give offspring to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.10'>And what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD, and he slew him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.11'>Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, "Remain a widow in your father's house, till Shelah my son grows up"--for he feared that he would die, like his brothers. So Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.12'>In course of time the wife of Judah, Shua's daughter, died; and when Judah was comforted, he went up to Timnah to his sheepshearers, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.13'>And when Tamar was told, "Your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.14'>she put off her widow's garments, and put on a veil, wrapping herself up, and sat at the entrance to Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah was grown up, and she had not been given to him in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.15'>When Judah saw her, he thought her to be a harlot, for she had covered her face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.16'>He went over to her at the road side, and said, "Come, let me come in to you," for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. She said, "What will you give me, that you may come in to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.17'>He answered, "I will send you a kid from the flock." And she said, "Will you give me a pledge, till you send it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.18'>He said, "What pledge shall I give you?" She replied, "Your signet and your cord, and your staff that is in your hand." So he gave them to her, and went in to her, and she conceived by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.19'>Then she arose and went away, and taking off her veil she put on the garments of her widowhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.20'>When Judah sent the kid by his friend the Adullamite, to receive the pledge from the woman's hand, he could not find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.21'>And he asked the men of the place, "Where is the harlot who was at Enaim by the wayside?" And they said, "No harlot has been here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.22'>So he returned to Judah, and said, "I have not found her; and also the men of the place said, `No harlot has been here.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.23'>And Judah replied, "Let her keep the things as her own, lest we be laughed at; you see, I sent this kid, and you could not find her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.24'>About three months later Judah was told, "Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the harlot; and moreover she is with child by harlotry." And Judah said, "Bring her out, and let her be burned."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.25'>As she was being brought out, she sent word to her father-in-law, "By the man to whom these belong, I am with child." And she said, "Mark, I pray you, whose these are, the signet and the cord and the staff."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.26'>Then Judah acknowledged them and said, "She is more righteous than I, inasmuch as I did not give her to my son Shelah." And he did not lie with her again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.27'>When the time of her delivery came, there were twins in her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.28'>And when she was in labor, one put out a hand; and the midwife took and bound on his hand a scarlet thread, saying, "This came out first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.29'>But as he drew back his hand, behold, his brother came out; and she said, "What a breach you have made for yourself!" Therefore his name was called Perez.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.38.30'>Afterward his brother came out with the scarlet thread upon his hand; and his name was called Zerah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.39'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.1'>Now Joseph was taken down to Egypt, and Pot'i-phar, an officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him from the Ish'maelites who had brought him down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.2'>The LORD was with Joseph, and he became a successful man; and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.3'>and his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the LORD caused all that he did to prosper in his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.4'>So Joseph found favor in his sight and attended him, and he made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.5'>From the time that he made him overseer in his house and over all that he had the LORD blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; the blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had, in house and field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.6'>So he left all that he had in Joseph's charge; and having him he had no concern for anything but the food which he ate.  Now Joseph was handsome and good-looking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.7'>And after a time his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph, and said, "Lie with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.8'>But he refused and said to his master's wife, "Lo, having me my master has no concern about anything in the house, and he has put everything that he has in my hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.9'>he is not greater in this house than I am; nor has he kept back anything from me except yourself, because you are his wife; how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.10'>And although she spoke to Joseph day after day, he would not listen to her, to lie with her or to be with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.11'>But one day, when he went into the house to do his work and none of the men of the house was there in the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.12'>she caught him by his garment, saying, "Lie with me." But he left his garment in her hand, and fled and got out of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.13'>And when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand, and had fled out of the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.14'>she called to the men of her household and said to them, "See, he has brought among us a Hebrew to insult us; he came in to me to lie with me, and I cried out with a loud voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.15'>and when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled and got out of the house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.16'>Then she laid up his garment by her until his master came home,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.17'>and she told him the same story, saying, "The Hebrew servant, whom you have brought among us, came in to me to insult me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.18'>but as soon as I lifted up my voice and cried, he left his garment with me, and fled out of the house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.19'>When his master heard the words which his wife spoke to him, "This is the way your servant treated me," his anger was kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.20'>And Joseph's master took him and put him into the prison, the place where the king's prisoners were confined, and he was there in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.21'>But the LORD was with Joseph and showed him steadfast love, and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.22'>And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's care all the prisoners who were in the prison; and whatever was done there, he was the doer of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.39.23'>the keeper of the prison paid no heed to anything that was in Joseph's care, because the LORD was with him; and whatever he did, the LORD made it prosper.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.40'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.1'>Some time after this, the butler of the king of Egypt and his baker offended their lord the king of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.2'>And Pharaoh was angry with his two officers, the chief butler and the chief baker,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.3'>and he put them in custody in the house of the captain of the guard, in the prison where Joseph was confined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.4'>The captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he waited on them; and they continued for some time in custody.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.5'>And one night they both dreamed--the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison--each his own dream, and each dream with its own meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.6'>When Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, they were troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.7'>So he asked Pharaoh's officers who were with him in custody in his master's house, "Why are your faces downcast today?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.8'>They said to him, "We have had dreams, and there is no one to interpret them." And Joseph said to them, "Do not interpretations belong to God? Tell them to me, I pray you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.9'>So the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, "In my dream there was a vine before me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.10'>and on the vine there were three branches; as soon as it budded, its blossoms shot forth, and the clusters ripened into grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.11'>Pharaoh's cup was in my hand; and I took the grapes and pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.12'>Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation: the three branches are three days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.13'>within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your office; and you shall place Pharaoh's cup in his hand as formerly, when you were his butler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.14'>But remember me, when it is well with you, and do me the kindness, I pray you, to make mention of me to Pharaoh, and so get me out of this house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.15'>For I was indeed stolen out of the land of the Hebrews; and here also I have done nothing that they should put me into the dungeon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.16'>When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was favorable, he said to Joseph, "I also had a dream: there were three cake baskets on my head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.17'>and in the uppermost basket there were all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds were eating it out of the basket on my head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.18'>And Joseph answered, "This is its interpretation: the three baskets are three days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.19'>within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head--from you!--and hang you on a tree; and the birds will eat the flesh from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.20'>On the third day, which was Pharaoh's birthday, he made a feast for all his servants, and lifted up the head of the chief butler and the head of the chief baker among his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.21'>He restored the chief butler to his butlership, and he placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.22'>but he hanged the chief baker, as Joseph had interpreted to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.40.23'>Yet the chief butler did not remember Joseph, but forgot him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.41'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.1'>After two whole years, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.2'>and behold, there came up out of the Nile seven cows sleek and fat, and they fed in the reed grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.3'>And behold, seven other cows, gaunt and thin, came up out of the Nile after them, and stood by the other cows on the bank of the Nile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.4'>And the gaunt and thin cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. And Pharaoh awoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.5'>And he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain, plump and good, were growing on one stalk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.6'>And behold, after them sprouted seven ears, thin and blighted by the east wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.7'>And the thin ears swallowed up the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and behold, it was a dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.8'>So in the morning his spirit was troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men; and Pharaoh told them his dream, but there was none who could interpret it to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.9'>Then the chief butler said to Pharaoh, "I remember my faults today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.10'>When Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and put me and the chief baker in custody in the house of the captain of the guard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.11'>we dreamed on the same night, he and I, each having a dream with its own meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.12'>A young Hebrew was there with us, a servant of the captain of the guard; and when we told him, he interpreted our dreams to us, giving an interpretation to each man according to his dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.13'>And as he interpreted to us, so it came to pass; I was restored to my office, and the baker was hanged."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.14'>Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon; and when he had shaved himself and changed his clothes, he came in before Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.15'>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I have had a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said of you that when you hear a dream you can interpret it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.16'>Joseph answered Pharaoh, "It is not in me; God will give Pharaoh a favorable answer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.17'>Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, in my dream I was standing on the banks of the Nile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.18'>and seven cows, fat and sleek, came up out of the Nile and fed in the reed grass;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.19'>and seven other cows came up after them, poor and very gaunt and thin, such as I had never seen in all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.20'>And the thin and gaunt cows ate up the first seven fat cows,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.21'>but when they had eaten them no one would have known that they had eaten them, for they were still as gaunt as at the beginning. Then I awoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.22'>I also saw in my dream seven ears growing on one stalk, full and good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.23'>and seven ears, withered, thin, and blighted by the east wind, sprouted after them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.24'>and the thin ears swallowed up the seven good ears. And I told it to the magicians, but there was no one who could explain it to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.25'>Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, "The dream of Pharaoh is one; God has revealed to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.26'>The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the dream is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.27'>The seven lean and gaunt cows that came up after them are seven years, and the seven empty ears blighted by the east wind are also seven years of famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.28'>It is as I told Pharaoh, God has shown to Pharaoh what he is about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.29'>There will come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.30'>but after them there will arise seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Egypt; the famine will consume the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.31'>and the plenty will be unknown in the land by reason of that famine which will follow, for it will be very grievous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.32'>And the doubling of Pharaoh's dream means that the thing is fixed by God, and God will shortly bring it to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.33'>Now therefore let Pharaoh select a man discreet and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.34'>Let Pharaoh proceed to appoint overseers over the land, and take the fifth part of the produce of the land of Egypt during the seven plenteous years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.35'>And let them gather all the food of these good years that are coming, and lay up grain under the authority of Pharaoh for food in the cities, and let them keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.36'>That food shall be a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine which are to befall the land of Egypt, so that the land may not perish through the famine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.37'>This proposal seemed good to Pharaoh and to all his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.38'>And Pharaoh said to his servants, "Can we find such a man as this, in whom is the Spirit of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.39'>So Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has shown you all this, there is none so discreet and wise as you are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.40'>you shall be over my house, and all my people shall order themselves as you command; only as regards the throne will I be greater than you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.41'>And Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Behold, I have set you over all the land of Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.42'>Then Pharaoh took his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in garments of fine linen, and put a gold chain about his neck;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.43'>and he made him to ride in his second chariot; and they cried before him, "Bow the knee!" Thus he set him over all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.44'>Moreover Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I am Pharaoh, and without your consent no man shall lift up hand or foot in all the land of Egypt."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.45'>And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaph'enath-pane'ah; and he gave him in marriage As'enath, the daughter of Poti'phera priest of On. So Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.46'>Joseph was thirty years old when he entered the service of Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh, and went through all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.47'>During the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth abundantly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.48'>and he gathered up all the food of the seven years when there was plenty in the land of Egypt, and stored up food in the cities; he stored up in every city the food from the fields around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.49'>And Joseph stored up grain in great abundance, like the sand of the sea, until he ceased to measure it, for it could not be measured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.50'>Before the year of famine came, Joseph had two sons, whom As'enath, the daughter of Poti'phera priest of On, bore to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.51'>Joseph called the name of the first-born Manas'seh, "For," he said, "God has made me forget all my hardship and all my father's house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.52'>The name of the second he called E'phraim, "For God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.53'>The seven years of plenty that prevailed in the land of Egypt came to an end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.54'>and the seven years of famine began to come, as Joseph had said. There was famine in all lands; but in all the land of Egypt there was bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.55'>When all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried to Pharaoh for bread; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, "Go to Joseph; what he says to you, do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.56'>So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.41.57'>Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the earth.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.42'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.1'>When Jacob learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why do you look at one another?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.42.3'>So ten of Joseph's brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.4'>But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph's brother, with his brothers, for he feared that harm might befall him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.5'>Thus the sons of Israel came to buy among the others who came, for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.6'>Now Joseph was governor over the land; he it was who sold to all the people of the land. And Joseph's brothers came, and bowed themselves before him with their faces to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.7'>Joseph saw his brothers, and knew them, but he treated them like strangers and spoke roughly to them. "Where do you come from?" he said. They said, "From the land of Canaan, to buy food."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.8'>Thus Joseph knew his brothers, but they did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.42.9'>And Joseph remembered the dreams which he had dreamed of them; and he said to them, "You are spies, you have come to see the weakness of the land."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.43.15'>So the men took the present, and they took double the money with them, and Benjamin; and they arose and went down to Egypt, and stood before Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.16'>When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, "Bring the men into the house, and slaughter an animal and make ready, for the men are to dine with me at noon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.17'>The man did as Joseph bade him, and brought the men to Joseph's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.18'>And the men were afraid because they were brought to Joseph's house, and they said, "It is because of the money, which was replaced in our sacks the first time, that we are brought in, so that he may seek occasion against us and fall upon us, to make slaves of us and seize our asses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.19'>So they went up to the steward of Joseph's house, and spoke with him at the door of the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.20'>and said, "Oh, my lord, we came down the first time to buy food;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.21'>and when we came to the lodging place we opened our sacks, and there was every man's money in the mouth of his sack, our money in full weight; so we have brought it again with us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.22'>and we have brought other money down in our hand to buy food. We do not know who put our money in our sacks."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.23'>He replied, "Rest assured, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father must have put treasure in your sacks for you; I received your money." Then he brought Simeon out to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.24'>And when the man had brought the men into Joseph's house, and given them water, and they had washed their feet, and when he had given their asses provender,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.25'>they made ready the present for Joseph's coming at noon, for they heard that they should eat bread there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.26'>When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present which they had with them, and bowed down to him to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.27'>And he inquired about their welfare, and said, "Is your father well, the old man of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.28'>They said, "Your servant our father is well, he is still alive." And they bowed their heads and made obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.29'>And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother's son, and said, "Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me? God be gracious to you, my son!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.30'>Then Joseph made haste, for his heart yearned for his brother, and he sought a place to weep. And he entered his chamber and wept there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.31'>Then he washed his face and came out; and controlling himself he said, "Let food be served."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.32'>They served him by himself, and them by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the Hebrews, for that is an abomination to the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.33'>And they sat before him, the first-born according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.43.34'>Portions were taken to them from Joseph's table, but Benjamin's portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they drank and were merry with him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.44'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.1'>Then he commanded the steward of his house, "Fill the men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put each man's money in the mouth of his sack,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.2'>and put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his money for the grain." And he did as Joseph told him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.3'>As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away with their asses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.44.6'>When he overtook them, he spoke to them these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.44.7'>They said to him, "Why does my lord speak such words as these? Far be it from your servants that they should do such a thing!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.47.26'>So Joseph made it a statute concerning the land of Egypt, and it stands to this day, that Pharaoh should have the fifth; the land of the priests alone did not become Pharaoh's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.27'>Thus Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen; and they gained possessions in it, and were fruitful and multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.28'>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred and forty-seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.29'>And when the time drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, "If now I have found favor in your sight, put your hand under my thigh, and promise to deal loyally and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.30'>but let me lie with my fathers; carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place." He answered, "I will do as you have said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.31'>And he said, "Swear to me"; and he swore to him. Then Israel bowed himself upon the head of his bed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.48'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.1'>After this Joseph was told, "Behold, your father is ill"; so he took with him his two sons, Manas'seh and E'phraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.2'>And it was told to Jacob, "Your son Joseph has come to you"; then Israel summoned his strength, and sat up in bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.3'>And Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.4'>and said to me, `Behold, I will make you fruitful, and multiply you, and I will make of you a company of peoples, and will give this land to your descendants after you for an everlasting possession.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.5'>And now your two sons, who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; E'phraim and Manas'seh shall be mine, as Reuben and Simeon are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.6'>And the offspring born to you after them shall be yours; they shall be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.7'>For when I came from Paddan, Rachel to my sorrow died in the land of Canaan on the way, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem)."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.8'>When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, "Who are these?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.9'>Joseph said to his father, "They are my sons, whom God has given me here." And he said, "Bring them to me, I pray you, that I may bless them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.10'>Now the eyes of Israel were dim with age, so that he could not see. So Joseph brought them near him; and he kissed them and embraced them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.11'>And Israel said to Joseph, "I had not thought to see your face; and lo, God has let me see your children also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.12'>Then Joseph removed them from his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.13'>And Joseph took them both, E'phraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manas'seh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.14'>And Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon the head of E'phraim, who was the younger, and his left hand upon the head of Manas'seh, crossing his hands, for Manas'seh was the first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.15'>And he blessed Joseph, and said, "The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has led me all my life long to this day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.16'>the angel who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and in them let my name be perpetuated, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.17'>When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of E'phraim, it displeased him; and he took his father's hand, to remove it from E'phraim's head to Manas'seh's head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.18'>And Joseph said to his father, "Not so, my father; for this one is the first-born; put your right hand upon his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.19'>But his father refused, and said, "I know, my son, I know; he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great; nevertheless his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.20'>So he blessed them that day, saying, "By you Israel will pronounce blessings, saying, `God make you as E'phraim and as Manas'seh'"; and thus he put E'phraim before Manas'seh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.21'>Then Israel said to Joseph, "Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and will bring you again to the land of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.22'>Moreover I have given to you rather than to your brothers one mountain slope which I took from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.49'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.1'>Then Jacob called his sons, and said, "Gather yourselves together, that I may tell you what shall befall you in days to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.2'>Assemble and hear, O sons of Jacob, and hearken to Israel your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.3'>Reuben, you are my first-born, my might, and the first fruits of my strength, pre-eminent in pride and pre-eminent in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.4'>Unstable as water, you shall not have pre-eminence because you went up to your father's bed; then you defiled it--you went up to my couch!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.5'>Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.6'>O my soul, come not into their council; O my spirit, be not joined to their company; for in their anger they slay men, and in their wantonness they hamstring oxen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.7'>Cursed be their anger, for it is fierce; and their wrath, for it is cruel! I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.8'>Judah, your brothers shall praise you; your hand shall be on the neck of your enemies; your father's sons shall bow down before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.9'>Judah is a lion's whelp; from the prey, my son, you have gone up. He stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as a lioness; who dares rouse him up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.10'>The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor the ruler's staff from between his feet, until he comes to whom it belongs; and to him shall be the obedience of the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.11'>Binding his foal to the vine and his ass's colt to the choice vine, he washes his garments in wine and his vesture in the blood of grapes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.12'>his eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with milk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.13'>Zeb'ulun shall dwell at the shore of the sea; he shall become a haven for ships, and his border shall be at Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.14'>Is'sachar is a strong ass, crouching between the sheepfolds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.15'>he saw that a resting place was good, and that the land was pleasant; so he bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a slave at forced labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.16'>Dan shall judge his people as one of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.17'>Dan shall be a serpent in the way, a viper by the path, that bites the horse's heels so that his rider falls backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.18'>I wait for thy salvation, O LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.19'>Raiders shall raid Gad, but he shall raid at their heels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.20'>Asher's food shall be rich, and he shall yield royal dainties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.21'>Naph'tali is a hind let loose, that bears comely fawns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.22'>Joseph is a fruitful bough, a fruitful bough by a spring; his branches run over the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.23'>The archers fiercely attacked him, shot at him, and harassed him sorely;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.24'>yet his bow remained unmoved, his arms were made agile by the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob (by the name of the Shepherd, the Rock of Israel),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.25'>by the God of your father who will help you, by God Almighty who will bless you with blessings of heaven above, blessings of the deep that couches beneath, blessings of the breasts and of the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.26'>The blessings of your father are mighty beyond the blessings of the eternal mountains, the bounties of the everlasting hills; may they be on the head of Joseph, and on the brow of him who was separate from his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.27'>Benjamin is a ravenous wolf, in the morning devouring the prey, and at even dividing the spoil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.28'>All these are the twelve tribes of Israel; and this is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each with the blessing suitable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.29'>Then he charged them, and said to them, "I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.30'>in the cave that is in the field at Mach-pe'lah, to the east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite to possess as a burying place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.31'>There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.32'>the field and the cave that is in it were purchased from the Hittites."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.49.33'>When Jacob finished charging his sons, he drew up his feet into the bed, and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.50'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.1'>Then Joseph fell on his father's face, and wept over him, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.2'>And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.3'>forty days were required for it, for so many are required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept for him seventy days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.4'>And when the days of weeping for him were past, Joseph spoke to the household of Pharaoh, saying, "If now I have found favor in your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.5'>My father made me swear, saying, `I am about to die: in my tomb which I hewed out for myself in the land of Canaan, there shall you bury me.' Now therefore let me go up, I pray you, and bury my father; then I will return."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.6'>And Pharaoh answered, "Go up, and bury your father, as he made you swear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.7'>So Joseph went up to bury his father; and with him went up all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his household, and all the elders of the land of Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.8'>as well as all the household of Joseph, his brothers, and his father's household; only their children, their flocks, and their herds were left in the land of Goshen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.9'>And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen; it was a very great company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.10'>When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they lamented there with a very great and sorrowful lamentation; and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.11'>When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning on the threshing floor of Atad, they said, "This is a grievous mourning to the Egyptians." Therefore the place was named A'bel-mizraim; it is beyond the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.12'>Thus his sons did for him as he had commanded them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.13'>for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan, and buried him in the cave of the field at Mach-pe'lah, to the east of Mamre, which Abraham bought with the field from Ephron the Hittite, to possess as a burying place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.14'>After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had gone up with him to bury his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.15'>When Joseph's brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, "It may be that Joseph will hate us and pay us back for all the evil which we did to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.16'>So they sent a message to Joseph, saying, "Your father gave this command before he died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.17'>`Say to Joseph, Forgive, I pray you, the transgression of your brothers and their sin, because they did evil to you.' And now, we pray you, forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father." Joseph wept when they spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.18'>His brothers also came and fell down before him, and said, "Behold, we are your servants."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.19'>But Joseph said to them, "Fear not, for am I in the place of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.20'>As for you, you meant evil against me; but God meant it for good, to bring it about that many people should be kept alive, as they are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.21'>So do not fear; I will provide for you and your little ones." Thus he reassured them and comforted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.22'>So Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he and his father's house; and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.23'>And Joseph saw E'phraim's children of the third generation; the children also of Machir the son of Manas'seh were born upon Joseph's knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.24'>And Joseph said to his brothers, "I am about to die; but God will visit you, and bring you up out of this land to the land which he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.25'>Then Joseph took an oath of the sons of Israel, saying, "God will visit you, and you shall carry up my bones from here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.50.26'>So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</verse>
