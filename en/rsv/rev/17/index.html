When I saw her I marveled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>But the angel said to me, "Why marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is to ascend from the bottomless pit and go to perdition; and the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world, will marvel to behold the beast, because it was and is not and is to come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain only a little while.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to perdition.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>These are of one mind and give over their power and authority to the beast;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>they will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he said to me, "The waters that you saw, where the harlot is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the harlot; they will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and giving over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God shall be fulfilled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the woman that you saw is the great city which has dominion over the kings of the earth."</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
