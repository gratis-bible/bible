      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <title>And behold the divisions of the priests and the Levites for all the service of the house of God; and with you in all the work will be every willing man who has skill for any kind of service; also the officers and all the people will be wholly at your command."</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>Solomon the son of David established himself in his kingdom, and the LORD his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>Solomon spoke to all Israel, to the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, to the judges, and to all the leaders in all Israel, the heads of fathers' houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>And Solomon, and all the assembly with him, went to the high place that was at Gibeon; for the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD had made in the wilderness, was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>(But David had brought up the ark of God from Kir'iath-je'arim to the place that David had prepared for it, for he had pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>Moreover the bronze altar that Bez'alel the son of Uri, son of Hur, had made, was there before the tabernacle of the LORD. And Solomon and the assembly sought the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before the LORD, which was at the tent of meeting, and offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>In that night God appeared to Solomon, and said to him, "Ask what I shall give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said to God, "Thou hast shown great and steadfast love to David my father, and hast made me king in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>O LORD God, let thy promise to David my father be now fulfilled, for thou hast made me king over a people as many as the dust of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Give me now wisdom and knowledge to go out and come in before this people, for who can rule this thy people, that is so great?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>God answered Solomon, "Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked possessions, wealth, honor, or the life of those who hate you, and have not even asked long life, but have asked wisdom and knowledge for yourself that you may rule my people over whom I have made you king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>wisdom and knowledge are granted to you. I will also give you riches, possessions, and honor, such as none of the kings had who were before you, and none after you shall have the like."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>So Solomon came from the high place at Gibeon, from before the tent of meeting, to Jerusalem. And he reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen; he had fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephe'lah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And Solomon's import of horses was from Egypt and Ku'e, and the king's traders received them from Ku'e for a price.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>They imported a chariot from Egypt for six hundred shekels of silver, and a horse for a hundred and fifty; likewise through them these were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>Now Solomon purposed to build a temple for the name of the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And Solomon assigned seventy thousand men to bear burdens and eighty thousand to quarry in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred to oversee them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Solomon sent word to Huram the king of Tyre: "As you dealt with David my father and sent him cedar to build himself a house to dwell in, so deal with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>Behold, I am about to build a house for the name of the LORD my God and dedicate it to him for the burning of incense of sweet spices before him, and for the continual offering of the showbread, and for burnt offerings morning and evening, on the sabbaths and the new moons and the appointed feasts of the LORD our God, as ordained for ever for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>The house which I am to build will be great, for our God is greater than all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>But who is able to build him a house, since heaven, even highest heaven, cannot contain him? Who am I to build a house for him, except as a place to burn incense before him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>So now send me a man skilled to work in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and in purple, crimson, and blue fabrics, trained also in engraving, to be with the skilled workers who are with me in Judah and Jerusalem, whom David my father provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>Send me also cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, for I know that your servants know how to cut timber in Lebanon. And my servants will be with your servants,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>to prepare timber for me in abundance, for the house I am to build will be great and wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>I will give for your servants, the hewers who cut timber, twenty thousand cors of crushed wheat, twenty thousand cors of barley, twenty thousand baths of wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in a letter which he sent to Solomon, "Because the LORD loves his people he has made you king over them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>Huram also said, "Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who made heaven and earth, who has given King David a wise son, endued with discretion and understanding, who will build a temple for the LORD, and a royal palace for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>"Now I have sent a skilled man, endued with understanding, Huram-abi,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>the son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was a man of Tyre. He is trained to work in gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and wood, and in purple, blue, and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and to do all sorts of engraving and execute any design that may be assigned him, with your craftsmen, the craftsmen of my lord, David your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>Now therefore the wheat and barley, oil and wine, of which my lord has spoken, let him send to his servants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>and we will cut whatever timber you need from Lebanon, and bring it to you in rafts by sea to Joppa, so that you may take it up to Jerusalem."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>Then Solomon took a census of all the aliens who were in the land of Israel, after the census of them which David his father had taken; and there were found a hundred and fifty-three thousand six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>Seventy thousand of them he assigned to bear burdens, eighty thousand to quarry in the hill country, and three thousand six hundred as overseers to make the people work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Mori'ah, where the LORD had appeared to David his father, at the place that David had appointed, on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jeb'usite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>He began to build in the second month of the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>These are Solomon's measurements for building the house of God: the length, in cubits of the old standard, was sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house; and its height was a hundred and twenty cubits. He overlaid it on the inside with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>The nave he lined with cypress, and covered it with fine gold, and made palms and chains on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>He adorned the house with settings of precious stones. The gold was gold of Parva'im.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>So he lined the house with gold--its beams, its thresholds, its walls, and its doors; and he carved cherubim on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the most holy place; its length, corresponding to the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and its breadth was twenty cubits; he overlaid it with six hundred talents of fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>The weight of the nails was one shekel to fifty shekels of gold. And he overlaid the upper chambers with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>In the most holy place he made two cherubim of wood and overlaid them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>The wings of the cherubim together extended twenty cubits: one wing of the one, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and its other wing, of five cubits, touched the wing of the other cherub;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>and of this cherub, one wing, of five cubits, touched the wall of the house, and the other wing, also of five cubits, was joined to the wing of the first cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>The wings of these cherubim extended twenty cubits; the cherubim stood on their feet, facing the nave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made the veil of blue and purple and crimson fabrics and fine linen, and worked cherubim on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>In front of the house he made two pillars thirty-five cubits high, with a capital of five cubits on the top of each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>He made chains like a necklace and put them on the tops of the pillars; and he made a hundred pomegranates, and put them on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>He set up the pillars in front of the temple, one on the south, the other on the north; that on the south he called Jachin, and that on the north Bo'az.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>He made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits long, and twenty cubits wide, and ten cubits high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>Then he made the molten sea; it was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>Under it were figures of gourds, for thirty cubits, compassing the sea round about; the gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It stood upon twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east; the sea was set upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>Its thickness was a handbreadth; and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily; it held over three thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>He also made ten lavers in which to wash, and set five on the south side, and five on the north side. In these they were to rinse off what was used for the burnt offering, and the sea was for the priests to wash in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made ten golden lampstands as prescribed, and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>He also made ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north. And he made a hundred basins of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>He made the court of the priests, and the great court, and doors for the court, and overlaid their doors with bronze;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>and he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>Huram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Huram finished the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>the two pillars, the bowls, and the two capitals on the top of the pillars; and the two networks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the top of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>and the four hundred pomegranates for the two networks, two rows of pomegranates for each network, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were upon the pillars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>He made the stands also, and the lavers upon the stands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>The pots, the shovels, the forks, and all the equipment for these Huram-abi made of burnished bronze for King Solomon for the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zer'edah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>Solomon made all these things in great quantities, so that the weight of the bronze was not ascertained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>So Solomon made all the things that were in the house of God: the golden altar, the tables for the bread of the Presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>the lampstands and their lamps of pure gold to burn before the inner sanctuary, as prescribed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of purest gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>the snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and firepans, of pure gold; and the sockets of the temple, for the inner doors to the most holy place and for the doors of the nave of the temple were of gold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>Thus all the work that Solomon did for the house of the LORD was finished. And Solomon brought in the things which David his father had dedicated, and stored the silver, the gold, and all the vessels in the treasuries of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers' houses of the people of Israel, in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>And all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the feast which is in the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites took up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>And they brought up the ark, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>So the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the LORD to its place, in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the most holy place, underneath the wings of the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering above the ark and its poles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the holy place before the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside; and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>There was nothing in the ark except the two tables which Moses put there at Horeb, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>Now when the priests came out of the holy place (for all the priests who were present had sanctified themselves, without regard to their divisions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>and all the Levitical singers, Asaph, Heman, and Jedu'thun, their sons and kinsmen, arrayed in fine linen, with cymbals, harps, and lyres, stood east of the altar with a hundred and twenty priests who were trumpeters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>and it was the duty of the trumpeters and singers to make themselves heard in unison in praise and thanksgiving to the LORD), and when the song was raised, with trumpets and cymbals and other musical instruments, in praise to the LORD, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures for ever," the house, the house of the LORD, was filled with a cloud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud; for the glory of the LORD filled the house of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then Solomon said, "The LORD has said that he would dwell in thick darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>I have built thee an exalted house, a place for thee to dwell in for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>Then the king faced about, and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>And he said, "Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>`Since the day that I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I chose no city in all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there, and I chose no man as prince over my people Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>but I have chosen Jerusalem that my name may be there and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>But the LORD said to David my father, `Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>nevertheless you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>Now the LORD has fulfilled his promise which he made; for I have risen in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and I have built the house for the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>And there I have set the ark, in which is the covenant of the LORD which he made with the people of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>Solomon had made a bronze platform five cubits long, five cubits wide, and three cubits high, and had set it in the court; and he stood upon it. Then he knelt upon his knees in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>and said, "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like thee, in heaven or on earth, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to thy servants who walk before thee with all their heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>who hast kept with thy servant David my father what thou didst declare to him; yea, thou didst speak with thy mouth, and with thy hand hast fulfilled it this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, keep with thy servant David my father what thou hast promised him, saying, `There shall never fail you a man before me to sit upon the throne of Israel, if only your sons take heed to their way, to walk in my law as you have walked before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>Now therefore, O LORD, God of Israel, let thy word be confirmed, which thou hast spoken to thy servant David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>"But will God dwell indeed with man on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain thee; how much less this house which I have built!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>Yet have regard to the prayer of thy servant and to his supplication, O LORD my God, hearkening to the cry and to the prayer which thy servant prays before thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>that thy eyes may be open day and night toward this house, the place where thou hast promised to set thy name, that thou mayest hearken to the prayer which thy servant offers toward this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>And hearken thou to the supplications of thy servant and of thy people Israel, when they pray toward this place; yea, hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place; and when thou hearest, forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.22'>"If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath, and comes and swears his oath before thy altar in this house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.23'>then hear thou from heaven, and act, and judge thy servants, requiting the guilty by bringing his conduct upon his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.24'>"If thy people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against thee, when they turn again and acknowledge thy name, and pray and make supplication to thee in this house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.25'>then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy people Israel, and bring them again to the land which thou gavest to them and to their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.26'>"When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against thee, if they pray toward this place, and acknowledge thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost afflict them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.17'>The king also made a great ivory throne, and overlaid it with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.18'>The throne had six steps and a footstool of gold, which were attached to the throne, and on each side of the seat were arm rests and two lions standing beside the arm rests,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.20'>All King Solomon's drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.21'>For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of Huram; once every three years the ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.7'>When the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word of the LORD came to Shemai'ah: "They have humbled themselves; I will not destroy them, but I will grant them some deliverance, and my wrath shall not be poured out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.8'>Nevertheless they shall be servants to him, that they may know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the countries."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.9'>So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem; he took away the treasures of the house of the LORD and the treasures of the king's house; he took away everything. He also took away the shields of gold which Solomon had made;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.10'>and King Rehobo'am made in their stead shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.11'>And as often as the king went into the house of the LORD, the guard came and bore them, and brought them back to the guardroom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.12'>And when he humbled himself the wrath of the LORD turned from him, so as not to make a complete destruction; moreover, conditions were good in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.13'>So King Rehobo'am established himself in Jerusalem and reigned. Rehobo'am was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel to put his name there. His mother's name was Na'amah the Ammonitess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.14'>And he did evil, for he did not set his heart to seek the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.15'>Now the acts of Rehobo'am, from first to last, are they not written in the chronicles of Shemai'ah the prophet and of Iddo the seer? There were continual wars between Rehobo'am and Jerobo'am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.12'>Behold, God is with us at our head, and his priests with their battle trumpets to sound the call to battle against you. O sons of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your fathers; for you cannot succeed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.13'>Jerobo'am had sent an ambush around to come on them from behind; thus his troops were in front of Judah, and the ambush was behind them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.14'>And when Judah looked, behold, the battle was before and behind them; and they cried to the LORD, and the priests blew the trumpets.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>And Asa had an army of three hundred thousand from Judah, armed with bucklers and spears, and two hundred and eighty thousand men from Benjamin, that carried shields and drew bows; all these were mighty men of valor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.5'>So they decreed to make a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beer-sheba to Dan, that the people should come and keep the passover to the LORD the God of Israel, at Jerusalem; for they had not kept it in great numbers as prescribed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.6'>So couriers went throughout all Israel and Judah with letters from the king and his princes, as the king had commanded, saying, "O people of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, that he may turn again to the remnant of you who have escaped from the hand of the kings of Assyria.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.17'>For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had to kill the passover lamb for every one who was not clean, to make it holy to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.18'>For a multitude of the people, many of them from E'phraim, Manas'seh, Is'sachar, and Zeb'ulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezeki'ah had prayed for them, saying, "The good LORD pardon every one</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.19'>who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD the God of his fathers, even though not according to the sanctuary's rules of cleanness."</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.22'>He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, as Manas'seh his father had done. Amon sacrificed to all the images that Manas'seh his father had made, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.23'>And he did not humble himself before the LORD, as Manas'seh his father had humbled himself, but this Amon incurred guilt more and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.24'>And his servants conspired against him and killed him in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.25'>But the people of the land slew all those who had conspired against King Amon; and the people of the land made Josi'ah his son king in his stead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.1'>Josi'ah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned thirty-one years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.2'>He did what was right in the eyes of the LORD, and walked in the ways of David his father; and he did not turn aside to the right or to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.3'>For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet a boy, he began to seek the God of David his father; and in the twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places, the Ashe'rim, and the graven and the molten images.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.4'>And they broke down the altars of the Ba'als in his presence; and he hewed down the incense altars which stood above them; and he broke in pieces the Ashe'rim and the graven and the molten images, and he made dust of them and strewed it over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.5'>He also burned the bones of the priests on their altars, and purged Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.6'>And in the cities of Manas'seh, E'phraim, and Simeon, and as far as Naph'tali, in their ruins round about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.7'>he broke down the altars, and beat the Ashe'rim and the images into powder, and hewed down all the incense altars throughout all the land of Israel. Then he returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.8'>Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azali'ah, and Ma-asei'ah the governor of the city, and Jo'ah the son of Jo'ahaz, the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.9'>They came to Hilki'ah the high priest and delivered the money that had been brought into the house of God, which the Levites, the keepers of the threshold, had collected from Manas'seh and E'phraim and from all the remnant of Israel and from all Judah and Benjamin and from the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.10'>They delivered it to the workmen who had the oversight of the house of the LORD; and the workmen who were working in the house of the LORD gave it for repairing and restoring the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.11'>They gave it to the carpenters and the builders to buy quarried stone, and timber for binders and beams for the buildings which the kings of Judah had let go to ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.12'>And the men did the work faithfully. Over them were set Jahath and Obadi'ah the Levites, of the sons of Merar'i, and Zechari'ah and Meshul'lam, of the sons of the Ko'hathites, to have oversight. The Levites, all who were skilful with instruments of music,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.13'>were over the burden bearers and directed all who did work in every kind of service; and some of the Levites were scribes, and officials, and gatekeepers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.14'>While they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of the LORD, Hilki'ah the priest found the book of the law of the LORD given through Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.15'>Then Hilki'ah said to Shaphan the secretary, "I have found the book of the law in the house of the LORD"; and Hilki'ah gave the book to Shaphan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.16'>Shaphan brought the book to the king, and further reported to the king, "All that was committed to your servants they are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.17'>They have emptied out the money that was found in the house of the LORD and have delivered it into the hand of the overseers and the workmen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.18'>Then Shaphan the secretary told the king, "Hilki'ah the priest has given me a book." And Shaphan read it before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.19'>When the king heard the words of the law he rent his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.20'>And the king commanded Hilki'ah, Ahi'kam the son of Shaphan, Abdon the son of Micah, Shaphan the secretary, and Asai'ah the king's servant, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.21'>"Go, inquire of the LORD for me and for those who are left in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out on us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the LORD, to do according to all that is written in this book."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.22'>So Hilki'ah and those whom the king had sent went to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe (now she dwelt in Jerusalem in the Second Quarter) and spoke to her to that effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.23'>And she said to them, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: `Tell the man who sent you to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.24'>Thus says the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this place and upon its inhabitants, all the curses that are written in the book which was read before the king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.25'>Because they have forsaken me and have burned incense to other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the works of their hands, therefore my wrath will be poured out upon this place and will not be quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.26'>But to the king of Judah, who sent you to inquire of the LORD, thus shall you say to him, Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: Regarding the words which you have heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.27'>because your heart was penitent and you humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this place and its inhabitants, and you have humbled yourself before me, and have rent your clothes and wept before me, I also have heard you, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.28'>Behold, I will gather you to your fathers, and you shall be gathered to your grave in peace, and your eyes shall not see all the evil which I will bring upon this place and its inhabitants.'" And they brought back word to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.29'>Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.30'>And the king went up to the house of the LORD, with all the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem and the priests and the Levites, all the people both great and small; and he read in their hearing all the words of the book of the covenant which had been found in the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.31'>And the king stood in his place and made a covenant before the LORD, to walk after the LORD and to keep his commandments and his testimonies and his statutes, with all his heart and all his soul, to perform the words of the covenant that were written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.32'>Then he made all who were present in Jerusalem and in Benjamin stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.33'>And Josi'ah took away all the abominations from all the territory that belonged to the people of Israel, and made all who were in Israel serve the LORD their God. All his days they did not turn away from following the LORD the God of their fathers.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.35'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.1'>Josi'ah kept a passover to the LORD in Jerusalem; and they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.2'>He appointed the priests to their offices and encouraged them in the service of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.3'>And he said to the Levites who taught all Israel and who were holy to the LORD, "Put the holy ark in the house which Solomon the son of David, king of Israel, built; you need no longer carry it upon your shoulders. Now serve the LORD your God and his people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.4'>Prepare yourselves according to your fathers' houses by your divisions, following the directions of David king of Israel and the directions of Solomon his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.5'>And stand in the holy place according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of your brethren the lay people, and let there be for each a part of a father's house of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.6'>And kill the passover lamb, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare for your brethren, to do according to the word of the LORD by Moses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.7'>Then Josi'ah contributed to the lay people, as passover offerings for all that were present, lambs and kids from the flock to the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bulls; these were from the king's possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.8'>And his princes contributed willingly to the people, to the priests, and to the Levites. Hilki'ah, Zechari'ah, and Jehi'el, the chief officers of the house of God, gave to the priests for the passover offerings two thousand six hundred lambs and kids and three hundred bulls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.9'>Conani'ah also, and Shemai'ah and Nethan'el his brothers, and Hashabi'ah and Je-i'el and Jo'zabad, the chiefs of the Levites, gave to the Levites for the passover offerings five thousand lambs and kids and five hundred bulls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.10'>When the service had been prepared for, the priests stood in their place, and the Levites in their divisions according to the king's command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.11'>And they killed the passover lamb, and the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from them while the Levites flayed the victims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.12'>And they set aside the burnt offerings that they might distribute them according to the groupings of the fathers' houses of the lay people, to offer to the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses. And so they did with the bulls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.13'>And they roasted the passover lamb with fire according to the ordinance; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, in caldrons, and in pans, and carried them quickly to all the lay people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.14'>And afterward they prepared for themselves and for the priests, because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in offering the burnt offerings and the fat parts until night; so the Levites prepared for themselves and for the priests the sons of Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.15'>The singers, the sons of Asaph, were in their place according to the command of David, and Asaph, and Heman, and Jedu'thun the king's seer; and the gatekeepers were at each gate; they did not need to depart from their service, for their brethren the Levites prepared for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.16'>So all the service of the LORD was prepared that day, to keep the passover and to offer burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD, according to the command of King Josi'ah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.17'>And the people of Israel who were present kept the passover at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.18'>No passover like it had been kept in Israel since the days of Samuel the prophet; none of the kings of Israel had kept such a passover as was kept by Josi'ah, and the priests and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.19'>In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josi'ah this passover was kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.20'>After all this, when Josi'ah had prepared the temple, Neco king of Egypt went up to fight at Car'chemish on the Euphra'tes and Josi'ah went out against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.21'>But he sent envoys to him, saying, "What have we to do with each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day, but against the house with which I am at war; and God has commanded me to make haste. Cease opposing God, who is with me, lest he destroy you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.22'>Nevertheless Josi'ah would not turn away from him, but disguised himself in order to fight with him. He did not listen to the words of Neco from the mouth of God, but joined battle in the plain of Megid'do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.23'>And the archers shot King Josi'ah; and the king said to his servants, "Take me away, for I am badly wounded."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.24'>So his servants took him out of the chariot and carried him in his second chariot and brought him to Jerusalem. And he died, and was buried in the tombs of his fathers. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josi'ah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.25'>Jeremiah also uttered a lament for Josi'ah; and all the singing men and singing women have spoken of Josi'ah in their laments to this day. They made these an ordinance in Israel; behold, they are written in the Laments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.26'>Now the rest of the acts of Josi'ah, and his good deeds according to what is written in the law of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.27'>and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.36'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.1'>The people of the land took Jeho'ahaz the son of Josi'ah and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.2'>Jeho'ahaz was twenty-three years old when he began to reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.3'>Then the king of Egypt deposed him in Jerusalem and laid upon the land a tribute of a hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.4'>And the king of Egypt made Eli'akim his brother king over Judah and Jerusalem, and changed his name to Jehoi'akim; but Neco took Jeho'ahaz his brother and carried him to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.5'>Jehoi'akim was twenty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.6'>Against him came up Nebuchadnez'zar king of Babylon, and bound him in fetters to take him to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.7'>Nebuchadnez'zar also carried part of the vessels of the house of the LORD to Babylon and put them in his palace in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.8'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoi'akim, and the abominations which he did, and what was found against him, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah; and Jehoi'achin his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.9'>Jehoi'achin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.10'>In the spring of the year King Nebuchadnez'zar sent and brought him to Babylon, with the precious vessels of the house of the LORD, and made his brother Zedeki'ah king over Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.11'>Zedeki'ah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.12'>He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God. He did not humble himself before Jeremiah the prophet, who spoke from the mouth of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.13'>He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnez'zar, who had made him swear by God; he stiffened his neck and hardened his heart against turning to the LORD, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.14'>All the leading priests and the people likewise were exceedingly unfaithful, following all the abominations of the nations; and they polluted the house of the LORD which he had hallowed in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.15'>The LORD, the God of their fathers, sent persistently to them by his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on his dwelling place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.16'>but they kept mocking the messengers of God, despising his words, and scoffing at his prophets, till the wrath of the LORD rose against his people, till there was no remedy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.17'>Therefore he brought up against them the king of the Chalde'ans, who slew their young men with the sword in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion on young man or virgin, old man or aged; he gave them all into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.18'>And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of the king and of his princes, all these he brought to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.19'>And they burned the house of God, and broke down the wall of Jerusalem, and burned all its palaces with fire, and destroyed all its precious vessels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.22'>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.23'>"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, `The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
