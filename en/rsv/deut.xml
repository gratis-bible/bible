      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <title>You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I dwell; for I the LORD dwell in the midst of the people of Israel."</title>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, Laban, Haze'roth, and Di'-zahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>It is eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Se'ir to Ka'desh-bar'nea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And in the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the people of Israel according to all that the LORD had given him in commandment to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ash'taroth and in Ed're-i.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, Moses undertook to explain this law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>"The LORD our God said to us in Horeb, `You have stayed long enough at this mountain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>turn and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland, and in the Negeb, and by the seacoast, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphra'tes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>Behold, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their descendants after them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>"At that time I said to you, `I am not able alone to bear you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>the LORD your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>May the LORD, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How can I bear alone the weight and burden of you and your strife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Choose wise, understanding, and experienced men, according to your tribes, and I will appoint them as your heads.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And you answered me, `The thing that you have spoken is good for us to do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took the heads of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and set them as heads over you, commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, commanders of fifties, commanders of tens, and officers, throughout your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your judges at that time, `Hear the cases between your brethren, and judge righteously between a man and his brother or the alien that is with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>You shall not be partial in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man, for the judgment is God's; and the case that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>And I commanded you at that time all the things that you should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>"And we set out from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Ka'desh-bar'nea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>And I said to you, `You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God gives us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you; go up, take possession, as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has told you; do not fear or be dismayed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>Then all of you came near me, and said, `Let us send men before us, that they may explore the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up and the cities into which we shall come.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>The thing seemed good to me, and I took twelve men of you, one man for each tribe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took in their hands some of the fruit of the land and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, `It is a good land which the LORD our God gives us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>"Yet you would not go up, but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>and you murmured in your tents, and said, `Because the LORD hated us he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to give us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Whither are we going up? Our brethren have made our hearts melt, saying, "The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to heaven; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said to you, `Do not be in dread or afraid of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>The LORD your God who goes before you will himself fight for you, just as he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>and in the wilderness, where you have seen how the LORD your God bore you, as a man bears his son, in all the way that you went until you came to this place.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>Yet in spite of this word you did not believe the LORD your God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>who went before you in the way to seek you out a place to pitch your tents, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>"And the LORD heard your words, and was angered, and he swore,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>`Not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land which I swore to give to your fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>except Caleb the son of Jephun'neh; he shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land upon which he has trodden, because he has wholly followed the LORD!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>The LORD was angry with me also on your account, and said, `You also shall not go in there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter; encourage him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>Moreover your little ones, who you said would become a prey, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, shall go in there, and to them I will give it, and they shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turn, and journey into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>"Then you answered me, `We have sinned against the LORD; we will go up and fight, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' And every man of you girded on his weapons of war, and thought it easy to go up into the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>And the LORD said to me, `Say to them, Do not go up or fight, for I am not in the midst of you; lest you be defeated before your enemies.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spoke to you, and you would not hearken; but you rebelled against the command of the LORD, and were presumptuous and went up into the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do and beat you down in Se'ir as far as Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>And you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD did not hearken to your voice or give ear to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>So you remained at Kadesh many days, the days that you remained there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>"Then we turned, and journeyed into the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea, as the LORD told me; and for many days we went about Mount Se'ir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>Then the LORD said to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>`You have been going about this mountain country long enough; turn northward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And command the people, You are about to pass through the territory of your brethren the sons of Esau, who live in Se'ir; and they will be afraid of you. So take good heed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>do not contend with them; for I will not give you any of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on, because I have given Mount Se'ir to Esau as a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>You shall purchase food from them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For the LORD your God has blessed you in all the work of your hands; he knows your going through this great wilderness; these forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>So we went on, away from our brethren the sons of Esau who live in Se'ir, away from the Arabah road from Elath and E'zion-ge'ber.  "And we turned and went in the direction of the wilderness of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And the LORD said to me, `Do not harass Moab or contend with them in battle, for I will not give you any of their land for a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons of Lot for a possession.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>(The Emim formerly lived there, a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>like the Anakim they are also known as Reph'aim, but the Moabites call them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>The Horites also lived in Se'ir formerly, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them, and destroyed them from before them, and settled in their stead; as Israel did to the land of their possession, which the LORD gave to them.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>`Now rise up, and go over the brook Zered.' So we went over the brook Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>And the time from our leaving Ka'desh-bar'nea until we crossed the brook Zered was thirty-eight years, until the entire generation, that is, the men of war, had perished from the camp, as the LORD had sworn to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from the camp, until they had perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>"So when all the men of war had perished and were dead from among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>the LORD said to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>`This day you are to pass over the boundary of Moab at Ar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>and when you approach the frontier of the sons of Ammon, do not harass them or contend with them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot for a possession.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>(That also is known as a land of Reph'aim; Reph'aim formerly lived there, but the Ammonites call them Zamzum'mim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>a people great and many, and tall as the Anakim; but the LORD destroyed them before them; and they dispossessed them, and settled in their stead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>as he did for the sons of Esau, who live in Se'ir, when he destroyed the Horites before them, and they dispossessed them, and settled in their stead even to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caph'torim, who came from Caphtor, destroyed them and settled in their stead.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>`Rise up, take your journey, and go over the valley of the Arnon; behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to take possession, and contend with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day I will begin to put the dread and fear of you upon the peoples that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear the report of you and shall tremble and be in anguish because of you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>"So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Ked'emoth to Sihon the king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>`Let me pass through your land; I will go only by the road, I will turn aside neither to the right nor to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat, and give me water for money, that I may drink; only let me pass through on foot,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>as the sons of Esau who live in Se'ir and the Moabites who live in Ar did for me, until I go over the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God gives to us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon the king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, that he might give him into your hand, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>And the LORD said to me, `Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and his land over to you; begin to take possession, that you may occupy his land.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And the LORD our God gave him over to us; and we defeated him and his sons and all his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we captured all his cities at that time and utterly destroyed every city, men, women, and children; we left none remaining;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>only the cattle we took as spoil for ourselves, with the booty of the cities which we captured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aro'er, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and from the city that is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; the LORD our God gave all into our hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only to the land of the sons of Ammon you did not draw near, that is, to all the banks of the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God forbade us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>"Then we turned and went up the way to Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Ed're-i.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>But the LORD said to me, `Do not fear him; for I have given him and all his people and his land into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>So the LORD our God gave into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people; and we smote him until no survivor was left to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we took all his cities at that time--there was not a city which we did not take from them--sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars, besides very many unwalled villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon the king of Heshbon, destroying every city, men, women, and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the cattle and the spoil of the cities we took as our booty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>So we took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>(the Sido'nians call Hermon Si'rion, while the Amorites call it Senir),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>all the cities of the tableland and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Sal'ecah and Ed're-i, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>(For only Og the king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the Reph'aim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? Nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, according to the common cubit.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>"When we took possession of this land at that time, I gave to the Reubenites and the Gadites the territory beginning at Aro'er, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead with its cities;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, that is, all the region of Argob, I gave to the half-tribe of Manas'seh. (The whole of that Bashan is called the land of Reph'aim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Ja'ir the Manas'site took all the region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of the Gesh'urites and the Ma-ac'athites, and called the villages after his own name, Hav'voth-ja'ir, as it is to this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>To Machir I gave Gilead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>and to the Reubenites and the Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the valley of the Arnon, with the middle of the valley as a boundary, as far over as the river Jabbok, the boundary of the Ammonites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>the Arabah also, with the Jordan as the boundary, from Chin'nereth as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah on the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>"And I commanded you at that time, saying, `The LORD your God has given you this land to possess; all your men of valor shall pass over armed before your brethren the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>But your wives, your little ones, and your cattle (I know that you have many cattle) shall remain in the cities which I have given you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until the LORD gives rest to your brethren, as to you, and they also occupy the land which the LORD your God gives them beyond the Jordan; then you shall return every man to his possession which I have given you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>And I commanded Joshua at that time, `Your eyes have seen all that the LORD your God has done to these two kings; so will the LORD do to all the kingdoms into which you are going over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>You shall not fear them; for it is the LORD your God who fights for you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>"And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>`O Lord GOD, thou hast only begun to show thy servant thy greatness and thy mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth who can do such works and mighty acts as thine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>Let me go over, I pray, and see the good land beyond the Jordan, that goodly hill country, and Lebanon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But the LORD was angry with me on your account, and would not hearken to me; and the LORD said to me, `Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward and northward and southward and eastward, and behold it with your eyes; for you shall not go over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But charge Joshua, and encourage and strengthen him; for he shall go over at the head of this people, and he shall put them in possession of the land which you shall see.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we remained in the valley opposite Beth-pe'or.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>"And now, O Israel, give heed to the statutes and the ordinances which I teach you, and do them; that you may live, and go in and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, gives you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.2'>You shall not add to the word which I command you, nor take from it; that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.3'>Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Ba'al-pe'or; for the LORD your God destroyed from among you all the men who followed the Ba'al of Pe'or;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.4'>but you who held fast to the LORD your God are all alive this day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.33.2'>He said, "The LORD came from Sinai, and dawned from Se'ir upon us; he shone forth from Mount Paran, he came from the ten thousands of holy ones, with flaming fire at his right hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.3'>Yea, he loved his people; all those consecrated to him were in his hand; so they followed in thy steps, receiving direction from thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.4'>when Moses commanded us a law, as a possession for the assembly of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.5'>Thus the LORD became king in Jesh'urun, when the heads of the people were gathered, all the tribes of Israel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.6'>"Let Reuben live, and not die, nor let his men be few."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.7'>And this he said of Judah: "Hear, O LORD, the voice of Judah, and bring him in to his people. With thy hands contend for him, and be a help against his adversaries."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.8'>And of Levi he said, "Give to Levi thy Thummim, and thy Urim to thy godly one, whom thou didst test at Massah, with whom thou didst strive at the waters of Mer'ibah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.9'>who said of his father and mother, `I regard them not'; he disowned his brothers, and ignored his children. For they observed thy word, and kept thy covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.10'>They shall teach Jacob thy ordinances, and Israel thy law; they shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt offering upon thy altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.11'>Bless, O LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands; crush the loins of his adversaries, of those that hate him, that they rise not again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.12'>Of Benjamin he said, "The beloved of the LORD, he dwells in safety by him; he encompasses him all the day long, and makes his dwelling between his shoulders."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.13'>And of Joseph he said, "Blessed by the LORD be his land, with the choicest gifts of heaven above, and of the deep that couches beneath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.14'>with the choicest fruits of the sun, and the rich yield of the months,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.15'>with the finest produce of the ancient mountains, and the abundance of the everlasting hills,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.16'>with the best gifts of the earth and its fulness, and the favor of him that dwelt in the bush. Let these come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the crown of the head of him that is prince among his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.17'>His firstling bull has majesty, and his horns are the horns of a wild ox; with them he shall push the peoples, all of them, to the ends of the earth; such are the ten thousands of E'phraim, and such are the thousands of Manas'seh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.18'>And of Zeb'ulun he said, "Rejoice, Zeb'ulun, in your going out; and Is'sachar, in your tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.19'>They shall call peoples to their mountain; there they offer right sacrifices; for they suck the affluence of the seas and the hidden treasures of the sand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.20'>And of Gad he said, "Blessed be he who enlarges Gad! Gad couches like a lion, he tears the arm, and the crown of the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.21'>He chose the best of the land for himself, for there a commander's portion was reserved; and he came to the heads of the people, with Israel he executed the commands and just decrees of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.22'>And of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's whelp, that leaps forth from Bashan."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.23'>And of Naph'tali he said, "O Naph'tali, satisfied with favor, and full of the blessing of the LORD, possess the lake and the south."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.24'>And of Asher he said, "Blessed above sons be Asher; let him be the favorite of his brothers, and let him dip his foot in oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.25'>Your bars shall be iron and bronze; and as your days, so shall your strength be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.26'>"There is none like God, O Jesh'urun, who rides through the heavens to your help, and in his majesty through the skies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.27'>The eternal God is your dwelling place, and underneath are the everlasting arms. And he thrust out the enemy before you, and said, Destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.28'>So Israel dwelt in safety, the fountain of Jacob alone, in a land of grain and wine; yea, his heavens drop down dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.33.29'>Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and the sword of your triumph! Your enemies shall come fawning to you; and you shall tread upon their high places."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.34'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.1'>And Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, which is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, Gilead as far as Dan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.2'>all Naph'tali, the land of E'phraim and Manas'seh, all the land of Judah as far as the Western Sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.3'>the Negeb, and the Plain, that is, the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, as far as Zo'ar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.4'>And the LORD said to him, "This is the land of which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, `I will give it to your descendants.' I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.5'>So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.6'>and he buried him in the valley in the land of Moab opposite Beth-pe'or; but no man knows the place of his burial to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.7'>Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.8'>And the people of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.9'>And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; so the people of Israel obeyed him, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.10'>And there has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.11'>none like him for all the signs and the wonders which the LORD sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to all his land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.34.12'>and for all the mighty power and all the great and terrible deeds which Moses wrought in the sight of all Israel.</verse>
