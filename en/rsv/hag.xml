      <chapter osisID='Hag.1'>
        <title>This is the exultant city that dwelt secure, that said to herself, "I am and there is none else." What a desolation she has become, a lair for wild beasts! Every one who passes by her hisses and shakes his fist.</title>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, on the first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet to Zerub'babel the son of She-al'ti-el, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehoz'adak, the high priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'>"Thus says the LORD of hosts: This people say the time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'>Then the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>"Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses, while this house lies in ruins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'>Now therefore thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider how you have fared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'>You have sown much, and harvested little; you eat, but you never have enough; you drink, but you never have your fill; you clothe yourselves, but no one is warm; and he who earns wages earns wages to put them into a bag with holes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'>"Thus says the LORD of hosts: Consider how you have fared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'>Go up to the hills and bring wood and build the house, that I may take pleasure in it and that I may appear in my glory, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>You have looked for much, and, lo, it came to little; and when you brought it home, I blew it away. Why? says the LORD of hosts. Because of my house that lies in ruins, while you busy yourselves each with his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'>Therefore the heavens above you have withheld the dew, and the earth has withheld its produce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'>And I have called for a drought upon the land and the hills, upon the grain, the new wine, the oil, upon what the ground brings forth, upon men and cattle, and upon all their labors."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'>Then Zerub'babel the son of She-al'ti-el, and Joshua the son of Jehoz'adak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him; and the people feared before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'>Then Haggai, the messenger of the LORD, spoke to the people with the LORD's message, "I am with you, says the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'>And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerub'babel the son of She-al'ti-el, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehoz'adak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people; and they came and worked on the house of the LORD of hosts, their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'>on the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth month.  In the second year of Darius the king,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'>in the seventh month, on the twenty-first day of the month, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'>"Speak now to Zerub'babel the son of She-al'ti-el, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehoz'adak, the high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'>`Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? How do you see it now? Is it not in your sight as nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'>Yet now take courage, O Zerub'babel, says the LORD; take courage, O Joshua, son of Jehoz'adak, the high priest; take courage, all you people of the land, says the LORD; work, for I am with you, says the LORD of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>according to the promise that I made you when you came out of Egypt. My Spirit abides among you; fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'>For thus says the LORD of hosts: Once again, in a little while, I will shake the heavens and the earth and the sea and the dry land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'>and I will shake all nations, so that the treasures of all nations shall come in, and I will fill this house with splendor, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'>The latter splendor of this house shall be greater than the former, says the LORD of hosts; and in this place I will give prosperity, says the LORD of hosts.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'>On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the LORD came by Haggai the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'>"Thus says the LORD of hosts: Ask the priests to decide this question,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'>`If one carries holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and touches with his skirt bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any kind of food, does it become holy?'" The priests answered, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'>Then said Haggai, "If one who is unclean by contact with a dead body touches any of these, does it become unclean?" The priests answered, "It does become unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'>Then Haggai said, "So is it with this people, and with this nation before me, says the LORD; and so with every work of their hands; and what they offer there is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'>Pray now, consider what will come to pass from this day onward. Before a stone was placed upon a stone in the temple of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'>how did you fare? When one came to a heap of twenty measures, there were but ten; when one came to the winevat to draw fifty measures, there were but twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'>I smote you and all the products of your toil with blight and mildew and hail; yet you did not return to me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'>Consider from this day onward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month. Since the day that the foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>Is the seed yet in the barn? Do the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, and the olive tree still yield nothing? From this day on I will bless you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'>The word of the LORD came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'>"Speak to Zerub'babel, governor of Judah, saying, I am about to shake the heavens and the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'>and to overthrow the throne of kingdoms; I am about to destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations, and overthrow the chariots and their riders; and the horses and their riders shall go down, every one by the sword of his fellow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'>On that day, says the LORD of hosts, I will take you, O Zerub'babel my servant, the son of She-al'ti-el, says the LORD, and make you like a signet ring; for I have chosen you, says the LORD of hosts."</verse>
