      <chapter osisID='Jer.1'>
        <title>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, says the LORD."</title>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.1'>The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilki'ah, of the priests who were in An'athoth in the land of Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.2'>to whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josi'ah the son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.3'>It came also in the days of Jehoi'akim the son of Josi'ah, king of Judah, and until the end of the eleventh year of Zedeki'ah, the son of Josi'ah, king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.4'>Now the word of the LORD came to me saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.5'>"Before I formed you in the womb I knew you, and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.6'>Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD! Behold, I do not know how to speak, for I am only a youth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.7'>But the LORD said to me, "Do not say, `I am only a youth'; for to all to whom I send you you shall go, and whatever I command you you shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.8'>Be not afraid of them, for I am with you to deliver you, says the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.9'>Then the LORD put forth his hand and touched my mouth; and the LORD said to me, "Behold, I have put my words in your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.10'>See, I have set you this day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.11'>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" And I said, "I see a rod of almond."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.12'>Then the LORD said to me, "You have seen well, for I am watching over my word to perform it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.13'>The word of the LORD came to me a second time, saying, "What do you see?" And I said, "I see a boiling pot, facing away from the north."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.14'>Then the LORD said to me, "Out of the north evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.15'>For, lo, I am calling all the tribes of the kingdoms of the north, says the LORD; and they shall come and every one shall set his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all its walls round about, and against all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.16'>And I will utter my judgments against them, for all their wickedness in forsaking me; they have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.17'>But you, gird up your loins; arise, and say to them everything that I command you. Do not be dismayed by them, lest I dismay you before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.18'>And I, behold, I make you this day a fortified city, an iron pillar, and bronze walls, against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, its princes, its priests, and the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.1.19'>They will fight against you; but they shall not prevail against you, for I am with you, says the LORD, to deliver you."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.2'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.1'>The word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.2'>"Go and proclaim in the hearing of Jerusalem, Thus says the LORD, I remember the devotion of your youth, your love as a bride, how you followed me in the wilderness, in a land not sown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.3'>Israel was holy to the LORD, the first fruits of his harvest. All who ate of it became guilty; evil came upon them, says the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.4'>Hear the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.5'>Thus says the LORD: "What wrong did your fathers find in me that they went far from me, and went after worthlessness, and became worthless?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.6'>They did not say, `Where is the LORD who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us in the wilderness, in a land of deserts and pits, in a land of drought and deep darkness, in a land that none passes through, where no man dwells?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.7'>And I brought you into a plentiful land to enjoy its fruits and its good things. But when you came in you defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.8'>The priests did not say, `Where is the LORD?' Those who handle the law did not know me; the rulers transgressed against me; the prophets prophesied by Ba'al, and went after things that do not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.9'>"Therefore I still contend with you, says the LORD, and with your children's children I will contend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.10'>For cross to the coasts of Cyprus and see, or send to Kedar and examine with care; see if there has been such a thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.11'>Has a nation changed its gods, even though they are no gods? But my people have changed their glory for that which does not profit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.12'>Be appalled, O heavens, at this, be shocked, be utterly desolate, says the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.13'>for my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken me, the fountain of living waters, and hewed out cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns, that can hold no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.14'>"Is Israel a slave? Is he a homeborn servant? Why then has he become a prey?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.15'>The lions have roared against him, they have roared loudly. They have made his land a waste; his cities are in ruins, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.16'>Moreover, the men of Memphis and Tah'panhes have broken the crown of your head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.17'>Have you not brought this upon yourself by forsaking the LORD your God, when he led you in the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.18'>And now what do you gain by going to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile? Or what do you gain by going to Assyria, to drink the waters of the Euphra'tes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.19'>Your wickedness will chasten you, and your apostasy will reprove you. Know and see that it is evil and bitter for you to forsake the LORD your God; the fear of me is not in you, says the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.20'>"For long ago you broke your yoke and burst your bonds; and you said, `I will not serve.' Yea, upon every high hill and under every green tree you bowed down as a harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.21'>Yet I planted you a choice vine, wholly of pure seed. How then have you turned degenerate and become a wild vine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.22'>Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.23'>How can you say, `I am not defiled, I have not gone after the Ba'als'? Look at your way in the valley; know what you have done--a restive young camel interlacing her tracks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.24'>a wild ass used to the wilderness, in her heat sniffing the wind! Who can restrain her lust? None who seek her need weary themselves; in her month they will find her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.25'>Keep your feet from going unshod and your throat from thirst. But you said, `It is hopeless, for I have loved strangers, and after them I will go.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.26'>"As a thief is shamed when caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed: they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.27'>who say to a tree, `You are my father,' and to a stone, `You gave me birth.' For they have turned their back to me, and not their face. But in the time of their trouble they say, `Arise and save us!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.28'>But where are your gods that you made for yourself? Let them arise, if they can save you, in your time of trouble; for as many as your cities are your gods, O Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.29'>"Why do you complain against me? You have all rebelled against me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.30'>In vain have I smitten your children, they took no correction; your own sword devoured your prophets like a ravening lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.31'>And you, O generation, heed the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Why then do my people say, `We are free, we will come no more to thee'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.32'>Can a maiden forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? Yet my people have forgotten me days without number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.33'>"How well you direct your course to seek lovers! So that even to wicked women you have taught your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.34'>Also on your skirts is found the lifeblood of guiltless poor; you did not find them breaking in. Yet in spite of all these things</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.35'>you say, `I am innocent; surely his anger has turned from me.' Behold, I will bring you to judgment for saying, `I have not sinned.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.36'>How lightly you gad about, changing your way! You shall be put to shame by Egypt as you were put to shame by Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.2.37'>From it too you will come away with your hands upon your head, for the LORD has rejected those in whom you trust, and you will not prosper by them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.3'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.1'>"If a man divorces his wife and she goes from him and becomes another man's wife, will he return to her? Would not that land be greatly polluted? You have played the harlot with many lovers; and would you return to me? says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.2'>Lift up your eyes to the bare heights, and see! Where have you not been lain with? By the waysides you have sat awaiting lovers like an Arab in the wilderness. You have polluted the land with your vile harlotry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.3'>Therefore the showers have been withheld, and the spring rain has not come; yet you have a harlot's brow, you refuse to be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.4'>Have you not just now called to me, `My father, thou art the friend of my youth--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.5'>will he be angry for ever, will he be indignant to the end?' Behold, you have spoken, but you have done all the evil that you could."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.6'>The LORD said to me in the days of King Josi'ah: "Have you seen what she did, that faithless one, Israel, how she went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and there played the harlot?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.7'>And I thought, `After she has done all this she will return to me'; but she did not return, and her false sister Judah saw it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.8'>She saw that for all the adulteries of that faithless one, Israel, I had sent her away with a decree of divorce; yet her false sister Judah did not fear, but she too went and played the harlot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.9'>Because harlotry was so light to her, she polluted the land, committing adultery with stone and tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.10'>Yet for all this her false sister Judah did not return to me with her whole heart, but in pretense, says the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.11'>And the LORD said to me, "Faithless Israel has shown herself less guilty than false Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.12'>Go, and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, `Return, faithless Israel, says the LORD. I will not look on you in anger, for I am merciful, says the LORD; I will not be angry for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.13'>Only acknowledge your guilt, that you rebelled against the LORD your God and scattered your favors among strangers under every green tree, and that you have not obeyed my voice, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.14'>Return, O faithless children, says the LORD; for I am your master; I will take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.15'>"`And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will feed you with knowledge and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.16'>And when you have multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, says the LORD, they shall no more say, "The ark of the covenant of the LORD." It shall not come to mind, or be remembered, or missed; it shall not be made again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.17'>At that time Jerusalem shall be called the throne of the LORD, and all nations shall gather to it, to the presence of the LORD in Jerusalem, and they shall no more stubbornly follow their own evil heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.18'>In those days the house of Judah shall join the house of Israel, and together they shall come from the land of the north to the land that I gave your fathers for a heritage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.19'>"`I thought how I would set you among my sons, and give you a pleasant land, a heritage most beauteous of all nations. And I thought you would call me, My Father, and would not turn from following me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.20'>Surely, as a faithless wife leaves her husband, so have you been faithless to me, O house of Israel, says the LORD.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.21'>A voice on the bare heights is heard, the weeping and pleading of Israel's sons, because they have perverted their way, they have forgotten the LORD their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.22'>"Return, O faithless sons, I will heal your faithlessness." "Behold, we come to thee; for thou art the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.23'>Truly the hills are a delusion, the orgies on the mountains. Truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.24'>"But from our youth the shameful thing has devoured all for which our fathers labored, their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.3.25'>Let us lie down in our shame, and let our dishonor cover us; for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day; and we have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.4'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.1'>"If you return, O Israel, says the LORD, to me you should return. If you remove your abominations from my presence, and do not waver,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.2'>and if you swear, `As the LORD lives,' in truth, in justice, and in uprightness, then nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.3'>For thus says the LORD to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: "Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.4'>Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, remove the foreskin of your hearts, O men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; lest my wrath go forth like fire, and burn with none to quench it, because of the evil of your doings."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.5'>Declare in Judah, and proclaim in Jerusalem, and say, "Blow the trumpet through the land; cry aloud and say, `Assemble, and let us go into the fortified cities!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.6'>Raise a standard toward Zion, flee for safety, stay not, for I bring evil from the north, and great destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.7'>A lion has gone up from his thicket, a destroyer of nations has set out; he has gone forth from his place to make your land a waste; your cities will be ruins without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.8'>For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and wail; for the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned back from us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.9'>"In that day, says the LORD, courage shall fail both king and princes; the priests shall be appalled and the prophets astounded."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.10'>Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD, surely thou hast utterly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, `It shall be well with you'; whereas the sword has reached their very life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.11'>At that time it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A hot wind from the bare heights in the desert toward the daughter of my people, not to winnow or cleanse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.12'>a wind too full for this comes for me. Now it is I who speak in judgment upon them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.13'>Behold, he comes up like clouds, his chariots like the whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles-- woe to us, for we are ruined!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.14'>O Jerusalem, wash your heart from wickedness, that you may be saved. How long shall your evil thoughts lodge within you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.15'>For a voice declares from Dan and proclaims evil from Mount E'phraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.16'>Warn the nations that he is coming; announce to Jerusalem, "Besiegers come from a distant land; they shout against the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.17'>Like keepers of a field are they against her round about, because she has rebelled against me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.18'>Your ways and your doings have brought this upon you. This is your doom, and it is bitter; it has reached your very heart."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.19'>My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain! Oh, the walls of my heart! My heart is beating wildly; I cannot keep silent; for I hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.20'>Disaster follows hard on disaster, the whole land is laid waste. Suddenly my tents are destroyed, my curtains in a moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.21'>How long must I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.22'>"For my people are foolish, they know me not; they are stupid children, they have no understanding. They are skilled in doing evil, but how to do good they know not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.23'>I looked on the earth, and lo, it was waste and void; and to the heavens, and they had no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.24'>I looked on the mountains, and lo, they were quaking, and all the hills moved to and fro.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.25'>I looked, and lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the air had fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.26'>I looked, and lo, the fruitful land was a desert, and all its cities were laid in ruins before the LORD, before his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.27'>For thus says the LORD, "The whole land shall be a desolation; yet I will not make a full end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.28'>For this the earth shall mourn, and the heavens above be black; for I have spoken, I have purposed; I have not relented nor will I turn back."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.29'>At the noise of horseman and archer every city takes to flight; they enter thickets; they climb among rocks; all the cities are forsaken, and no man dwells in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.30'>And you, O desolate one, what do you mean that you dress in scarlet, that you deck yourself with ornaments of gold, that you enlarge your eyes with paint? In vain you beautify yourself. Your lovers despise you; they seek your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.4.31'>For I heard a cry as of a woman in travail, anguish as of one bringing forth her first child, the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for breath, stretching out her hands, "Woe is me! I am fainting before murderers."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.5'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.1'>Run to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, look and take note! Search her squares to see if you can find a man, one who does justice and seeks truth; that I may pardon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.2'>Though they say, "As the LORD lives," yet they swear falsely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.3'>O LORD, do not thy eyes look for truth? Thou hast smitten them, but they felt no anguish; thou hast consumed them, but they refused to take correction. They have made their faces harder than rock; they have refused to repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.4'>Then I said, "These are only the poor, they have no sense; for they do not know the way of the LORD, the law of their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.5'>I will go to the great, and will speak to them; for they know the way of the LORD, the law of their God." But they all alike had broken the yoke, they had burst the bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.6'>Therefore a lion from the forest shall slay them, a wolf from the desert shall destroy them. A leopard is watching against their cities, every one who goes out of them shall be torn in pieces; because their transgressions are many, their apostasies are great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.5.7'>"How can I pardon you? Your children have forsaken me, and have sworn by those who are no gods. When I fed them to the full, they committed adultery and trooped to the houses of harlots.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.1'>The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedeki'ah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrez'zar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.2'>At that time the army of the king of Babylon was besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was shut up in the court of the guard which was in the palace of the king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.3'>For Zedeki'ah king of Judah had imprisoned him, saying, "Why do you prophesy and say, `Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.4'>Zedeki'ah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chalde'ans, but shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.5'>and he shall take Zedeki'ah to Babylon, and there he shall remain until I visit him, says the LORD; though you fight against the Chalde'ans, you shall not succeed'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.6'>Jeremiah said, "The word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.7'>Behold, Han'amel the son of Shallum your uncle will come to you and say, `Buy my field which is at An'athoth, for the right of redemption by purchase is yours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.8'>Then Han'amel my cousin came to me in the court of the guard, in accordance with the word of the LORD, and said to me, `Buy my field which is at An'athoth in the land of Benjamin, for the right of possession and redemption is yours; buy it for yourself.' Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.9'>"And I bought the field at An'athoth from Han'amel my cousin, and weighed out the money to him, seventeen shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.10'>I signed the deed, sealed it, got witnesses, and weighed the money on scales.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.11'>Then I took the sealed deed of purchase, containing the terms and conditions, and the open copy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.12'>and I gave the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neri'ah son of Mahsei'ah, in the presence of Han'amel my cousin, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of purchase, and in the presence of all the Jews who were sitting in the court of the guard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.13'>I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.14'>`Thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these deeds, both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed, and put them in an earthenware vessel, that they may last for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.15'>For thus says the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.16'>"After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch the son of Neri'ah, I prayed to the LORD, saying:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.24'>Behold, the siege mounds have come up to the city to take it, and because of sword and famine and pestilence the city is given into the hands of the Chalde'ans who are fighting against it. What thou didst speak has come to pass, and behold, thou seest it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.25'>Yet thou, O Lord GOD, hast said to me, "Buy the field for money and get witnesses"--though the city is given into the hands of the Chalde'ans.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.26'>The word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.32.28'>Therefore, thus says the LORD: Behold, I am giving this city into the hands of the Chalde'ans and into the hand of Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.29'>The Chalde'ans who are fighting against this city shall come and set this city on fire, and burn it, with the houses on whose roofs incense has been offered to Ba'al and drink offerings have been poured out to other gods, to provoke me to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.30'>For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done nothing but evil in my sight from their youth; the sons of Israel have done nothing but provoke me to anger by the work of their hands, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.31'>This city has aroused my anger and wrath, from the day it was built to this day, so that I will remove it from my sight</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.32'>because of all the evil of the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah which they did to provoke me to anger--their kings and their princes, their priests and their prophets, the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.33'>They have turned to me their back and not their face; and though I have taught them persistently they have not listened to receive instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.34'>They set up their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to defile it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.35'>They built the high places of Ba'al in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to offer up their sons and daughters to Molech, though I did not command them, nor did it enter into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.36'>"Now therefore thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city of which you say, `It is given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, by famine, and by pestilence':</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.37'>Behold, I will gather them from all the countries to which I drove them in my anger and my wrath and in great indignation; I will bring them back to this place, and I will make them dwell in safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.38'>And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.39'>I will give them one heart and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for their own good and the good of their children after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.32.40'>I will make with them an everlasting covenant, that I will not turn away from doing good to them; and I will put the fear of me in their hearts, that they may not turn from me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.33.8'>I will cleanse them from all the guilt of their sin against me, and I will forgive all the guilt of their sin and rebellion against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.9'>And this city shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory before all the nations of the earth who shall hear of all the good that I do for them; they shall fear and tremble because of all the good and all the prosperity I provide for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.33.10'>"Thus says the LORD: In this place of which you say, `It is a waste without man or beast,' in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man or inhabitant or beast, there shall be heard again</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.36.12'>he went down to the king's house, into the secretary's chamber; and all the princes were sitting there: Eli'shama the secretary, Delai'ah the son of Shemai'ah, Elna'than the son of Achbor, Gemari'ah the son of Shaphan, Zedeki'ah the son of Hanani'ah, and all the princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.13'>And Micai'ah told them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the scroll in the hearing of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.14'>Then all the princes sent Jehu'di the son of Nethani'ah, son of Shelemi'ah, son of Cushi, to say to Baruch, "Take in your hand the scroll that you read in the hearing of the people, and come." So Baruch the son of Neri'ah took the scroll in his hand and came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.15'>And they said to him, "Sit down and read it." So Baruch read it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.16'>When they heard all the words, they turned one to another in fear; and they said to Baruch, "We must report all these words to the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.17'>Then they asked Baruch, "Tell us, how did you write all these words? Was it at his dictation?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.18'>Baruch answered them, "He dictated all these words to me, while I wrote them with ink on the scroll."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.19'>Then the princes said to Baruch, "Go and hide, you and Jeremiah, and let no one know where you are."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.20'>So they went into the court to the king, having put the scroll in the chamber of Eli'shama the secretary; and they reported all the words to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.21'>Then the king sent Jehu'di to get the scroll, and he took it from the chamber of Eli'shama the secretary; and Jehu'di read it to the king and all the princes who stood beside the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.22'>It was the ninth month, and the king was sitting in the winter house and there was a fire burning in the brazier before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.23'>As Jehu'di read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a penknife and throw them into the fire in the brazier, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the brazier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.24'>Yet neither the king, nor any of his servants who heard all these words, was afraid, nor did they rend their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.25'>Even when Elna'than and Delai'ah and Gemari'ah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.26'>And the king commanded Jerah'meel the king's son and Serai'ah the son of Az'ri-el and Shelemi'ah the son of Abdeel to seize Baruch the secretary and Jeremiah the prophet, but the LORD hid them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.27'>Now, after the king had burned the scroll with the words which Baruch wrote at Jeremiah's dictation, the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.28'>"Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first scroll, which Jehoi'akim the king of Judah has burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.29'>And concerning Jehoi'akim king of Judah you shall say, `Thus says the LORD, You have burned this scroll, saying, "Why have you written in it that the king of Babylon will certainly come and destroy this land, and will cut off from it man and beast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.30'>Therefore thus says the LORD concerning Jehoi'akim king of Judah, He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David, and his dead body shall be cast out to the heat by day and the frost by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.31'>And I will punish him and his offspring and his servants for their iniquity; I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them, but they would not hear.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.36.32'>Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neri'ah, who wrote on it at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the scroll which Jehoi'akim king of Judah had burned in the fire; and many similar words were added to them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.37.4'>Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people, for he had not yet been put in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.5'>The army of Pharaoh had come out of Egypt; and when the Chalde'ans who were besieging Jerusalem heard news of them, they withdrew from Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.37.10'>For even if you should defeat the whole army of Chalde'ans who are fighting against you, and there remained of them only wounded men, every man in his tent, they would rise up and burn this city with fire.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.11'>Now when the Chalde'an army had withdrawn from Jerusalem at the approach of Pharaoh's army,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.12'>Jeremiah set out from Jerusalem to go to the land of Benjamin to receive his portion there among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.13'>When he was at the Benjamin Gate, a sentry there named Iri'jah the son of Shelemi'ah, son of Hanani'ah, seized Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "You are deserting to the Chalde'ans."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.14'>And Jeremiah said, "It is false; I am not deserting to the Chalde'ans." But Iri'jah would not listen to him, and seized Jeremiah and brought him to the princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.15'>And the princes were enraged at Jeremiah, and they beat him and imprisoned him in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for it had been made a prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.16'>When Jeremiah had come to the dungeon cells, and remained there many days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.17'>King Zedeki'ah sent for him, and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house, and said, "Is there any word from the LORD?" Jeremiah said, "There is." Then he said, "You shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.18'>Jeremiah also said to King Zedeki'ah, "What wrong have I done to you or your servants or this people, that you have put me in prison?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.37.19'>Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, `The king of Babylon will not come against you and against this land'?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.37.21'>So King Zedeki'ah gave orders, and they committed Jeremiah to the court of the guard; and a loaf of bread was given him daily from the bakers' street, until all the bread of the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.38.4'>Then the princes said to the king, "Let this man be put to death, for he is weakening the hands of the soldiers who are left in this city, and the hands of all the people, by speaking such words to them. For this man is not seeking the welfare of this people, but their harm."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.5'>King Zedeki'ah said, "Behold, he is in your hands; for the king can do nothing against you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.6'>So they took Jeremiah and cast him into the cistern of Malchi'ah, the king's son, which was in the court of the guard, letting Jeremiah down by ropes. And there was no water in the cistern, but only mire, and Jeremiah sank in the mire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.38.7'>When E'bed-mel'ech the Ethiopian, a eunuch, who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah into the cistern--the king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate--</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>Zedeki'ah was twenty-one years old when he became king; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamu'tal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>And he did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, according to all that Jehoi'akim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>Surely because of the anger of the LORD things came to such a pass in Jerusalem and Judah that he cast them out from his presence.  And Zedeki'ah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>And in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day of the month, Nebuchadrez'zar king of Babylon came with all his army against Jerusalem, and they laid siege to it and built siegeworks against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>So the city was besieged till the eleventh year of King Zedeki'ah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>On the ninth day of the fourth month the famine was so severe in the city, that there was no food for the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>Then a breach was made in the city; and all the men of war fled and went out from the city by night by the way of a gate between the two walls, by the king's garden, while the Chalde'ans were round about the city. And they went in the direction of the Arabah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>But the army of the Chalde'ans pursued the king, and overtook Zedeki'ah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>Then they captured the king, and brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed sentence upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>The king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedeki'ah before his eyes, and also slew all the princes of Judah at Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>He put out the eyes of Zedeki'ah, and bound him in fetters, and the king of Babylon took him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month--which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadrez'zar, king of Babylon--Nebu'zarad'an the captain of the bodyguard who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>And he burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house and all the houses of Jerusalem; every great house he burned down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>And all the army of the Chalde'ans, who were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls round about Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>And Nebu'zarad'an the captain of the guard carried away captive some of the poorest of the people and the rest of the people who were left in the city and the deserters who had deserted to the king of Babylon, together with the rest of the artisans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But Nebu'zarad'an the captain of the guard left some of the poorest of the land to be vinedressers and plowmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>And the pillars of bronze that were in the house of the LORD, and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the house of the LORD, the Chalde'ans broke in pieces, and carried all the bronze to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>And they took away the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the basins, and the dishes for incense, and all the vessels of bronze used in the temple service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>also the small bowls, and the firepans, and the basins, and the pots, and the lampstands, and the dishes for incense, and the bowls for libation. What was of gold the captain of the guard took away as gold, and what was of silver, as silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>As for the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze bulls which were under the sea, and the stands, which Solomon the king had made for the house of the LORD, the bronze of all these things was beyond weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>As for the pillars, the height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, its circumference was twelve cubits, and its thickness was four fingers, and it was hollow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>Upon it was a capital of bronze; the height of the one capital was five cubits; a network and pomegranates, all of bronze, were upon the capital round about. And the second pillar had the like, with pomegranates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>There were ninety-six pomegranates on the sides; all the pomegranates were a hundred upon the network round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>And the captain of the guard took Serai'ah the chief priest, and Zephani'ah the second priest, and the three keepers of the threshold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>and from the city he took an officer who had been in command of the men of war, and seven men of the king's council, who were found in the city; and the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in the midst of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>And Nebu'zarad'an the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried captive out of its land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>This is the number of the people whom Nebuchadrez'zar carried away captive: in the seventh year, three thousand and twenty-three Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrez'zar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrez'zar, Nebu'zarad'an the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty-five persons; all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>And in the thirty-seventh year of the captivity of Jehoi'achin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on the twenty-fifth day of the month, E'vil-mer'odach king of Babylon, in the year that he became king, lifted up the head of Jehoi'achin king of Judah and brought him out of prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were with him in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>So Jehoi'achin put off his prison garments. And every day of his life he dined regularly at the king's table;</verse>
