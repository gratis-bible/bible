But he did not tell his father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gib'e-ah under the pomegranate tree which is at Migron; the people who were with him were about six hundred men,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>and Ahi'jah the son of Ahi'tub, Ich'abod's brother, son of Phin'ehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh, wearing an ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>In the pass, by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>The one crag rose on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, "Come, let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised; it may be that the LORD will work for us; for nothing can hinder the LORD from saving by many or by few."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And his armor-bearer said to him, "Do all that your mind inclines to; behold, I am with you, as is your mind so is mine."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then said Jonathan, "Behold, we will cross over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>If they say to us, `Wait until we come to you,' then we will stand still in our place, and we will not go up to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if they say, `Come up to us,' then we will go up; for the LORD has given them into our hand. And this shall be the sign to us."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So both of them showed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines; and the Philistines said, "Look, Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hid themselves."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the men of the garrison hailed Jonathan and his armor-bearer, and said, "Come up to us, and we will show you a thing." And Jonathan said to his armor-bearer, "Come up after me; for the LORD has given them into the hand of Israel."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, and his armor-bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor-bearer killed them after him;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>and that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor-bearer made, was of about twenty men within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And there was a panic in the camp, in the field, and among all the people; the garrison and even the raiders trembled; the earth quaked; and it became a very great panic.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the watchmen of Saul in Gib'e-ah of Benjamin looked; and behold, the multitude was surging hither and thither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then Saul said to the people who were with him, "Number and see who has gone from us." And when they had numbered, behold, Jonathan and his armor-bearer were not there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Saul said to Ahi'jah, "Bring hither the ark of God." For the ark of God went at that time with the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And while Saul was talking to the priest, the tumult in the camp of the Philistines increased more and more; and Saul said to the priest, "Withdraw your hand."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and behold, every man's sword was against his fellow, and there was very great confusion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now the Hebrews who had been with the Philistines before that time and who had gone up with them into the camp, even they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Likewise, when all the men of Israel who had hid themselves in the hill country of E'phraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, they too followed hard after them in the battle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the LORD delivered Israel that day; and the battle passed beyond Beth-a'ven.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the men of Israel were distressed that day; for Saul laid an oath on the people, saying, "Cursed be the man who eats food until it is evening and I am avenged on my enemies." So none of the people tasted food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And all the people came into the forest; and there was honey on the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And when the people entered the forest, behold, the honey was dropping, but no man put his hand to his mouth; for the people feared the oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But Jonathan had not heard his father charge the people with the oath; so he put forth the tip of the staff that was in his hand, and dipped it in the honeycomb, and put his hand to his mouth; and his eyes became bright.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then one of the people said, "Your father strictly charged the people with an oath, saying, `Cursed be the man who eats food this day.'" And the people were faint.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Then Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land; see how my eyes have become bright, because I tasted a little of this honey.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>How much better if the people had eaten freely today of the spoil of their enemies which they found; for now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>They struck down the Philistines that day from Michmash to Ai'jalon. And the people were very faint;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep and oxen and calves, and slew them on the ground; and the people ate them with the blood.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Then they told Saul, "Behold, the people are sinning against the LORD, by eating with the blood." And he said, "You have dealt treacherously; roll a great stone to me here."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the people, and say to them, `Let every man bring his ox or his sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating with the blood.'" So every one of the people brought his ox with him that night, and slew them there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Then Saul said, "Let us go down after the Philistines by night and despoil them until the morning light; let us not leave a man of them." And they said, "Do whatever seems good to you." But the priest said, "Let us draw near hither to God."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines? Wilt thou give them into the hand of Israel?" But he did not answer him that day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>And Saul said, "Come hither, all you leaders of the people; and know and see how this sin has arisen today.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>For as the LORD lives who saves Israel, though it be in Jonathan my son, he shall surely die." But there was not a man among all the people that answered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>Then he said to all Israel, "You shall be on one side, and I and Jonathan my son will be on the other side." And the people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>Therefore Saul said, "O LORD God of Israel, why hast thou not answered thy servant this day? If this guilt is in me or in Jonathan my son, O LORD, God of Israel, give Urim; but if this guilt is in thy people Israel, give Thummim." And Jonathan and Saul were taken, but the people escaped.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="42">42</a>Then Saul said, "Cast the lot between me and my son Jonathan." And Jonathan was taken.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="43">43</a>Then Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you have done." And Jonathan told him, "I tasted a little honey with the tip of the staff that was in my hand; here I am, I will die."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="44">44</a>And Saul said, "God do so to me and more also; you shall surely die, Jonathan."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="45">45</a>Then the people said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who has wrought this great victory in Israel? Far from it! As the LORD lives, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the ground; for he has wrought with God this day." So the people ransomed Jonathan, that he did not die.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="46">46</a>Then Saul went up from pursuing the Philistines; and the Philistines went to their own place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="47">47</a>When Saul had taken the kingship over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side, against Moab, against the Ammonites, against Edom, against the kings of Zobah, and against the Philistines; wherever he turned he put them to the worse.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="48">48</a>And he did valiantly, and smote the Amal'ekites, and delivered Israel out of the hands of those who plundered them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="49">49</a>Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Mal'chishu'a; and the names of his two daughters were these: the name of the first-born was Merab, and the name of the younger Michal;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="50">50</a>and the name of Saul's wife was Ahin'o-am the daughter of Ahim'a-az. And the name of the commander of his army was Abner the son of Ner, Saul's uncle;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="51">51</a>Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abi'el.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="52">52</a>There was hard fighting against the Philistines all the days of Saul; and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he attached him to himself.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
