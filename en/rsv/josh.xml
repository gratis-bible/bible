        <title>Happy are you, O Israel! Who is like you, a people saved by the LORD, the shield of your help, and the sword of your triumph! Your enemies shall come fawning to you; and you shall tread upon their high places."</title>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>After the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, the LORD said to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>"Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them, to the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you, as I promised to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphra'tes, all the land of the Hittites to the Great Sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life; as I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of good courage; for you shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded you; turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night, that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it; for then you shall make your way prosperous, and then you shall have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have I not commanded you? Be strong and of good courage; be not frightened, neither be dismayed; for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>"Pass through the camp, and command the people, `Prepare your provisions; for within three days you are to pass over this Jordan, to go in to take possession of the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manas'seh Joshua said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>"Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, `The LORD your God is providing you a place of rest, and will give you this land.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle shall remain in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan; but all the men of valor among you shall pass over armed before your brethren and shall help them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>until the LORD gives rest to your brethren as well as to you, and they also take possession of the land which the LORD your God is giving them; then you shall return to the land of your possession, and shall possess it, the land which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, "All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so we will obey you; only may the LORD your God be with you, as he was with Moses!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Whoever rebels against your commandment and disobeys your words, whatever you command him, shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent two men secretly from Shittim as spies, saying, "Go, view the land, especially Jericho." And they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, "Behold, certain men of Israel have come here tonight to search out the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, "Bring forth the men that have come to you, who entered your house; for they have come to search out all the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them; and she said, "True, men came to me, but I did not know where they came from;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>and when the gate was to be closed, at dark, the men went out; where the men went I do not know; pursue them quickly, for you will overtake them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>So the men pursued after them on the way to the Jordan as far as the fords; and as soon as the pursuers had gone out, the gate was shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>Before they lay down, she came up to them on the roof,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>and said to the men, "I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted, and there was no courage left in any man, because of you; for the LORD your God is he who is God in heaven above and on earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now then, swear to me by the LORD that as I have dealt kindly with you, you also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a sure sign,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>and save alive my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all who belong to them, and deliver our lives from death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men said to her, "Our life for yours! If you do not tell this business of ours, then we will deal kindly and faithfully with you when the LORD gives us the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she dwelt in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said to them, "Go into the hills, lest the pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers have returned; then afterward you may go your way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>The men said to her, "We will be guiltless with respect to this oath of yours which you have made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, you shall bind this scarlet cord in the window through which you let us down; and you shall gather into your house your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>If any one goes out of the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless; but if a hand is laid upon any one who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>But if you tell this business of ours, then we shall be guiltless with respect to your oath which you have made us swear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, "According to your words, so be it." Then she sent them away, and they departed; and she bound the scarlet cord in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>They departed, and went into the hills, and remained there three days, until the pursuers returned; for the pursuers had made search all along the way and found nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>Then the two men came down again from the hills, and passed over and came to Joshua the son of Nun; and they told him all that had befallen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said to Joshua, "Truly the LORD has given all the land into our hands; and moreover all the inhabitants of the land are fainthearted because of us."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>Early in the morning Joshua rose and set out from Shittim, with all the people of Israel; and they came to the Jordan, and lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>At the end of three days the officers went through the camp</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>and commanded the people, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from your place and follow it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>that you may know the way you shall go, for you have not passed this way before. Yet there shall be a space between you and it, a distance of about two thousand cubits; do not come near it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said to the people, "Sanctify yourselves; for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders among you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua said to the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass on before the people." And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And the LORD said to Joshua, "This day I will begin to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And you shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, `When you come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said to the people of Israel, "Come hither, and hear the words of the LORD your God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, "Hereby you shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Per'izzites, the Gir'gashites, the Amorites, and the Jeb'usites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is to pass over before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore take twelve men from the tribes of Israel, from each tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan shall be stopped from flowing, and the waters coming down from above shall stand in one heap."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>So, when the people set out from their tents, to pass over the Jordan with the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>and when those who bore the ark had come to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests bearing the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (the Jordan overflows all its banks throughout the time of harvest),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>the waters coming down from above stood and rose up in a heap far off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zar'ethan, and those flowing down toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off; and the people passed over opposite Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And while all Israel were passing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, until all the nation finished passing over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>When all the nation had finished passing over the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>"Take twelve men from the people, from each tribe a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>and command them, `Take twelve stones from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests' feet stood, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the place where you lodge tonight.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men from the people of Israel, whom he had appointed, a man from each tribe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>and Joshua said to them, "Pass on before the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take up each of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>that this may be a sign among you, when your children ask in time to come, `What do those stones mean to you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then you shall tell them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall be to the people of Israel a memorial for ever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the men of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the people of Israel, as the LORD told Joshua; and they carried them over with them to the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests bearing the ark of the covenant had stood; and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded Joshua to tell the people, according to all that Moses had commanded Joshua.  The people passed over in haste;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>and when all the people had finished passing over, the ark of the LORD and the priests passed over before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manas'seh passed over armed before the people of Israel, as Moses had bidden them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>about forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before the LORD for battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day the LORD exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; and they stood in awe of him, as they had stood in awe of Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And the LORD said to Joshua,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>"Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony to come up out of the Jordan."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, "Come up out of the Jordan."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And when the priests bearing the ark of the covenant of the LORD came up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up on dry ground, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and overflowed all its banks, as before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>The people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and they encamped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he said to the people of Israel, "When your children ask their fathers in time to come, `What do these stones mean?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>then you shall let your children know, `Israel passed over this Jordan on dry ground.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you passed over, as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up for us until we passed over,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the LORD is mighty; that you may fear the LORD your God for ever."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>When all the kings of the Amorites that were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites that were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan for the people of Israel until they had crossed over, their heart melted, and there was no longer any spirit in them, because of the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time the LORD said to Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise the people of Israel again the second time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>So Joshua made flint knives, and circumcised the people of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the males of the people who came out of Egypt, all the men of war, had died on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>Though all the people who came out had been circumcised, yet all the people that were born on the way in the wilderness after they had come out of Egypt had not been circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the people of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness, till all the nation, the men of war that came forth out of Egypt, perished, because they did not hearken to the voice of the LORD; to them the LORD swore that he would not let them see the land which the LORD had sworn to their fathers to give us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>So it was their children, whom he raised up in their stead, that Joshua circumcised; for they were uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>When the circumcising of all the nation was done, they remained in their places in the camp till they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And the LORD said to Joshua, "This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from you." And so the name of that place is called Gilgal to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>While the people of Israel were encamped in Gilgal they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And on the morrow after the passover, on that very day, they ate of the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they ate of the produce of the land; and the people of Israel had manna no more, but ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>When Joshua was by Jericho, he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man stood before him with his drawn sword in his hand; and Joshua went to him and said to him, "Are you for us, or for our adversaries?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he said, "No; but as commander of the army of the LORD I have now come." And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, "What does my lord bid his servant?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the commander of the LORD's army said to Joshua, "Put off your shoes from your feet; for the place where you stand is holy." And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was shut up from within and from without because of the people of Israel; none went out, and none came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And the LORD said to Joshua, "See, I have given into your hand Jericho, with its king and mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>You shall march around the city, all the men of war going around the city once. Thus shall you do for six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark; and on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, the priests blowing the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then all the people shall shout with a great shout; and the wall of the city will fall down flat, and the people shall go up every man straight before him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>So Joshua the son of Nun called the priests and said to them, "Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And he said to the people, "Go forward; march around the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And as Joshua had commanded the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the LORD went forward, blowing the trumpets, with the ark of the covenant of the LORD following them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the trumpets blew continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>But Joshua commanded the people, "You shall not shout or let your voice be heard, neither shall any word go out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout; then you shall shout."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So he caused the ark of the LORD to compass the city, going about it once; and they came into the camp, and spent the night in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>Then Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD passed on, blowing the trumpets continually; and the armed men went before them, and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while the trumpets blew continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And the second day they marched around the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did for six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>On the seventh day they rose early at the dawn of day, and marched around the city in the same manner seven times: it was only on that day that they marched around the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And at the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, "Shout; for the LORD has given you the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And the city and all that is within it shall be devoted to the LORD for destruction; only Rahab the harlot and all who are with her in her house shall live, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>But you, keep yourselves from the things devoted to destruction, lest when you have devoted them you take any of the devoted things and make the camp of Israel a thing for destruction, and bring trouble upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>But all silver and gold, and vessels of bronze and iron, are sacred to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted, and the trumpets were blown. As soon as the people heard the sound of the trumpet, the people raised a great shout, and the wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city, every man straight before him, and they took the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>Then they utterly destroyed all in the city, both men and women, young and old, oxen, sheep, and asses, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>And Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, "Go into the harlot's house, and bring out from it the woman, and all who belong to her, as you swore to her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>So the young men who had been spies went in, and brought out Rahab, and her father and mother and brothers and all who belonged to her; and they brought all her kindred, and set them outside the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>And they burned the city with fire, and all within it; only the silver and gold, and the vessels of bronze and of iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>But Rahab the harlot, and her father's household, and all who belonged to her, Joshua saved alive; and she dwelt in Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>Joshua laid an oath upon them at that time, saying, "Cursed before the LORD be the man that rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho.  At the cost of his first-born shall he lay its foundation, and at the cost of his youngest son shall he set up its gates."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.27'>So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was in all the land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>But the people of Israel broke faith in regard to the devoted things; for Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took some of the devoted things; and the anger of the LORD burned against the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-a'ven, east of Bethel, and said to them, "Go up and spy out the land." And the men went up and spied out Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>And they returned to Joshua, and said to him, "Let not all the people go up, but let about two or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; do not make the whole people toil up there, for they are but few."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>So about three thousand went up there from the people; and they fled before the men of Ai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>and the men of Ai killed about thirty-six men of them, and chased them before the gate as far as Sheb'arim, and slew them at the descent. And the hearts of the people melted, and became as water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>Then Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his face before the ark of the LORD until the evening, he and the elders of Israel; and they put dust upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>And Joshua said, "Alas, O Lord GOD, why hast thou brought this people over the Jordan at all, to give us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us? Would that we had been content to dwell beyond the Jordan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>O Lord, what can I say, when Israel has turned their backs before their enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of it, and will surround us, and cut off our name from the earth; and what wilt thou do for thy great name?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>The LORD said to Joshua, "Arise, why have you thus fallen upon your face?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>Israel has sinned; they have transgressed my covenant which I commanded them; they have taken some of the devoted things; they have stolen, and lied, and put them among their own stuff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>Therefore the people of Israel cannot stand before their enemies; they turn their backs before their enemies, because they have become a thing for destruction. I will be with you no more, unless you destroy the devoted things from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>Up, sanctify the people, and say, `Sanctify yourselves for tomorrow; for thus says the LORD, God of Israel, "There are devoted things in the midst of you, O Israel; you cannot stand before your enemies, until you take away the devoted things from among you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.14'>In the morning therefore you shall be brought near by your tribes; and the tribe which the LORD takes shall come near by families; and the family which the LORD takes shall come near by households; and the household which the LORD takes shall come near man by man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.15'>And he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done a shameful thing in Israel.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.16'>So Joshua rose early in the morning, and brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.17'>and he brought near the families of Judah, and the family of the Zer'ahites was taken; and he brought near the family of the Zer'ahites man by man, and Zabdi was taken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.18'>and he brought near his household man by man, and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.19'>Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD God of Israel, and render praise to him; and tell me now what you have done; do not hide it from me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>And Achan answered Joshua, "Of a truth I have sinned against the LORD God of Israel, and this is what I did:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>when I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle from Shinar, and two hundred shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, then I coveted them, and took them; and behold, they are hidden in the earth inside my tent, with the silver underneath."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and behold, it was hidden in his tent with the silver underneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>And they took them out of the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the people of Israel; and they laid them down before the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.24'>And Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the silver and the mantle and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters, and his oxen and asses and sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>And Joshua said, "Why did you bring trouble on us? The LORD brings trouble on you today." And all Israel stoned him with stones; they burned them with fire, and stoned them with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.26'>And they raised over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day; then the LORD turned from his burning anger. Therefore to this day the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.1'>And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear or be dismayed; take all the fighting men with you, and arise, go up to Ai; see, I have given into your hand the king of Ai, and his people, his city, and his land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.2'>and you shall do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king; only its spoil and its cattle you shall take as booty for yourselves; lay an ambush against the city, behind it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the fighting men, to go up to Ai; and Joshua chose thirty thousand mighty men of valor, and sent them forth by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>And he commanded them, "Behold, you shall lie in ambush against the city, behind it; do not go very far from the city, but hold yourselves all in readiness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.5'>and I, and all the people who are with me, will approach the city. And when they come out against us, as before, we shall flee before them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.6'>and they will come out after us, till we have drawn them away from the city; for they will say, `They are fleeing from us, as before.' So we will flee from them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.7'>then you shall rise up from the ambush, and seize the city; for the LORD your God will give it into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.8'>And when you have taken the city, you shall set the city on fire, doing as the LORD has bidden; see, I have commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.9'>So Joshua sent them forth; and they went to the place of ambush, and lay between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.10'>And Joshua arose early in the morning and mustered the people, and went up, with the elders of Israel, before the people to Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.11'>And all the fighting men who were with him went up, and drew near before the city, and encamped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.12'>And he took about five thousand men, and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.13'>So they stationed the forces, the main encampment which was north of the city and its rear guard west of the city. But Joshua spent that night in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.14'>And when the king of Ai saw this he and all his people, the men of the city, made haste and went out early to the descent toward the Arabah to meet Israel in battle; but he did not know that there was an ambush against him behind the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>And Joshua and all Israel made a pretense of being beaten before them, and fled in the direction of the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>So all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and as they pursued Joshua they were drawn away from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.17'>There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, who did not go out after Israel; they left the city open, and pursued Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.18'>Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Stretch out the javelin that is in your hand toward Ai; for I will give it into your hand." And Joshua stretched out the javelin that was in his hand toward the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.19'>And the ambush rose quickly out of their place, and as soon as he had stretched out his hand, they ran and entered the city and took it; and they made haste to set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.20'>So when the men of Ai looked back, behold, the smoke of the city went up to heaven; and they had no power to flee this way or that, for the people that fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.21'>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken the city, and that the smoke of the city went up, then they turned back and smote the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.22'>And the others came forth from the city against them; so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side; and Israel smote them, until there was left none that survived or escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.23'>But the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.24'>When Israel had finished slaughtering all the inhabitants of Ai in the open wilderness where they pursued them and all of them to the very last had fallen by the edge of the sword, all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.25'>And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.26'>For Joshua did not draw back his hand, with which he stretched out the javelin, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.27'>Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took as their booty, according to the word of the LORD which he commanded Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.28'>So Joshua burned Ai, and made it for ever a heap of ruins, as it is to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.29'>And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until evening; and at the going down of the sun Joshua commanded, and they took his body down from the tree, and cast it at the entrance of the gate of the city, and raised over it a great heap of stones, which stands there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.30'>Then Joshua built an altar in Mount Ebal to the LORD, the God of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.31'>as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the people of Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, "an altar of unhewn stones, upon which no man has lifted an iron tool"; and they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.32'>And there, in the presence of the people of Israel, he wrote upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses, which he had written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.33'>And all Israel, sojourner as well as homeborn, with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, half of them in front of Mount Ger'izim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at the first, that they should bless the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.34'>And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.35'>There was not a word of all that Moses commanded which Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.9'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.1'>When all the kings who were beyond the Jordan in the hill country and in the lowland all along the coast of the Great Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Per'izzites, the Hivites, and the Jeb'usites, heard of this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.2'>they gathered together with one accord to fight Joshua and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.3'>But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.4'>they on their part acted with cunning, and went and made ready provisions, and took worn-out sacks upon their asses, and wineskins, worn-out and torn and mended,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.5'>with worn-out, patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes; and all their provisions were dry and moldy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.6'>And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal, and said to him and to the men of Israel, "We have come from a far country; so now make a covenant with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.7'>But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, "Perhaps you live among us; then how can we make a covenant with you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.8'>They said to Joshua, "We are your servants." And Joshua said to them, "Who are you? And where do you come from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.9'>They said to him, "From a very far country your servants have come, because of the name of the LORD your God; for we have heard a report of him, and all that he did in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.10'>and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ash'taroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.11'>And our elders and all the inhabitants of our country said to us, `Take provisions in your hand for the journey, and go to meet them, and say to them, "We are your servants; come now, make a covenant with us."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.12'>Here is our bread; it was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for the journey, on the day we set forth to come to you, but now, behold, it is dry and moldy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.13'>these wineskins were new when we filled them, and behold, they are burst; and these garments and shoes of ours are worn out from the very long journey."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.14'>So the men partook of their provisions, and did not ask direction from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.15'>And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation swore to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.16'>At the end of three days after they had made a covenant with them, they heard that they were their neighbors, and that they dwelt among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.17'>And the people of Israel set out and reached their cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, Chephi'rah, Be-er'oth, and Kir'iath-je'arim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.18'>But the people of Israel did not kill them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel. Then all the congregation murmured against the leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.19'>But all the leaders said to all the congregation, "We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, and now we may not touch them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.20'>This we will do to them, and let them live, lest wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we swore to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.21'>And the leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all the congregation, as the leaders had said of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.22'>Joshua summoned them, and he said to them, "Why did you deceive us, saying, `We are very far from you,' when you dwell among us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.23'>Now therefore you are cursed, and some of you shall always be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.24'>They answered Joshua, "Because it was told to your servants for a certainty that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the inhabitants of the land from before you; so we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and did this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.25'>And now, behold, we are in your hand: do as it seems good and right in your sight to do to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.26'>So he did to them, and delivered them out of the hand of the people of Israel; and they did not kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.27'>But Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to continue to this day, in the place which he should choose.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.10'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.1'>When Ado'ni-ze'dek king of Jerusalem heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it, doing to Ai and its king as he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were among them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>he feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>So Ado'ni-ze'dek king of Jerusalem sent to Hoham king of Hebron, to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhi'a king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.4'>"Come up to me, and help me, and let us smite Gibeon; for it has made peace with Joshua and with the people of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered their forces, and went up with all their armies and encamped against Gibeon, and made war against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.6'>And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, "Do not relax your hand from your servants; come up to us quickly, and save us, and help us; for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill country are gathered against us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.7'>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.8'>And the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands; there shall not a man of them stand before you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.9'>So Joshua came upon them suddenly, having marched up all night from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.10'>And the LORD threw them into a panic before Israel, who slew them with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them by the way of the ascent of Beth-hor'on, and smote them as far as Aze'kah and Makke'dah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.11'>And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth-hor'on, the LORD threw down great stones from heaven upon them as far as Aze'kah, and they died; there were more who died because of the hailstones than the men of Israel killed with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.12'>Then spoke Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD gave the Amorites over to the men of Israel; and he said in the sight of Israel,  "Sun, stand thou still at Gibeon, and thou Moon in the valley of Ai'jalon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.13'>And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies. Is this not written in the Book of Jashar? The sun stayed in the midst of heaven, and did not hasten to go down for about a whole day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.14'>There has been no day like it before or since, when the LORD hearkened to the voice of a man; for the LORD fought for Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.16'>These five kings fled, and hid themselves in the cave at Makke'dah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.17'>And it was told Joshua, "The five kings have been found, hidden in the cave at Makke'dah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.18'>And Joshua said, "Roll great stones against the mouth of the cave, and set men by it to guard them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.21'>all the people returned safe to Joshua in the camp at Makke'dah; not a man moved his tongue against any of the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.22'>Then Joshua said, "Open the mouth of the cave, and bring those five kings out to me from the cave."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.23'>And they did so, and brought those five kings out to him from the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.24'>And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel, and said to the chiefs of the men of war who had gone with him, "Come near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings." Then they came near, and put their feet on their necks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.25'>And Joshua said to them, "Do not be afraid or dismayed; be strong and of good courage; for thus the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you fight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.26'>And afterward Joshua smote them and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees. And they hung upon the trees until evening;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.27'>but at the time of the going down of the sun, Joshua commanded, and they took them down from the trees, and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves, and they set great stones against the mouth of the cave, which remain to this very day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.20.2'>"Say to the people of Israel, `Appoint the cities of refuge, of which I spoke to you through Moses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.20.3'>that the manslayer who kills any person without intent or unwittingly may flee there; they shall be for you a refuge from the avenger of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.20.4'>He shall flee to one of these cities and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city, and explain his case to the elders of that city; then they shall take him into the city, and give him a place, and he shall remain with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.20.5'>And if the avenger of blood pursues him, they shall not give up the slayer into his hand; because he killed his neighbor unwittingly, having had no enmity against him in times past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.20.6'>And he shall remain in that city until he has stood before the congregation for judgment, until the death of him who is high priest at the time: then the slayer may go again to his own town and his own home, to the town from which he fled.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.20.7'>So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naph'tali, and Shechem in the hill country of E'phraim, and Kir'iath-ar'ba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.20.8'>And beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they appointed Bezer in the wilderness on the tableland, from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead, from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan, from the tribe of Manas'seh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.20.9'>These were the cities designated for all the people of Israel, and for the stranger sojourning among them, that any one who killed a person without intent could flee there, so that he might not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, till he stood before the congregation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.21'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.1'>Then the heads of the fathers' houses of the Levites came to Elea'zar the priest and to Joshua the son of Nun and to the heads of the fathers' houses of the tribes of the people of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.2'>and they said to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, "The LORD commanded through Moses that we be given cities to dwell in, along with their pasture lands for our cattle."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.3'>So by command of the LORD the people of Israel gave to the Levites the following cities and pasture lands out of their inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.4'>The lot came out for the families of the Ko'hathites. So those Levites who were descendants of Aaron the priest received by lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin, thirteen cities.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.21.10'>which went to the descendants of Aaron, one of the families of the Ko'hathites who belonged to the Levites; since the lot fell to them first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.11'>They gave them Kir'iath-ar'ba (Arba being the father of Anak), that is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with the pasture lands round about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.21.12'>But the fields of the city and its villages had been given to Caleb the son of Jephun'neh as his possession.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.22'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.1'>Then Joshua summoned the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manas'seh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.2'>and said to them, "You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I have commanded you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.3'>you have not forsaken your brethren these many days, down to this day, but have been careful to keep the charge of the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.4'>And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brethren, as he promised them; therefore turn and go to your home in the land where your possession lies, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.5'>Take good care to observe the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, to love the LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his commandments, and to cleave to him, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.6'>So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away; and they went to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.7'>Now to the one half of the tribe of Manas'seh Moses had given a possession in Bashan; but to the other half Joshua had given a possession beside their brethren in the land west of the Jordan. And when Joshua sent them away to their homes and blessed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.8'>he said to them, "Go back to your homes with much wealth, and with very many cattle, with silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and with much clothing; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.9'>So the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh returned home, parting from the people of Israel at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, their own land of which they had possessed themselves by command of the LORD through Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.10'>And when they came to the region about the Jordan, that lies in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh built there an altar by the Jordan, an altar of great size.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.11'>And the people of Israel heard say, "Behold, the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh have built an altar at the frontier of the land of Canaan, in the region about the Jordan, on the side that belongs to the people of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.12'>And when the people of Israel heard of it, the whole assembly of the people of Israel gathered at Shiloh, to make war against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.13'>Then the people of Israel sent to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manas'seh, in the land of Gilead, Phin'ehas the son of Elea'zar the priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.14'>and with him ten chiefs, one from each of the tribal families of Israel, every one of them the head of a family among the clans of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.15'>And they came to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manas'seh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.16'>"Thus says the whole congregation of the LORD, `What is this treachery which you have committed against the God of Israel in turning away this day from following the LORD, by building yourselves an altar this day in rebellion against the LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.17'>Have we not had enough of the sin at Pe'or from which even yet we have not cleansed ourselves, and for which there came a plague upon the congregation of the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.18'>that you must turn away this day from following the LORD? And if you rebel against the LORD today he will be angry with the whole congregation of Israel tomorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.19'>But now, if your land is unclean, pass over into the LORD's land where the LORD's tabernacle stands, and take for yourselves a possession among us; only do not rebel against the LORD, or make us as rebels by building yourselves an altar other than the altar of the LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.20'>Did not Achan the son of Zerah break faith in the matter of the devoted things, and wrath fell upon all the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish alone for his iniquity.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.21'>Then the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manas'seh said in answer to the heads of the families of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.22'>"The Mighty One, God, the LORD! The Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows; and let Israel itself know! If it was in rebellion or in breach of faith toward the LORD, spare us not today</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.23'>for building an altar to turn away from following the LORD; or if we did so to offer burnt offerings or cereal offerings or peace offerings on it, may the LORD himself take vengeance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.24'>Nay, but we did it from fear that in time to come your children might say to our children, `What have you to do with the LORD, the God of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.25'>For the LORD has made the Jordan a boundary between us and you, you Reubenites and Gadites; you have no portion in the LORD.' So your children might make our children cease to worship the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.26'>Therefore we said, `Let us now build an altar, not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.27'>but to be a witness between us and you, and between the generations after us, that we do perform the service of the LORD in his presence with our burnt offerings and sacrifices and peace offerings; lest your children say to our children in time to come, "You have no portion in the LORD."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.28'>And we thought, If this should be said to us or to our descendants in time to come, we should say, `Behold the copy of the altar of the LORD, which our fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifice, but to be a witness between us and you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.29'>Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn away this day from following the LORD by building an altar for burnt offering, cereal offering, or sacrifice, other than the altar of the LORD our God that stands before his tabernacle!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.30'>When Phin'ehas the priest and the chiefs of the congregation, the heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words that the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manas'sites spoke, it pleased them well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.31'>And Phin'ehas the son of Elea'zar the priest said to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the Manas'sites, "Today we know that the LORD is in the midst of us, because you have not committed this treachery against the LORD; now you have saved the people of Israel from the hand of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.32'>Then Phin'ehas the son of Elea'zar the priest, and the chiefs, returned from the Reubenites and the Gadites in the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the people of Israel, and brought back word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.33'>And the report pleased the people of Israel; and the people of Israel blessed God and spoke no more of making war against them, to destroy the land where the Reubenites and the Gadites were settled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.22.34'>The Reubenites and the Gadites called the altar Witness; "For," said they, "it is a witness between us that the LORD is God."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.23'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.1'>A long time afterward, when the LORD had given rest to Israel from all their enemies round about, and Joshua was old and well advanced in years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.2'>Joshua summoned all Israel, their elders and heads, their judges and officers, and said to them, "I am now old and well advanced in years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.3'>and you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake, for it is the LORD your God who has fought for you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.23.6'>Therefore be very steadfast to keep and do all that is written in the book of the law of Moses, turning aside from it neither to the right hand nor to the left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.7'>that you may not be mixed with these nations left here among you, or make mention of the names of their gods, or swear by them, or serve them, or bow down yourselves to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.8'>but cleave to the LORD your God as you have done to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.9'>For the LORD has driven out before you great and strong nations; and as for you, no man has been able to withstand you to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.10'>One man of you puts to flight a thousand, since it is the LORD your God who fights for you, as he promised you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.11'>Take good heed to yourselves, therefore, to love the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.12'>For if you turn back, and join the remnant of these nations left here among you, and make marriages with them, so that you marry their women and they yours,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.23.14'>"And now I am about to go the way of all the earth, and you know in your hearts and souls, all of you, that not one thing has failed of all the good things which the LORD your God promised concerning you; all have come to pass for you, not one of them has failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.15'>But just as all the good things which the LORD your God promised concerning you have been fulfilled for you, so the LORD will bring upon you all the evil things, until he have destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God has given you,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.24'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.1'>Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and summoned the elders, the heads, the judges, and the officers of Israel; and they presented themselves before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.2'>And Joshua said to all the people, "Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, `Your fathers lived of old beyond the Euphra'tes, Terah, the father of Abraham and of Nahor; and they served other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.3'>Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and made his offspring many. I gave him Isaac;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.4'>and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. And I gave Esau the hill country of Se'ir to possess, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.5'>And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt with what I did in the midst of it; and afterwards I brought you out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.6'>Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.7'>And when they cried to the LORD, he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and made the sea come upon them and cover them; and your eyes saw what I did to Egypt; and you lived in the wilderness a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.8'>Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan; they fought with you, and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land, and I destroyed them before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.9'>Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel; and he sent and invited Balaam the son of Be'or to curse you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.10'>but I would not listen to Balaam; therefore he blessed you; so I delivered you out of his hand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.12'>And I sent the hornet before you, which drove them out before you, the two kings of the Amorites; it was not by your sword or by your bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.13'>I gave you a land on which you had not labored, and cities which you had not built, and you dwell therein; you eat the fruit of vineyards and oliveyards which you did not plant.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.14'>"Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in faithfulness; put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.16'>Then the people answered, "Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.17'>for it is the LORD our God who brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, and who did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.18'>and the LORD drove out before us all the peoples, the Amorites who lived in the land; therefore we also will serve the LORD, for he is our God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.19'>But Joshua said to the people, "You cannot serve the LORD; for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn and do you harm, and consume you, after having done you good."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>And the people said to Joshua, "Nay; but we will serve the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>Then Joshua said to the people, "You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen the LORD, to serve him." And they said, "We are witnesses."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said to Joshua, "The LORD our God we will serve, and his voice we will obey."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made statutes and ordinances for them at Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God; and he took a great stone, and set it up there under the oak in the sanctuary of the LORD.</verse>
