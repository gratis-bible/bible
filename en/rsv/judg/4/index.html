Then Deb'orah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Barak summoned Zeb'ulun and Naph'tali to Kedesh; and ten thousand men went up at his heels; and Deb'orah went up with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Now Heber the Ken'ite had separated from the Ken'ites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Za-anan'nim, which is near Kedesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When Sis'era was told that Barak the son of Abin'o-am had gone up to Mount Tabor,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Sis'era called out all his chariots, nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Haro'sheth-ha-goiim to the river Kishon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And Deb'orah said to Barak, "Up! For this is the day in which the LORD has given Sis'era into your hand. Does not the LORD go out before you?" So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And the LORD routed Sis'era and all his chariots and all his army before Barak at the edge of the sword; and Sis'era alighted from his chariot and fled away on foot.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Haro'sheth-ha-goiim, and all the army of Sis'era fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>But Sis'era fled away on foot to the tent of Ja'el, the wife of Heber the Ken'ite; for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Ken'ite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Ja'el came out to meet Sis'era, and said to him, "Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me; have no fear." So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to her, "Pray, give me a little water to drink; for I am thirsty." So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And he said to her, "Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, `Is any one here?' say, No."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But Ja'el the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple, till it went down into the ground, as he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And behold, as Barak pursued Sis'era, Ja'el went out to meet him, and said to him, "Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking." So he went in to her tent; and there lay Sis'era dead, with the tent peg in his temple.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the hand of the people of Israel bore harder and harder on Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
