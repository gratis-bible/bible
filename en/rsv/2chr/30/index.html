For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away his face from you, if you return to him."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So the couriers went from city to city through the country of E'phraim and Manas'seh, and as far as Zeb'ulun; but they laughed them to scorn, and mocked them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Only a few men of Asher, of Manas'seh, and of Zeb'ulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The hand of God was also upon Judah to give them one heart to do what the king and the princes commanded by the word of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And many people came together in Jerusalem to keep the feast of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great assembly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They set to work and removed the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the altars for burning incense they took away and threw into the Kidron valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And they killed the passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were put to shame, so that they sanctified themselves, and brought burnt offerings into the house of the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>They took their accustomed posts according to the law of Moses the man of God; the priests sprinkled the blood which they received from the hand of the Levites.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For there were many in the assembly who had not sanctified themselves; therefore the Levites had to kill the passover lamb for every one who was not clean, to make it holy to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For a multitude of the people, many of them from E'phraim, Manas'seh, Is'sachar, and Zeb'ulun, had not cleansed themselves, yet they ate the passover otherwise than as prescribed. For Hezeki'ah had prayed for them, saying, "The good LORD pardon every one</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>who sets his heart to seek God, the LORD the God of his fathers, even though not according to the sanctuary's rules of cleanness."</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the LORD heard Hezeki'ah, and healed the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the people of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness; and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day, singing with all their might to the LORD.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Hezeki'ah spoke encouragingly to all the Levites who showed good skill in the service of the LORD. So the people ate the food of the festival for seven days, sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the LORD the God of their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Then the whole assembly agreed together to keep the feast for another seven days; so they kept it for another seven days with gladness.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For Hezeki'ah king of Judah gave the assembly a thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep for offerings, and the princes gave the assembly a thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep. And the priests sanctified themselves in great numbers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The whole assembly of Judah, and the priests and the Levites, and the whole assembly that came out of Israel, and the sojourners who came out of the land of Israel, and the sojourners who dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>So there was great joy in Jerusalem, for since the time of Solomon the son of David king of Israel there had been nothing like this in Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then the priests and the Levites arose and blessed the people, and their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy habitation in heaven.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
