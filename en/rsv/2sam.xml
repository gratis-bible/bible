      <chapter osisID='2Sam.1'>
        <title>in Hebron, for all the places where David and his men had roamed.</title>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.1'>After the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amal'ekites, David remained two days in Ziklag;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.2'>and on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul's camp, with his clothes rent and earth upon his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and did obeisance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.3'>David said to him, "Where do you come from?" And he said to him, "I have escaped from the camp of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.4'>And David said to him, "How did it go? Tell me." And he answered, "The people have fled from the battle, and many of the people also have fallen and are dead; and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.5'>Then David said to the young man who told him, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.6'>And the young man who told him said, "By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilbo'a; and there was Saul leaning upon his spear; and lo, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.7'>And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, `Here I am.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.8'>And he said to me, `Who are you?' I answered him, `I am an Amal'ekite.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.9'>And he said to me, `Stand beside me and slay me; for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.10'>So I stood beside him, and slew him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen; and I took the crown which was on his head and the armlet which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.11'>Then David took hold of his clothes, and rent them; and so did all the men who were with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.12'>and they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.13'>And David said to the young man who told him, "Where do you come from?" And he answered, "I am the son of a sojourner, an Amal'ekite."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.14'>David said to him, "How is it you were not afraid to put forth your hand to destroy the LORD'S anointed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.15'>Then David called one of the young men and said, "Go, fall upon him." And he smote him so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.16'>And David said to him, "Your blood be upon your head; for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, `I have slain the LORD'S anointed.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.17'>And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.18'>and he said it should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar. He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.19'>"Thy glory, O Israel, is slain upon thy high places! How are the mighty fallen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.20'>Tell it not in Gath, publish it not in the streets of Ash'kelon; lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.21'>"Ye mountains of Gilbo'a, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor upsurging of the deep! For there the shield of the mighty was defiled, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.22'>"From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan turned not back, and the sword of Saul returned not empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.23'>"Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely! In life and in death they were not divided; they were swifter than eagles, they were stronger than lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.24'>"Ye daughters of Israel, weep over Saul, who clothed you daintily in scarlet, who put ornaments of gold upon your apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.25'>"How are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle!  "Jonathan lies slain upon thy high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.26'>I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan; very pleasant have you been to me; your love to me was wonderful, passing the love of women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.1.27'>"How are the mighty fallen, and the weapons of war perished!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.1'>After this David inquired of the LORD, "Shall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?" And the LORD said to him, "Go up." David said, "To which shall I go up?" And he said, "To Hebron."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.2'>So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahin'o-am of Jezreel, and Ab'igail the widow of Nabal of Carmel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.3'>And David brought up his men who were with him, every one with his household; and they dwelt in the towns of Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.4'>And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.  When they told David, "It was the men of Ja'besh-gil'ead who buried Saul,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.5'>David sent messengers to the men of Ja'besh-gil'ead, and said to them, "May you be blessed by the LORD, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord, and buried him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.6'>Now may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you! And I will do good to you because you have done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.7'>Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant; for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.8'>Now Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, had taken Ish-bo'sheth the son of Saul, and brought him over to Mahana'im;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.9'>and he made him king over Gilead and the Ash'urites and Jezreel and E'phraim and Benjamin and all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.10'>Ish-bo'sheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.11'>And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.12'>Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bo'sheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahana'im to Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.13'>And Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah, and the servants of David, went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon; and they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.14'>And Abner said to Jo'ab, "Let the young men arise and play before us." And Jo'ab said, "Let them arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.15'>Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bo'sheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.16'>And each caught his opponent by the head, and thrust his sword in his opponent's side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Hel'kath-hazzu'rim, which is at Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.17'>And the battle was very fierce that day; and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.18'>And the three sons of Zeru'iah were there, Jo'ab, Abi'shai, and As'ahel. Now As'ahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.19'>and As'ahel pursued Abner, and as he went he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.20'>Then Abner looked behind him and said, "Is it you, As'ahel?" And he answered, "It is I."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.21'>Abner said to him, "Turn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men, and take his spoil." But As'ahel would not turn aside from following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.22'>And Abner said again to As'ahel, "Turn aside from following me; why should I smite you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Jo'ab?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.23'>But he refused to turn aside; therefore Abner smote him in the belly with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back; and he fell there, and died where he was. And all who came to the place where As'ahel had fallen and died, stood still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.24'>But Jo'ab and Abi'shai pursued Abner; and as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Gi'ah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.25'>And the Benjaminites gathered themselves together behind Abner, and became one band, and took their stand on the top of a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.26'>Then Abner called to Jo'ab, "Shall the sword devour for ever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you bid your people turn from the pursuit of their brethren?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.27'>And Jo'ab said, "As God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would have given up the pursuit of their brethren in the morning."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.28'>So Jo'ab blew the trumpet; and all the men stopped, and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.29'>And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah; they crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole forenoon they came to Mahana'im.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.30'>Jo'ab returned from the pursuit of Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing of David's servants nineteen men besides As'ahel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.31'>But the servants of David had slain of Benjamin three hundred and sixty of Abner's men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.2.32'>And they took up As'ahel, and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Jo'ab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.1'>There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and weaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.2'>And sons were born to David at Hebron: his first-born was Amnon, of Ahin'o-am of Jezreel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.3'>and his second, Chil'e-ab, of Ab'igail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; and the third, Ab'salom the son of Ma'acah the daughter of Talmai king of Geshur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.4'>and the fourth, Adoni'jah the son of Haggith; and the fifth, Shephati'ah the son of Abi'tal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.5'>and the sixth, Ith're-am, of Eglah, David's wife. These were born to David in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.6'>While there was war between the house of Saul and the house of David, Abner was making himself strong in the house of Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.7'>Now Saul had a concubine, whose name was Rizpah, the daughter of Ai'ah; and Ish-bo'sheth said to Abner, "Why have you gone in to my father's concubine?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.8'>Then Abner was very angry over the words of Ish-bo'sheth, and said, "Am I a dog's head of Judah? This day I keep showing loyalty to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and have not given you into the hand of David; and yet you charge me today with a fault concerning a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.9'>God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not accomplish for David what the LORD has sworn to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.10'>to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and set up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan to Beer-sheba."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.11'>And Ish-bo'sheth could not answer Abner another word, because he feared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.12'>And Abner sent messengers to David at Hebron, saying, "To whom does the land belong? Make your covenant with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring over all Israel to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.13'>And he said, "Good; I will make a covenant with you; but one thing I require of you; that is, you shall not see my face, unless you first bring Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come to see my face."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.14'>Then David sent messengers to Ish-bo'sheth Saul's son, saying, "Give me my wife Michal, whom I betrothed at the price of a hundred foreskins of the Philistines."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.15'>And Ish-bo'sheth sent, and took her from her husband Pal'ti-el the son of La'ish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.16'>But her husband went with her, weeping after her all the way to Bahu'rim. Then Abner said to him, "Go, return"; and he returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.17'>And Abner conferred with the elders of Israel, saying, "For some time past you have been seeking David as king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.18'>Now then bring it about; for the LORD has promised David, saying, `By the hand of my servant David I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines, and from the hand of all their enemies.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.19'>Abner also spoke to Benjamin; and then Abner went to tell David at Hebron all that Israel and the whole house of Benjamin thought good to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.20'>When Abner came with twenty men to David at Hebron, David made a feast for Abner and the men who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.21'>And Abner said to David, "I will arise and go, and will gather all Israel to my lord the king, that they may make a covenant with you, and that you may reign over all that your heart desires." So David sent Abner away; and he went in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.22'>Just then the servants of David arrived with Jo'ab from a raid, bringing much spoil with them. But Abner was not with David at Hebron, for he had sent him away, and he had gone in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.23'>When Jo'ab and all the army that was with him came, it was told Jo'ab, "Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has let him go, and he has gone in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.24'>Then Jo'ab went to the king and said, "What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why is it that you have sent him away, so that he is gone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.25'>You know that Abner the son of Ner came to deceive you, and to know your going out and your coming in, and to know all that you are doing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.26'>When Jo'ab came out from David's presence, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah; but David did not know about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.27'>And when Abner returned to Hebron, Jo'ab took him aside into the midst of the gate to speak with him privately, and there he smote him in the belly, so that he died, for the blood of As'ahel his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.28'>Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, "I and my kingdom are for ever guiltless before the LORD for the blood of Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.29'>May it fall upon the head of Jo'ab, and upon all his father's house; and may the house of Jo'ab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is leprous, or who holds a spindle, or who is slain by the sword, or who lacks bread!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.30'>So Jo'ab and Abi'shai his brother slew Abner, because he had killed their brother As'ahel in the battle at Gibeon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.31'>Then David said to Jo'ab and to all the people who were with him, "Rend your clothes, and gird on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner." And King David followed the bier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.32'>They buried Abner at Hebron; and the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner; and all the people wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.33'>And the king lamented for Abner, saying, "Should Abner die as a fool dies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.34'>Your hands were not bound, your feet were not fettered; as one falls before the wicked you have fallen." And all the people wept again over him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.35'>Then all the people came to persuade David to eat bread while it was yet day; but David swore, saying, "God do so to me and more also, if I taste bread or anything else till the sun goes down!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.36'>And all the people took notice of it, and it pleased them; as everything that the king did pleased all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.37'>So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the king's will to slay Abner the son of Ner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.38'>And the king said to his servants, "Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.3.39'>And I am this day weak, though anointed king; these men the sons of Zeru'iah are too hard for me. The LORD requite the evildoer according to his wickedness!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.1'>When Ish-bo'sheth, Saul's son, heard that Abner had died at Hebron, his courage failed, and all Israel was dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.2'>Now Saul's son had two men who were captains of raiding bands; the name of the one was Ba'anah, and the name of the other Rechab, sons of Rimmon a man of Benjamin from Be-er'oth (for Be-er'oth also is reckoned to Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.3'>the Be-er'othites fled to Gitta'im, and have been sojourners there to this day).</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.4'>Jonathan, the son of Saul, had a son who was crippled in his feet. He was five years old when the news about Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel; and his nurse took him up, and fled; and, as she fled in her haste, he fell, and became lame. And his name was Mephib'osheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.5'>Now the sons of Rimmon the Be-er'othite, Rechab and Ba'anah, set out, and about the heat of the day they came to the house of Ish-bo'sheth, as he was taking his noonday rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.6'>And behold, the doorkeeper of the house had been cleaning wheat, but she grew drowsy and slept; so Rechab and Ba'anah his brother slipped in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.7'>When they came into the house, as he lay on his bed in his bedchamber, they smote him, and slew him, and beheaded him. They took his head, and went by the way of the Arabah all night,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.8'>and brought the head of Ish-bo'sheth to David at Hebron. And they said to the king, "Here is the head of Ish-bo'sheth, the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; the LORD has avenged my lord the king this day on Saul and on his offspring."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.9'>But David answered Rechab and Ba'anah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Be-er'othite, "As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life out of every adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.10'>when one told me, `Behold, Saul is dead,' and thought he was bringing good news, I seized him and slew him at Ziklag, which was the reward I gave him for his news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.11'>How much more, when wicked men have slain a righteous man in his own house upon his bed, shall I not now require his blood at your hand, and destroy you from the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.4.12'>And David commanded his young men, and they killed them, and cut off their hands and feet, and hanged them beside the pool at Hebron. But they took the head of Ish-bo'sheth, and buried it in the tomb of Abner at Hebron.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.5.1'>Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron, and said, "Behold, we are your bone and flesh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.8'>Then David said to Uri'ah, "Go down to your house, and wash your feet." And Uri'ah went out of the king's house, and there followed him a present from the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.9'>But Uri'ah slept at the door of the king's house with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.10'>When they told David, "Uri'ah did not go down to his house," David said to Uri'ah, "Have you not come from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.11'>Uri'ah said to David, "The ark and Israel and Judah dwell in booths; and my lord Jo'ab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field; shall I then go to my house, to eat and to drink, and to lie with my wife? As you live, and as your soul lives, I will not do this thing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.12'>Then David said to Uri'ah, "Remain here today also, and tomorrow I will let you depart." So Uri'ah remained in Jerusalem that day, and the next.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.13'>And David invited him, and he ate in his presence and drank, so that he made him drunk; and in the evening he went out to lie on his couch with the servants of his lord, but he did not go down to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.14'>In the morning David wrote a letter to Jo'ab, and sent it by the hand of Uri'ah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.15'>In the letter he wrote, "Set Uri'ah in the forefront of the hardest fighting, and then draw back from him, that he may be struck down, and die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.16'>And as Jo'ab was besieging the city, he assigned Uri'ah to the place where he knew there were valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.17'>And the men of the city came out and fought with Jo'ab; and some of the servants of David among the people fell. Uri'ah the Hittite was slain also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.18'>Then Jo'ab sent and told David all the news about the fighting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.19'>and he instructed the messenger, "When you have finished telling all the news about the fighting to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.20'>then, if the king's anger rises, and if he says to you, `Why did you go so near the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.21'>Who killed Abim'elech the son of Jerub'besheth? Did not a woman cast an upper millstone upon him from the wall, so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?' then you shall say, `Your servant Uri'ah the Hittite is dead also.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.22'>So the messenger went, and came and told David all that Jo'ab had sent him to tell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.23'>The messenger said to David, "The men gained an advantage over us, and came out against us in the field; but we drove them back to the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.24'>Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall; some of the king's servants are dead; and your servant Uri'ah the Hittite is dead also."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.25'>David said to the messenger, "Thus shall you say to Jo'ab, `Do not let this matter trouble you, for the sword devours now one and now another; strengthen your attack upon the city, and overthrow it.' And encourage him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.26'>When the wife of Uri'ah heard that Uri'ah her husband was dead, she made lamentation for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.11.27'>And when the mourning was over, David sent and brought her to his house, and she became his wife, and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done displeased the LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.1'>And the LORD sent Nathan to David. He came to him, and said to him, "There were two men in a certain city, the one rich and the other poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.2'>The rich man had very many flocks and herds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.3'>but the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb, which he had bought. And he brought it up, and it grew up with him and with his children; it used to eat of his morsel, and drink from his cup, and lie in his bosom, and it was like a daughter to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.4'>Now there came a traveler to the rich man, and he was unwilling to take one of his own flock or herd to prepare for the wayfarer who had come to him, but he took the poor man's lamb, and prepared it for the man who had come to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.5'>Then David's anger was greatly kindled against the man; and he said to Nathan, "As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.6'>and he shall restore the lamb fourfold, because he did this thing, and because he had no pity."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.7'>Nathan said to David, "You are the man. Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, `I anointed you king over Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.8'>and I gave you your master's house, and your master's wives into your bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if this were too little, I would add to you as much more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.9'>Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his sight? You have smitten Uri'ah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.10'>Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uri'ah the Hittite to be your wife.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.11'>Thus says the LORD, `Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.12'>For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and before the sun.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.13'>David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." And Nathan said to David, "The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.14'>Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the LORD, the child that is born to you shall die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.15'>Then Nathan went to his house.  And the LORD struck the child that Uri'ah's wife bore to David, and it became sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.16'>David therefore besought God for the child; and David fasted, and went in and lay all night upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.17'>And the elders of his house stood beside him, to raise him from the ground; but he would not, nor did he eat food with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.18'>On the seventh day the child died. And the servants of David feared to tell him that the child was dead; for they said, "Behold, while the child was yet alive, we spoke to him, and he did not listen to us; how then can we say to him the child is dead? He may do himself some harm."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.19'>But when David saw that his servants were whispering together, David perceived that the child was dead; and David said to his servants, "Is the child dead?" They said, "He is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.20'>Then David arose from the earth, and washed, and anointed himself, and changed his clothes; and he went into the house of the LORD, and worshiped; he then went to his own house; and when he asked, they set food before him, and he ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.21'>Then his servants said to him, "What is this thing that you have done? You fasted and wept for the child while it was alive; but when the child died, you arose and ate food."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.22'>He said, "While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I said, `Who knows whether the LORD will be gracious to me, that the child may live?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.23'>But now he is dead; why should I fast? Can I bring him back again? I shall go to him, but he will not return to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.24'>Then David comforted his wife, Bathshe'ba, and went in to her, and lay with her; and she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And the LORD loved him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.25'>and sent a message by Nathan the prophet; so he called his name Jedidi'ah, because of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.26'>Now Jo'ab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites, and took the royal city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.27'>And Jo'ab sent messengers to David, and said, "I have fought against Rabbah; moreover, I have taken the city of waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.28'>Now, then, gather the rest of the people together, and encamp against the city, and take it; lest I take the city, and it be called by my name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.29'>So David gathered all the people together and went to Rabbah, and fought against it and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.30'>And he took the crown of their king from his head; the weight of it was a talent of gold, and in it was a precious stone; and it was placed on David's head. And he brought forth the spoil of the city, a very great amount.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.12.31'>And he brought forth the people who were in it, and set them to labor with saws and iron picks and iron axes, and made them toil at the brickkilns; and thus he did to all the cities of the Ammonites. Then David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.1'>Now Ab'salom, David's son, had a beautiful sister, whose name was Tamar; and after a time Amnon, David's son, loved her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.2'>And Amnon was so tormented that he made himself ill because of his sister Tamar; for she was a virgin, and it seemed impossible to Amnon to do anything to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.3'>But Amnon had a friend, whose name was Jon'adab, the son of Shim'e-ah, David's brother; and Jon'adab was a very crafty man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.4'>And he said to him, "O son of the king, why are you so haggard morning after morning? Will you not tell me?" Amnon said to him, "I love Tamar, my brother Ab'salom's sister."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.5'>Jon'adab said to him, "Lie down on your bed, and pretend to be ill; and when your father comes to see you, say to him, `Let my sister Tamar come and give me bread to eat, and prepare the food in my sight, that I may see it, and eat it from her hand.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.6'>So Amnon lay down, and pretended to be ill; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, "Pray let my sister Tamar come and make a couple of cakes in my sight, that I may eat from her hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.7'>Then David sent home to Tamar, saying, "Go to your brother Amnon's house, and prepare food for him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.8'>So Tamar went to her brother Amnon's house, where he was lying down. And she took dough, and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked the cakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.9'>And she took the pan and emptied it out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, "Send out every one from me." So every one went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.10'>Then Amnon said to Tamar, "Bring the food into the chamber, that I may eat from your hand." And Tamar took the cakes she had made, and brought them into the chamber to Amnon her brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.11'>But when she brought them near him to eat, he took hold of her, and said to her, "Come, lie with me, my sister."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.12'>She answered him, "No, my brother, do not force me; for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this wanton folly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.13'>As for me, where could I carry my shame? And as for you, you would be as one of the wanton fools in Israel. Now therefore, I pray you, speak to the king; for he will not withhold me from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.14'>But he would not listen to her; and being stronger than she, he forced her, and lay with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.15'>Then Amnon hated her with very great hatred; so that the hatred with which he hated her was greater than the love with which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, "Arise, be gone."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.16'>But she said to him, "No, my brother; for this wrong in sending me away is greater than the other which you did to me." But he would not listen to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.17'>He called the young man who served him and said, "Put this woman out of my presence, and bolt the door after her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.18'>Now she was wearing a long robe with sleeves; for thus were the virgin daughters of the king clad of old. So his servant put her out, and bolted the door after her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.19'>And Tamar put ashes on her head, and rent the long robe which she wore; and she laid her hand on her head, and went away, crying aloud as she went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.20'>And her brother Ab'salom said to her, "Has Amnon your brother been with you? Now hold your peace, my sister; he is your brother; do not take this to heart." So Tamar dwelt, a desolate woman, in her brother Ab'salom's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.21'>When King David heard of all these things, he was very angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.22'>But Ab'salom spoke to Amnon neither good nor bad; for Ab'salom hated Amnon, because he had forced his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.23'>After two full years Ab'salom had sheepshearers at Ba'al-ha'zor, which is near E'phraim, and Ab'salom invited all the king's sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.24'>And Ab'salom came to the king, and said, "Behold, your servant has sheepshearers; pray let the king and his servants go with your servant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.25'>But the king said to Ab'salom, "No, my son, let us not all go, lest we be burdensome to you." He pressed him, but he would not go but gave him his blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.26'>Then Ab'salom said, "If not, pray let my brother Amnon go with us." And the king said to him, "Why should he go with you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.27'>But Ab'salom pressed him until he let Amnon and all the king's sons go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.28'>Then Ab'salom commanded his servants, "Mark when Amnon's heart is merry with wine, and when I say to you, `Strike Amnon,' then kill him. Fear not; have I not commanded you? Be courageous and be valiant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.29'>So the servants of Ab'salom did to Amnon as Ab'salom had commanded. Then all the king's sons arose, and each mounted his mule and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.30'>While they were on the way, tidings came to David, "Ab'salom has slain all the king's sons, and not one of them is left."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.31'>Then the king arose, and rent his garments, and lay on the earth; and all his servants who were standing by rent their garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.32'>But Jon'adab the son of Shim'e-ah, David's brother, said, "Let not my lord suppose that they have killed all the young men the king's sons, for Amnon alone is dead, for by the command of Ab'salom this has been determined from the day he forced his sister Tamar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.33'>Now therefore let not my lord the king so take it to heart as to suppose that all the king's sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.34'>But Ab'salom fled. And the young man who kept the watch lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold, many people were coming from the Horona'im road by the side of the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.35'>And Jon'adab said to the king, "Behold, the king's sons have come; as your servant said, so it has come about."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.36'>And as soon as he had finished speaking, behold, the king's sons came, and lifted up their voice and wept; and the king also and all his servants wept very bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.37'>But Ab'salom fled, and went to Talmai the son of Ammi'hud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son day after day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.38'>So Ab'salom fled, and went to Geshur, and was there three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.13.39'>And the spirit of the king longed to go forth to Ab'salom; for he was comforted about Amnon, seeing he was dead.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.14'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.1'>Now Jo'ab the son of Zeru'iah perceived that the king's heart went out to Ab'salom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.2'>And Jo'ab sent to Teko'a, and fetched from there a wise woman, and said to her, "Pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning garments; do not anoint yourself with oil, but behave like a woman who has been mourning many days for the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.3'>and go to the king, and speak thus to him." So Jo'ab put the words in her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.4'>When the woman of Teko'a came to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, and did obeisance, and said, "Help, O king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.5'>And the king said to her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "Alas, I am a widow; my husband is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.6'>And your handmaid had two sons, and they quarreled with one another in the field; there was no one to part them, and one struck the other and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.7'>And now the whole family has risen against your handmaid, and they say, `Give up the man who struck his brother, that we may kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew'; and so they would destroy the heir also. Thus they would quench my coal which is left, and leave to my husband neither name nor remnant upon the face of the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.8'>Then the king said to the woman, "Go to your house, and I will give orders concerning you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.9'>And the woman of Teko'a said to the king, "On me be the guilt, my lord the king, and on my father's house; let the king and his throne be guiltless."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.10'>The king said, "If any one says anything to you, bring him to me, and he shall never touch you again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.11'>Then she said, "Pray let the king invoke the LORD your God, that the avenger of blood slay no more, and my son be not destroyed." He said, "As the LORD lives, not one hair of your son shall fall to the ground."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.12'>Then the woman said, "Pray let your handmaid speak a word to my lord the king." He said, "Speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.13'>And the woman said, "Why then have you planned such a thing against the people of God? For in giving this decision the king convicts himself, inasmuch as the king does not bring his banished one home again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.14'>We must all die, we are like water spilt on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again; but God will not take away the life of him who devises means not to keep his banished one an outcast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.15'>Now I have come to say this to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid; and your handmaid thought, `I will speak to the king; it may be that the king will perform the request of his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.16'>For the king will hear, and deliver his servant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the heritage of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.17'>And your handmaid thought, `The word of my lord the king will set me at rest'; for my lord the king is like the angel of God to discern good and evil. The LORD your God be with you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.18'>Then the king answered the woman, "Do not hide from me anything I ask you." And the woman said, "Let my lord the king speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.19'>The king said, "Is the hand of Jo'ab with you in all this?" The woman answered and said, "As surely as you live, my lord the king, one cannot turn to the right hand or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. It was your servant Jo'ab who bade me; it was he who put all these words in the mouth of your handmaid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.20'>In order to change the course of affairs your servant Jo'ab did this. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God to know all things that are on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.21'>Then the king said to Jo'ab, "Behold now, I grant this; go, bring back the young man Ab'salom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.22'>And Jo'ab fell on his face to the ground, and did obeisance, and blessed the king; and Jo'ab said, "Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord the king, in that the king has granted the request of his servant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.23'>So Jo'ab arose and went to Geshur, and brought Ab'salom to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.24'>And the king said, "Let him dwell apart in his own house; he is not to come into my presence." So Ab'salom dwelt apart in his own house, and did not come into the king's presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.25'>Now in all Israel there was no one so much to be praised for his beauty as Ab'salom; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.26'>And when he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of every year he used to cut it; when it was heavy on him, he cut it), he weighed the hair of his head, two hundred shekels by the king's weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.27'>There were born to Ab'salom three sons, and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.28'>So Ab'salom dwelt two full years in Jerusalem, without coming into the king's presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.29'>Then Ab'salom sent for Jo'ab, to send him to the king; but Jo'ab would not come to him. And he sent a second time, but Jo'ab would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.30'>Then he said to his servants, "See, Jo'ab's field is next to mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire." So Ab'salom's servants set the field on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.31'>Then Jo'ab arose and went to Ab'salom at his house, and said to him, "Why have your servants set my field on fire?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.32'>Ab'salom answered Jo'ab, "Behold, I sent word to you, `Come here, that I may send you to the king, to ask, "Why have I come from Geshur? It would be better for me to be there still." Now therefore let me go into the presence of the king; and if there is guilt in me, let him kill me.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.14.33'>Then Jo'ab went to the king, and told him; and he summoned Ab'salom. So he came to the king, and bowed himself on his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Ab'salom.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.15'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.1'>After this Ab'salom got himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.2'>And Ab'salom used to rise early and stand beside the way of the gate; and when any man had a suit to come before the king for judgment, Ab'salom would call to him, and say, "From what city are you?" And when he said, "Your servant is of such and such a tribe in Israel,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.3'>Ab'salom would say to him, "See, your claims are good and right; but there is no man deputed by the king to hear you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.4'>Ab'salom said moreover, "Oh that I were judge in the land! Then every man with a suit or cause might come to me, and I would give him justice."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.5'>And whenever a man came near to do obeisance to him, he would put out his hand, and take hold of him, and kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.6'>Thus Ab'salom did to all of Israel who came to the king for judgment; so Ab'salom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.7'>And at the end of four years Ab'salom said to the king, "Pray let me go and pay my vow, which I have vowed to the LORD, in Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.8'>For your servant vowed a vow while I dwelt at Geshur in Aram, saying, `If the LORD will indeed bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will offer worship to the LORD.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.9'>The king said to him, "Go in peace." So he arose, and went to Hebron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.10'>But Ab'salom sent secret messengers throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, "As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then say, `Ab'salom is king at Hebron!'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.11'>With Ab'salom went two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited guests, and they went in their simplicity, and knew nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.12'>And while Ab'salom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahith'ophel the Gi'lonite, David's counselor, from his city Giloh. And the conspiracy grew strong, and the people with Ab'salom kept increasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.13'>And a messenger came to David, saying, "The hearts of the men of Israel have gone after Ab'salom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.14'>Then David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, "Arise, and let us flee; or else there will be no escape for us from Ab'salom; go in haste, lest he overtake us quickly, and bring down evil upon us, and smite the city with the edge of the sword."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.15'>And the king's servants said to the king, "Behold, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.16'>So the king went forth, and all his household after him. And the king left ten concubines to keep the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.17'>And the king went forth, and all the people after him; and they halted at the last house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.18'>And all his servants passed by him; and all the Cher'ethites, and all the Pel'ethites, and all the six hundred Gittites who had followed him from Gath, passed on before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.19'>Then the king said to It'tai the Gittite, "Why do you also go with us? Go back, and stay with the king; for you are a foreigner, and also an exile from your home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.20'>You came only yesterday, and shall I today make you wander about with us, seeing I go I know not where? Go back, and take your brethren with you; and may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.21'>But It'tai answered the king, "As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, wherever my lord the king shall be, whether for death or for life, there also will your servant be."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.22'>And David said to It'tai, "Go then, pass on." So It'tai the Gittite passed on, with all his men and all the little ones who were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.23'>And all the country wept aloud as all the people passed by, and the king crossed the brook Kidron, and all the people passed on toward the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.24'>And Abi'athar came up, and lo, Zadok came also, with all the Levites, bearing the ark of the covenant of God; and they set down the ark of God, until the people had all passed out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.25'>Then the king said to Zadok, "Carry the ark of God back into the city. If I find favor in the eyes of the LORD, he will bring me back and let me see both it and his habitation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.26'>but if he says, `I have no pleasure in you,' behold, here I am, let him do to me what seems good to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.27'>The king also said to Zadok the priest, "Look, go back to the city in peace, you and Abi'athar, with your two sons, Ahim'a-az your son, and Jonathan the son of Abi'athar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.28'>See, I will wait at the fords of the wilderness, until word comes from you to inform me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.29'>So Zadok and Abi'athar carried the ark of God back to Jerusalem; and they remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.30'>But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, barefoot and with his head covered; and all the people who were with him covered their heads, and they went up, weeping as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.31'>And it was told David, "Ahith'ophel is among the conspirators with Ab'salom." And David said, "O LORD, I pray thee, turn the counsel of Ahith'ophel into foolishness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.32'>When David came to the summit, where God was worshiped, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat rent and earth upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.33'>David said to him, "If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.34'>But if you return to the city, and say to Ab'salom, `I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father's servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,' then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahith'ophel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.35'>Are not Zadok and Abi'athar the priests with you there? So whatever you hear from the king's house, tell it to Zadok and Abi'athar the priests.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Sam.15.37'>So Hushai, David's friend, came into the city, just as Ab'salom was entering Jerusalem.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.16'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.1'>When David had passed a little beyond the summit, Ziba the servant of Mephib'osheth met him, with a couple of asses saddled, bearing two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred of summer fruits, and a skin of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.2'>And the king said to Ziba, "Why have you brought these?" Ziba answered, "The asses are for the king's household to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine for those who faint in the wilderness to drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.3'>And the king said, "And where is your master's son?" Ziba said to the king, "Behold, he remains in Jerusalem; for he said, `Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.4'>Then the king said to Ziba, "Behold, all that belonged to Mephib'osheth is now yours." And Ziba said, "I do obeisance; let me ever find favor in your sight, my lord the king."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.5'>When King David came to Bahu'rim, there came out a man of the family of the house of Saul, whose name was Shim'e-i, the son of Gera; and as he came he cursed continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.6'>And he threw stones at David, and at all the servants of King David; and all the people and all the mighty men were on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.7'>And Shim'e-i said as he cursed, "Begone, begone, you man of blood, you worthless fellow!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.8'>The LORD has avenged upon you all the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Ab'salom. See, your ruin is on you; for you are a man of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.9'>Then Abi'shai the son of Zeru'iah said to the king, "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.10'>But the king said, "What have I to do with you, you sons of Zeru'iah? If he is cursing because the LORD has said to him, `Curse David,' who then shall say, `Why have you done so?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.11'>And David said to Abi'shai and to all his servants, "Behold, my own son seeks my life; how much more now may this Benjaminite! Let him alone, and let him curse; for the LORD has bidden him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.12'>It may be that the LORD will look upon my affliction, and that the LORD will repay me with good for this cursing of me today."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.13'>So David and his men went on the road, while Shim'e-i went along on the hillside opposite him and cursed as he went, and threw stones at him and flung dust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.14'>And the king, and all the people who were with him, arrived weary at the Jordan; and there he refreshed himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.15'>Now Ab'salom and all the people, the men of Israel, came to Jerusalem, and Ahith'ophel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.16'>And when Hushai the Archite, David's friend, came to Ab'salom, Hushai said to Ab'salom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.17'>And Ab'salom said to Hushai, "Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.18'>And Hushai said to Ab'salom, "No; for whom the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen, his I will be, and with him I will remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.19'>And again, whom should I serve? Should it not be his son? As I have served your father, so I will serve you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.20'>Then Ab'salom said to Ahith'ophel, "Give your counsel; what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.21'>Ahith'ophel said to Ab'salom, "Go in to your father's concubines, whom he has left to keep the house; and all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.22'>So they pitched a tent for Ab'salom upon the roof; and Ab'salom went in to his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.16.23'>Now in those days the counsel which Ahith'ophel gave was as if one consulted the oracle of God; so was all the counsel of Ahith'ophel esteemed, both by David and by Ab'salom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.17'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.1'>Moreover Ahith'ophel said to Ab'salom, "Let me choose twelve thousand men, and I will set out and pursue David tonight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.2'>I will come upon him while he is weary and discouraged, and throw him into a panic; and all the people who are with him will flee. I will strike down the king only,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.3'>and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride comes home to her husband. You seek the life of only one man, and all the people will be at peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.4'>And the advice pleased Ab'salom and all the elders of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.5'>Then Ab'salom said, "Call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.6'>And when Hushai came to Ab'salom, Ab'salom said to him, "Thus has Ahith'ophel spoken; shall we do as he advises? If not, you speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.7'>Then Hushai said to Ab'salom, "This time the counsel which Ahith'ophel has given is not good."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.8'>Hushai said moreover, "You know that your father and his men are mighty men, and that they are enraged, like a bear robbed of her cubs in the field. Besides, your father is expert in war; he will not spend the night with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.9'>Behold, even now he has hidden himself in one of the pits, or in some other place. And when some of the people fall at the first attack, whoever hears it will say, `There has been a slaughter among the people who follow Ab'salom.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.10'>Then even the valiant man, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will utterly melt with fear; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are valiant men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.11'>But my counsel is that all Israel be gathered to you, from Dan to Beer-sheba, as the sand by the sea for multitude, and that you go to battle in person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.12'>So we shall come upon him in some place where he is to be found, and we shall light upon him as the dew falls on the ground; and of him and all the men with him not one will be left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.13'>If he withdraws into a city, then all Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we shall drag it into the valley, until not even a pebble is to be found there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.14'>And Ab'salom and all the men of Israel said, "The counsel of Hushai the Archite is better than the counsel of Ahith'ophel." For the LORD had ordained to defeat the good counsel of Ahith'ophel, so that the LORD might bring evil upon Ab'salom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.15'>Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abi'athar the priests, "Thus and so did Ahith'ophel counsel Ab'salom and the elders of Israel; and thus and so have I counseled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.16'>Now therefore send quickly and tell David, `Do not lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but by all means pass over; lest the king and all the people who are with him be swallowed up.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.17'>Now Jonathan and Ahim'a-az were waiting at En-ro'gel; a maidservant used to go and tell them, and they would go and tell King David; for they must not be seen entering the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.18'>But a lad saw them, and told Ab'salom; so both of them went away quickly, and came to the house of a man at Bahu'rim, who had a well in his courtyard; and they went down into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.19'>And the woman took and spread a covering over the well's mouth, and scattered grain upon it; and nothing was known of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.20'>When Ab'salom's servants came to the woman at the house, they said, "Where are Ahim'a-az and Jonathan?" And the woman said to them, "They have gone over the brook of water." And when they had sought and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.21'>After they had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, "Arise, and go quickly over the water; for thus and so has Ahith'ophel counseled against you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.22'>Then David arose, and all the people who were with him, and they crossed the Jordan; by daybreak not one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.23'>When Ahith'ophel saw that his counsel was not followed, he saddled his ass, and went off home to his own city. And he set his house in order, and hanged himself; and he died, and was buried in the tomb of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.24'>Then David came to Mahana'im. And Ab'salom crossed the Jordan with all the men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.25'>Now Ab'salom had set Ama'sa over the army instead of Jo'ab. Ama'sa was the son of a man named Ithra the Ish'maelite, who had married Ab'igal the daughter of Nahash, sister of Zeru'iah, Jo'ab's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.26'>And Israel and Ab'salom encamped in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.27'>When David came to Mahana'im, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Am'miel from Lo-debar, and Barzil'lai the Gileadite from Ro'gelim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.28'>brought beds, basins, and earthen vessels, wheat, barley, meal, parched grain, beans and lentils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.17.29'>honey and curds and sheep and cheese from the herd, for David and the people with him to eat; for they said, "The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Sam.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.1'>Then David mustered the men who were with him, and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.2'>And David sent forth the army, one third under the command of Jo'ab, one third under the command of Abi'shai the son of Zeru'iah, Jo'ab's brother, and one third under the command of It'tai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, "I myself will also go out with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.3'>But the men said, "You shall not go out. For if we flee, they will not care about us. If half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us; therefore it is better that you send us help from the city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.4'>The king said to them, "Whatever seems best to you I will do." So the king stood at the side of the gate, while all the army marched out by hundreds and by thousands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.5'>And the king ordered Jo'ab and Abi'shai and It'tai, "Deal gently for my sake with the young man Ab'salom." And all the people heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Ab'salom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.6'>So the army went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was fought in the forest of E'phraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.7'>And the men of Israel were defeated there by the servants of David, and the slaughter there was great on that day, twenty thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.8'>The battle spread over the face of all the country; and the forest devoured more people that day than the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.9'>And Ab'salom chanced to meet the servants of David. Ab'salom was riding upon his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a great oak, and his head caught fast in the oak, and he was left hanging between heaven and earth, while the mule that was under him went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.10'>And a certain man saw it, and told Jo'ab, "Behold, I saw Ab'salom hanging in an oak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.11'>Jo'ab said to the man who told him, "What, you saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have been glad to give you ten pieces of silver and a girdle."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.12'>But the man said to Jo'ab, "Even if I felt in my hand the weight of a thousand pieces of silver, I would not put forth my hand against the king's son; for in our hearing the king commanded you and Abi'shai and It'tai, `For my sake protect the young man Ab'salom.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.13'>On the other hand, if I had dealt treacherously against his life (and there is nothing hidden from the king), then you yourself would have stood aloof."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.14'>Jo'ab said, "I will not waste time like this with you." And he took three darts in his hand, and thrust them into the heart of Ab'salom, while he was still alive in the oak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.15'>And ten young men, Jo'ab's armor-bearers, surrounded Ab'salom and struck him, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.16'>Then Jo'ab blew the trumpet, and the troops came back from pursuing Israel; for Jo'ab restrained them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.17'>And they took Ab'salom, and threw him into a great pit in the forest, and raised over him a very great heap of stones; and all Israel fled every one to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.18'>Now Ab'salom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself the pillar which is in the King's Valley, for he said, "I have no son to keep my name in remembrance"; he called the pillar after his own name, and it is called Ab'salom's monument to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.19'>Then said Ahi'ma-az the son of Zadok, "Let me run, and carry tidings to the king that the LORD has delivered him from the power of his enemies."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.20'>And Jo'ab said to him, "You are not to carry tidings today; you may carry tidings another day, but today you shall carry no tidings, because the king's son is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.21'>Then Jo'ab said to the Cushite, "Go, tell the king what you have seen." The Cushite bowed before Jo'ab, and ran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.22'>Then Ahi'ma-az the son of Zadok said again to Jo'ab, "Come what may, let me also run after the Cushite." And Jo'ab said, "Why will you run, my son, seeing that you will have no reward for the tidings?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.23'>"Come what may," he said, "I will run." So he said to him, "Run." Then Ahi'ma-az ran by the way of the plain, and outran the Cushite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.24'>Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he lifted up his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.18.25'>And the watchman called out and told the king. And the king said, "If he is alone, there are tidings in his mouth." And he came apace, and drew near.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.23'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.1'>Now these are the last words of David: The oracle of David, the son of Jesse, the oracle of the man who was raised on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the sweet psalmist of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.2'>"The Spirit of the LORD speaks by me, his word is upon my tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.3'>The God of Israel has spoken, the Rock of Israel has said to me: When one rules justly over men, ruling in the fear of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.4'>he dawns on them like the morning light, like the sun shining forth upon a cloudless morning, like rain that makes grass to sprout from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.5'>Yea, does not my house stand so with God? For he has made with me an everlasting covenant, ordered in all things and secure. For will he not cause to prosper all my help and my desire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.6'>But godless men are all like thorns that are thrown away; for they cannot be taken with the hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.7'>but the man who touches them arms himself with iron and the shaft of a spear, and they are utterly consumed with fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.8'>These are the names of the mighty men whom David had: Josheb-basshe'beth a Tah-che'monite; he was chief of the three; he wielded his spear against eight hundred whom he slew at one time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.9'>And next to him among the three mighty men was Elea'zar the son of Dodo, son of Aho'hi. He was with David when they defied the Philistines who were gathered there for battle, and the men of Israel withdrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.10'>He rose and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary, and his hand cleaved to the sword; and the LORD wrought a great victory that day; and the men returned after him only to strip the slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.11'>And next to him was Shammah, the son of Agee the Har'arite. The Philistines gathered together at Lehi, where there was a plot of ground full of lentils; and the men fled from the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.12'>But he took his stand in the midst of the plot, and defended it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD wrought a great victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.13'>And three of the thirty chief men went down, and came about harvest time to David at the cave of Adullam, when a band of Philistines was encamped in the valley of Reph'aim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.14'>David was then in the stronghold; and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.15'>And David said longingly, "O that some one would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem which is by the gate!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.16'>Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem which was by the gate, and took and brought it to David. But he would not drink of it; he poured it out to the LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.17'>and said, "Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should do this. Shall I drink the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?" Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.18'>Now Abi'shai, the brother of Jo'ab, the son of Zeru'iah, was chief of the thirty. And he wielded his spear against three hundred men and slew them, and won a name beside the three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.19'>He was the most renowned of the thirty, and became their commander; but he did not attain to the three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.20'>And Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada was a valiant man of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds; he smote two ariels of Moab. He also went down and slew a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.21'>And he slew an Egyptian, a handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand; but Benai'ah went down to him with a staff, and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own spear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.22'>These things did Benai'ah the son of Jehoi'ada, and won a name beside the three mighty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.23'>He was renowned among the thirty, but he did not attain to the three. And David set him over his bodyguard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.23.24'>As'ahel the brother of Jo'ab was one of the thirty; Elha'nan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Sam.24'>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.1'>Again the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, "Go, number Israel and Judah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.2'>So the king said to Jo'ab and the commanders of the army, who were with him, "Go through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan to Beer-sheba, and number the people, that I may know the number of the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.3'>But Jo'ab said to the king, "May the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as they are, while the eyes of my lord the king still see it; but why does my lord the king delight in this thing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.4'>But the king's word prevailed against Jo'ab and the commanders of the army. So Jo'ab and the commanders of the army went out from the presence of the king to number the people of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.5'>They crossed the Jordan, and began from Aro'er, and from the city that is in the middle of the valley, toward Gad and on to Jazer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.6'>Then they came to Gilead, and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites; and they came to Dan, and from Dan they went around to Sidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.7'>and came to the fortress of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites; and they went out to the Negeb of Judah at Beer-sheba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.8'>So when they had gone through all the land, they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.9'>And Jo'ab gave the sum of the numbering of the people to the king: in Israel there were eight hundred thousand valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were five hundred thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.10'>But David's heart smote him after he had numbered the people. And David said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, I pray thee, take away the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.11'>And when David arose in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David's seer, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.12'>"Go and say to David, `Thus says the LORD, Three things I offer you; choose one of them, that I may do it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.13'>So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, "Shall three years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your foes while they pursue you? Or shall there be three days' pestilence in your land? Now consider, and decide what answer I shall return to him who sent me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.14'>Then David said to Gad, "I am in great distress; let us fall into the hand of the LORD, for his mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hand of man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.15'>So the LORD sent a pestilence upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time; and there died of the people from Dan to Beer-sheba seventy thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.16'>And when the angel stretched forth his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD repented of the evil, and said to the angel who was working destruction among the people, "It is enough; now stay your hand." And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Arau'nah the Jeb'usite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.17'>Then David spoke to the LORD when he saw the angel who was smiting the people, and said, "Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let thy hand, I pray thee, be against me and against my father's house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.18'>And Gad came that day to David, and said to him, "Go up, rear an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Arau'nah the Jeb'usite."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.19'>So David went up at Gad's word, as the LORD commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.20'>And when Arau'nah looked down, he saw the king and his servants coming on toward him; and Arau'nah went forth, and did obeisance to the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.21'>And Arau'nah said, "Why has my lord the king come to his servant?" David said, "To buy the threshing floor of you, in order to build an altar to the LORD, that the plague may be averted from the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.22'>Then Arau'nah said to David, "Let my lord the king take and offer up what seems good to him; here are the oxen for the burnt offering, and the threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.23'>All this, O king, Arau'nah gives to the king." And Arau'nah said to the king, "The LORD your God accept you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.24'>But the king said to Arau'nah, "No, but I will buy it of you for a price; I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God which cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Sam.24.25'>And David built there an altar to the LORD, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD heeded supplications for the land, and the plague was averted from Israel.</verse>
