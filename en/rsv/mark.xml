      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <title>So they went and made the sepulchre secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard.</title>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>the voice of one crying in the wilderness: Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight--"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John the baptizer appeared in the wilderness, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And there went out to him all the country of Judea, and all the people of Jerusalem; and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Now John was clothed with camel's hair, and had a leather girdle around his waist, and ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you with water; but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opened and the Spirit descending upon him like a dove;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>and a voice came from heaven, "Thou art my beloved Son; with thee I am well pleased."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the wilderness forty days, tempted by Satan; and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent, and believe in the gospel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And passing along by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net in the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, "Follow me and I will make you become fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zeb'edee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately he called them; and they left their father Zeb'edee in the boat with the hired servants, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Caper'na-um; and immediately on the sabbath he entered the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>and he cried out, "What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are, the Holy One of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching! With authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And immediately he left the synagogue, and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon's mother-in-law lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her; and she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>That evening, at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or possessed with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole city was gathered together about the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons; and he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the morning, a great while before day, he rose and went out to a lonely place, and there he prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those who were with him pursued him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and they found him and said to him, "Every one is searching for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he said to them, "Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also; for that is why I came out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper came to him beseeching him, and kneeling said to him, "If you will, you can make me clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, "I will; be clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he sternly charged him, and sent him away at once,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and said to him, "See that you say nothing to any one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in the country; and people came to him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And when he returned to Caper'na-um after some days, it was reported that he was at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And many were gathered together, so that there was no longer room for them, not even about the door; and he was preaching the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him; and when they had made an opening, they let down the pallet on which the paralytic lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, "My son, your sins are forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>"Why does this man speak thus? It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you question thus in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, `Rise, take up your pallet and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins"--he said to the paralytic--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>"I say to you, rise, take up your pallet and go home."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he rose, and immediately took up the pallet and went out before them all; so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>He went out again beside the sea; and all the crowd gathered about him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he passed on, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he rose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And as he sat at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were sitting with Jesus and his disciples; for there were many who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick; I came not to call the righteous, but sinners."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting; and people came and said to him, "Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, "Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>The days will come, when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; if he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; if he does, the wine will burst the skins, and the wine is lost, and so are the skins; but new wine is for fresh skins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>One sabbath he was going through the grainfields; and as they made their way his disciples began to pluck heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him, "Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them, "Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered the house of God, when Abi'athar was high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, "The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>so the Son of man is lord even of the sabbath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they watched him, to see whether he would heal him on the sabbath, so that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he said to the man who had the withered hand, "Come here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he said to them, "Is it lawful on the sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill?" But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>The Pharisees went out, and immediately held counsel with the Hero'di-ans against him, how to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed; also from Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and Jerusalem and Idume'a and from beyond the Jordan and from about Tyre and Sidon a great multitude, hearing all that he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they should crush him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed upon him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And whenever the unclean spirits beheld him, they fell down before him and cried out, "You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he strictly ordered them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he went up on the mountain, and called to him those whom he desired; and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve, to be with him, and to be sent out to preach</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and have authority to cast out demons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>Simon whom he surnamed Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James the son of Zeb'edee and John the brother of James, whom he surnamed Bo-aner'ges, that is, sons of thunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.  Then he went home;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>and the crowd came together again, so that they could not even eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for people were saying, "He is beside himself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He is possessed by Be-el'zebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And he called them to him, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man; then indeed he may plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>"Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, and whatever blasphemies they utter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>for they had said, "He has an unclean spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>And his mother and his brothers came; and standing outside they sent to him and called him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a crowd was sitting about him; and they said to him, "Your mother and your brothers are outside, asking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he replied, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking around on those who sat about him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>Whoever does the will of God is my brother, and sister, and mother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea; and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>"Listen! A sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it had not much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>and when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Other seed fell among thorns and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And other seeds fell into good soil and brought forth grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, those who were about him with the twelve asked him concerning the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, "To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand; lest they should turn again, and be forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said to them, "Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown; when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word which is sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these in like manner are the ones sown upon rocky ground, who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others are the ones sown among thorns; they are those who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>but the cares of the world, and the delight in riches, and the desire for other things, enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>But those that were sown upon the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, "Is a lamp brought in to be put under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on a stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hid, except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret, except to come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, "Take heed what you hear; the measure you give will be the measure you get, and still more will be given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For to him who has will more be given; and from him who has not, even what he has will be taken away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, "The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed upon the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should sprout and grow, he knows not how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>The earth produces of itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, "With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown upon the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes the greatest of all shrubs, and puts forth large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>he did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And a great storm of wind arose, and the waves beat into the boat, so that the boat was already filling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion; and they woke him and said to him, "Teacher, do you not care if we perish?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he awoke and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace! Be still!" And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>He said to them, "Why are you afraid? Have you no faith?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they were filled with awe, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Ger'asenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he had come out of the boat, there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who lived among the tombs; and no one could bind him any more, even with a chain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>for he had often been bound with fetters and chains, but the chains he wrenched apart, and the fetters he broke in pieces; and no one had the strength to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out, and bruising himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and worshiped him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he had said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And Jesus asked him, "What is your name?" He replied, "My name is Legion; for we are many."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he begged him eagerly not to send them out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now a great herd of swine was feeding there on the hillside;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>and they begged him, "Send us to the swine, let us enter them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>So he gave them leave. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the swine; and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and were drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>The herdsmen fled, and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they came to Jesus, and saw the demoniac sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, the man who had had the legion; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who had seen it told what had happened to the demoniac and to the swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their neighborhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But he refused, and said to him, "Go home to your friends, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decap'olis how much Jesus had done for him; and all men marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him; and he was beside the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Ja'irus by name; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and besought him, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well, and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And he went with him.  And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And there was a woman who had had a flow of blood for twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>She had heard the reports about Jesus, and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, "If I touch even his garments, I shall be made well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately the hemorrhage ceased; and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone forth from him, immediately turned about in the crowd, and said, "Who touched my garments?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And his disciples said to him, "You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, `Who touched me?'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked around to see who had done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman, knowing what had been done to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him, and told him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, "Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But ignoring what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Do not fear, only believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>When they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, he saw a tumult, and people weeping and wailing loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when he had entered, he said to them, "Why do you make a tumult and weep? The child is not dead but sleeping."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside, and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>Taking her by the hand he said to her, "Tal'itha cu'mi"; which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the girl got up and walked (she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>He went away from there and came to his own country; and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And on the sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue; and many who heard him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get all this? What is the wisdom given to him? What mighty works are wrought by his hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon, and are not his sisters here with us?" And they took offense at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>And Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own kin, and in his own house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands upon a few sick people and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he marveled because of their unbelief.  And he went about among the villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he called to him the twelve, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff; no bread, no bag, no money in their belts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, "Where you enter a house, stay there until you leave the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And if any place will not receive you and they refuse to hear you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>So they went out and preached that men should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they cast out many demons, and anointed with oil many that were sick and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>King Herod heard of it; for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, "John the baptizer has been raised from the dead; that is why these powers are at work in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>But others said, "It is Eli'jah." And others said, "It is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herod heard of it he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod had sent and seized John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Hero'di-as, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>And Hero'di-as had a grudge against him, and wanted to kill him. But she could not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he was much perplexed; and yet he heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his courtiers and officers and the leading men of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>For when Hero'di-as' daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests; and the king said to the girl, "Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will grant it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he vowed to her, "Whatever you ask me, I will give you, even half of my kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>And she went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?" And she said, "The head of John the baptizer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>And she came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And the king was exceedingly sorry; but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>And immediately the king sent a soldier of the guard and gave orders to bring his head. He went and beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body, and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>The apostles returned to Jesus, and told him all that they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And he said to them, "Come away by yourselves to a lonely place, and rest a while." For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>And they went away in the boat to a lonely place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>Now many saw them going, and knew them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns, and got there ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>As he went ashore he saw a great throng, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a lonely place, and the hour is now late;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>send them away, to go into the country and villages round about and buy themselves something to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But he answered them, "You give them something to eat." And they said to him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give it to them to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>And he said to them, "How many loaves have you? Go and see." And when they had found out, they said, "Five, and two fish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Then he commanded them all to sit down by companies upon the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven, and blessed, and broke the loaves, and gave them to the disciples to set before the people; and he divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>And they all ate and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Beth-sa'ida, while he dismissed the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for they all saw him, and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, "Take heart, it is I; have no fear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he got into the boat with them and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennes'aret, and moored to the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they got out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>and ran about the whole neighborhood and began to bring sick people on their pallets to any place where they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or country, they laid the sick in the market places, and besought him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched it were made well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Now when the Pharisees gathered together to him, with some of the scribes, who had come from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands defiled, that is, unwashed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat unless they wash their hands, observing the tradition of the elders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>and when they come from the market place, they do not eat unless they purify themselves; and there are many other traditions which they observe, the washing of cups and pots and vessels of bronze.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with hands defiled?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>And he said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, `This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the precepts of men.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>You leave the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And he said to them, "You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God, in order to keep your tradition!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother'; and, `He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die';</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>but you say, `If a man tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is Corban' (that is, given to God)--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>thus making void the word of God through your tradition which you hand on. And many such things you do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And he called the people to him again, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>there is nothing outside a man which by going into him can defile him; but the things which come out of a man are what defile him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>And when he had entered the house, and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>And he said to them, "Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a man from outside cannot defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>since it enters, not his heart but his stomach, and so passes on?" (Thus he declared all foods clean.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>And he said, "What comes out of a man is what defiles a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, fornication, theft, murder, adultery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>coveting, wickedness, deceit, licentiousness, envy, slander, pride, foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>All these evil things come from within, and they defile a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house, and would not have any one know it; yet he could not be hid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>But immediately a woman, whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, heard of him, and came and fell down at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoeni'cian by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>And he said to her, "Let the children first be fed, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But she answered him, "Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>And he said to her, "For this saying you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>And she went home, and found the child lying in bed, and the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>Then he returned from the region of Tyre, and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, through the region of the Decap'olis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech; and they besought him to lay his hand upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>And taking him aside from the multitude privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and he spat and touched his tongue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>and looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Eph'phatha," that is, "Be opened."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>And he charged them to tell no one; but the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well; he even makes the deaf hear and the dumb speak."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>"I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days, and have nothing to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>and if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way; and some of them have come a long way."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>And his disciples answered him, "How can one feed these men with bread here in the desert?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he asked them, "How many loaves have you?" They said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground; and he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he commanded that these also should be set before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>And there were about four thousand people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And he sent them away; and immediately he got into the boat with his disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanu'tha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven, to test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>Now they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And he cautioned them, saying, "Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they discussed it with one another, saying, "We have no bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>And being aware of it, Jesus said to them, "Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up?" They said to him, "Twelve."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And he sent him away to his home, saying, "Do not even enter the village."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jesus went on with his disciples, to the villages of Caesare'a Philip'pi; and on the way he asked his disciples, "Who do men say that I am?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And there appeared to them Eli'jah with Moses; and they were talking to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>And Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is well that we are here; let us make three booths, one for you and one for Moses and one for Eli'jah."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, "This is my beloved Son; listen to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And suddenly looking around they no longer saw any one with them but Jesus only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of man should have risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what the rising from the dead meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they asked him, "Why do the scribes say that first Eli'jah must come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>And he said to them, "Eli'jah does come first to restore all things; and how is it written of the Son of man, that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he asked them, "What are you discussing with them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>And one of the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a dumb spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>and wherever it seizes him, it dashes him down; and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid; and I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>And he answered them, "O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>And they brought the boy to him; and when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>And Jesus asked his father, "How long has he had this?" And he said, "From childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And it has often cast him into the fire and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have pity on us and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>And Jesus said to him, "If you can! All things are possible to him who believes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, "I believe; help my unbelief!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You dumb and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and never enter him again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse; so that most of them said, "He is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, "Why could we not cast it out?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he would not have any one know it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, "The Son of man will be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him; and when he is killed, after three days he will rise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand the saying, and they were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>And they came to Caper'na-um; and when he was in the house he asked them, "What were you discussing on the way?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they were silent; for on the way they had discussed with one another who was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>And he sat down and called the twelve; and he said to them, "If any one would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And he took a child, and put him in the midst of them; and taking him in his arms, he said to them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And he sat down opposite the treasury, and watched the multitude putting money into the treasury. Many rich people put in large sums.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And a poor widow came, and put in two copper coins, which make a penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And he called his disciples to him, and said to them, "Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the treasury.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he sat at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>But there were some who said to themselves indignantly, "Why was the ointment thus wasted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>For this ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, and given to the poor." And they reproached her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.34'>And he said to them, "My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And the high priest stood up in the midst, and asked Jesus, "Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>And the high priest tore his garments, and said, "Why do we still need witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision?" And they all condemned him as deserving death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to strike him, saying to him, "Prophesy!" And the guards received him with blows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the maids of the high priest came;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him, and said, "You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you mean." And he went out into the gateway.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But again he denied it. And after a little while again the bystanders said to Peter, "Certainly you are one of them; for you are a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, "I do not know this man of whom you speak."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?" But they shouted all the more, "Crucify him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barab'bas; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the praetorium); and they called together the whole battalion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and plaiting a crown of thorns they put it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And they began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they struck his head with a reed, and spat upon him, and they knelt down in homage to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak, and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they compelled a passer-by, Simon of Cyre'ne, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought him to the place called Gol'gotha (which means the place of a skull).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they offered him wine mingled with myrrh; but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And they crucified him, and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour, when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of the charge against him read, "The King of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Aha! You who would destroy the temple and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>save yourself, and come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>So also the chief priests mocked him to one another with the scribes, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, that we may see and believe." Those who were crucified with him also reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "E'lo-i, E'lo-i, la'ma sabach-tha'ni?" which means, "My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And some of the bystanders hearing it said, "Behold, he is calling Eli'jah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And one ran and, filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Wait, let us see whether Eli'jah will come to take him down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And Jesus uttered a loud cry, and breathed his last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that he thus breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>There were also women looking on from afar, among whom were Mary Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salo'me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and ministered to him; and also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>Joseph of Arimathe'a, a respected member of the council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate, and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>And Pilate wondered if he were already dead; and summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And he bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud, and laid him in a tomb which had been hewn out of the rock; and he rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>Mary Mag'dalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the sabbath was past, Mary Mag'dalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salo'me, bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early on the first day of the week they went to the tomb when the sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they were saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the tomb?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back; --it was very large.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe; and they were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>And he said to them, "Do not be amazed; you seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen, he is not here; see the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him, as he told you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out and fled from the tomb; for trembling and astonishment had come upon them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After this he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they sat at table; and he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, "Go into all the world and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who does not believe will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they will pick up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it. Amen.</verse>
