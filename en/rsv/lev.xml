        <title>And Moses saw all the work, and behold, they had done it; as the LORD had commanded, so had they done it. And Moses blessed them.</title>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.1'>The LORD called Moses, and spoke to him from the tent of meeting, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.2'>"Speak to the people of Israel, and say to them, When any man of you brings an offering to the LORD, you shall bring your offering of cattle from the herd or from the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.3'>"If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish; he shall offer it at the door of the tent of meeting, that he may be accepted before the LORD;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.4'>he shall lay his hand upon the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.5'>Then he shall kill the bull before the LORD; and Aaron's sons the priests shall present the blood, and throw the blood round about against the altar that is at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.6'>And he shall flay the burnt offering and cut it into pieces;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.7'>and the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order upon the fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.8'>and Aaron's sons the priests shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire upon the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.9'>but its entrails and its legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall burn the whole on the altar, as a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.10'>"If his gift for a burnt offering is from the flock, from the sheep or goats, he shall offer a male without blemish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.11'>and he shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron's sons the priests shall throw its blood against the altar round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.12'>And he shall cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall lay them in order upon the wood that is on the fire upon the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.13'>but the entrails and the legs he shall wash with water. And the priest shall offer the whole, and burn it on the altar; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.14'>"If his offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves or of young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.15'>And the priest shall bring it to the altar and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.16'>and he shall take away its crop with the feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east side, in the place for ashes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.1.17'>he shall tear it by its wings, but shall not divide it asunder. And the priest shall burn it on the altar, upon the wood that is on the fire; it is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.1'>"When any one brings a cereal offering as an offering to the LORD, his offering shall be of fine flour; he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense on it,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.2.3'>And what is left of the cereal offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings by fire to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.4'>"When you bring a cereal offering baked in the oven as an offering, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.5'>And if your offering is a cereal offering baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine flour unleavened, mixed with oil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.6'>you shall break it in pieces, and pour oil on it; it is a cereal offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.7'>And if your offering is a cereal offering cooked in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.2.10'>And what is left of the cereal offering shall be for Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings by fire to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.11'>"No cereal offering which you bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven; for you shall burn no leaven nor any honey as an offering by fire to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.12'>As an offering of first fruits you may bring them to the LORD, but they shall not be offered on the altar for a pleasing odor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.13'>You shall season all your cereal offerings with salt; you shall not let the salt of the covenant with your God be lacking from your cereal offering; with all your offerings you shall offer salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.14'>"If you offer a cereal offering of first fruits to the LORD, you shall offer for the cereal offering of your first fruits crushed new grain from fresh ears, parched with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.15'>And you shall put oil upon it, and lay frankincense on it; it is a cereal offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.2.16'>And the priest shall burn as its memorial portion part of the crushed grain and of the oil with all of its frankincense; it is an offering by fire to the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.3.2'>And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering and kill it at the door of the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons the priests shall throw the blood against the altar round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.3'>And from the sacrifice of the peace offering, as an offering by fire to the LORD, he shall offer the fat covering the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.4'>and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.5'>Then Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt offering, which is upon the wood on the fire; it is an offering by fire, a pleasing odor to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.6'>"If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering to the LORD is an animal from the flock, male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.3.8'>laying his hand upon the head of his offering and killing it before the tent of meeting; and Aaron's sons shall throw its blood against the altar round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.9'>Then from the sacrifice of the peace offering as an offering by fire to the LORD he shall offer its fat, the fat tail entire, taking it away close by the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat that is on the entrails,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.3.10'>and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the appendage of the liver which he shall take away with the kidneys.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.4.1'>And the LORD said to Moses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.2'>"Say to the people of Israel, If any one sins unwittingly in any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and does any one of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.3'>if it is the anointed priest who sins, thus bringing guilt on the people, then let him offer for the sin which he has committed a young bull without blemish to the LORD for a sin offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.4'>He shall bring the bull to the door of the tent of meeting before the LORD, and lay his hand on the head of the bull, and kill the bull before the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.4.7'>And the priest shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense before the LORD which is in the tent of meeting, and the rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.8'>And all the fat of the bull of the sin offering he shall take from it, the fat that covers the entrails and all the fat that is on the entrails,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.4.12'>the whole bull he shall carry forth outside the camp to a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and shall burn it on a fire of wood; where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.13'>"If the whole congregation of Israel commits a sin unwittingly and the thing is hidden from the eyes of the assembly, and they do any one of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done and are guilty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.14'>when the sin which they have committed becomes known, the assembly shall offer a young bull for a sin offering and bring it before the tent of meeting;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.4.21'>And he shall carry forth the bull outside the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.22'>"When a ruler sins, doing unwittingly any one of all the things which the LORD his God has commanded not to be done, and is guilty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.23'>if the sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring as his offering a goat, a male without blemish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.24'>and shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD; it is a sin offering.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.4.26'>And all its fat he shall burn on the altar, like the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings; so the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.27'>"If any one of the common people sins unwittingly in doing any one of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and is guilty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.28'>when the sin which he has committed is made known to him he shall bring for his offering a goat, a female without blemish, for his sin which he has committed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.4.31'>And all its fat he shall remove, as the fat is removed from the peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it upon the altar for a pleasing odor to the LORD; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.32'>"If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.33'>and lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and kill it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.34'>Then the priest shall take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and pour out the rest of its blood at the base of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.4.35'>And all its fat he shall remove as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings, and the priest shall burn it on the altar, upon the offerings by fire to the LORD; and the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Lev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.1'>"If any one sins in that he hears a public adjuration to testify and though he is a witness, whether he has seen or come to know the matter, yet does not speak, he shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.2'>Or if any one touches an unclean thing, whether the carcass of an unclean beast or a carcass of unclean cattle or a carcass of unclean swarming things, and it is hidden from him, and he has become unclean, he shall be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.3'>Or if he touches human uncleanness, of whatever sort the uncleanness may be with which one becomes unclean, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it he shall be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.4'>Or if any one utters with his lips a rash oath to do evil or to do good, any sort of rash oath that men swear, and it is hidden from him, when he comes to know it he shall in any of these be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.5'>When a man is guilty in any of these, he shall confess the sin he has committed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.6'>and he shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD for the sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make atonement for him for his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.7'>"But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring, as his guilt offering to the LORD for the sin which he has committed, two turtledoves or two young pigeons, one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.8'>He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering; he shall wring its head from its neck, but shall not sever it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.9'>and he shall sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, while the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.10'>Then he shall offer the second for a burnt offering according to the ordinance; and the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.11'>"But if he cannot afford two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring, as his offering for the sin which he has committed, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, and shall put no frankincense on it, for it is a sin offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.12'>And he shall bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take a handful of it as its memorial portion and burn this on the altar, upon the offerings by fire to the LORD; it is a sin offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.13'>Thus the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in any one of these things, and he shall be forgiven. And the remainder shall be for the priest, as in the cereal offering."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.14'>The LORD said to Moses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.15'>"If any one commits a breach of faith and sins unwittingly in any of the holy things of the LORD, he shall bring, as his guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued by you in shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; it is a guilt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.16'>He shall also make restitution for what he has done amiss in the holy thing, and shall add a fifth to it and give it to the priest; and the priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.17'>"If any one sins, doing any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, though he does not know it, yet he is guilty and shall bear his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.5.18'>He shall bring to the priest a ram without blemish out of the flock, valued by you at the price for a guilt offering, and the priest shall make atonement for him for the error which he committed unwittingly, and he shall be forgiven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.15'>And if he who dedicates it wishes to redeem his house, he shall add a fifth of the valuation in money to it, and it shall be his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.16'>"If a man dedicates to the LORD part of the land which is his by inheritance, then your valuation shall be according to the seed for it; a sowing of a homer of barley shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.17'>If he dedicates his field from the year of jubilee, it shall stand at your full valuation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.18'>but if he dedicates his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall compute the money-value for it according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, and a deduction shall be made from your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.19'>And if he who dedicates the field wishes to redeem it, then he shall add a fifth of the valuation in money to it, and it shall remain his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.20'>But if he does not wish to redeem the field, or if he has sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.21'>but the field, when it is released in the jubilee, shall be holy to the LORD, as a field that has been devoted; the priest shall be in possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.22'>If he dedicates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not a part of his possession by inheritance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.23'>then the priest shall compute the valuation for it up to the year of jubilee, and the man shall give the amount of the valuation on that day as a holy thing to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.24'>In the year of jubilee the field shall return to him from whom it was bought, to whom the land belongs as a possession by inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.25'>Every valuation shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.26'>"But a firstling of animals, which as a firstling belongs to the LORD, no man may dedicate; whether ox or sheep, it is the LORD's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.27'>And if it is an unclean animal, then he shall buy it back at your valuation, and add a fifth to it; or, if it is not redeemed, it shall be sold at your valuation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.28'>"But no devoted thing that a man devotes to the LORD, of anything that he has, whether of man or beast, or of his inherited field, shall be sold or redeemed; every devoted thing is most holy to the LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lev.27.32'>And all the tithe of herds and flocks, every tenth animal of all that pass under the herdsman's staff, shall be holy to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.33'>A man shall not inquire whether it is good or bad, neither shall he exchange it; and if he exchanges it, then both it and that for which it is exchanged shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lev.27.34'>These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses for the people of Israel on Mount Sinai.</verse>
