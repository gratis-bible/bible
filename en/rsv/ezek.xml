      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <title>The punishment of your iniquity, O daughter of Zion, is accomplished, he will keep you in exile no longer; but your iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he will punish, he will uncover your sins.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>In the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I was among the exiles by the river Chebar, the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>On the fifth day of the month (it was the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoi'achin),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>the word of the LORD came to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chalde'ans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was upon him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, and a great cloud, with brightness round about it, and fire flashing forth continually, and in the midst of the fire, as it were gleaming bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>And from the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the form of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>but each had four faces, and each of them had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>Their legs were straight, and the soles of their feet were like the sole of a calf's foot; and they sparkled like burnished bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>Under their wings on their four sides they had human hands. And the four had their faces and their wings thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>their wings touched one another; they went every one straight forward, without turning as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, each had the face of a man in front; the four had the face of a lion on the right side, the four had the face of an ox on the left side, and the four had the face of an eagle at the back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Such were their faces. And their wings were spread out above; each creature had two wings, each of which touched the wing of another, while two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And each went straight forward; wherever the spirit would go, they went, without turning as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>In the midst of the living creatures there was something that looked like burning coals of fire, like torches moving to and fro among the living creatures; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures darted to and fro, like a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel upon the earth beside the living creatures, one for each of the four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>As for the appearance of the wheels and their construction: their appearance was like the gleaming of a chrysolite; and the four had the same likeness, their construction being as it were a wheel within a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>The four wheels had rims and they had spokes; and their rims were full of eyes round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them; and when the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit would go, they went, and the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those rose from the earth, the wheels rose along with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>Over the heads of the living creatures there was the likeness of a firmament, shining like crystal, spread out above their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the firmament their wings were stretched out straight, one toward another; and each creature had two wings covering its body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the sound of their wings like the sound of many waters, like the thunder of the Almighty, a sound of tumult like the sound of a host; when they stood still, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there came a voice from above the firmament over their heads; when they stood still, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the firmament over their heads there was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like sapphire; and seated above the likeness of a throne was a likeness as it were of a human form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And upward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were gleaming bronze, like the appearance of fire enclosed round about; and downward from what had the appearance of his loins I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and there was brightness round about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>Like the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud on the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about.  Such was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said to me, "Son of man, stand upon your feet, and I will speak with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And when he spoke to me, the Spirit entered into me and set me upon my feet; and I heard him speaking to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said to me, "Son of man, I send you to the people of Israel, to a nation of rebels, who have rebelled against me; they and their fathers have transgressed against me to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>The people also are impudent and stubborn: I send you to them; and you shall say to them, `Thus says the Lord GOD.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And whether they hear or refuse to hear (for they are a rebellious house) they will know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And you, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with you and you sit upon scorpions; be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And you shall speak my words to them, whether they hear or refuse to hear; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>"But you, son of man, hear what I say to you; be not rebellious like that rebellious house; open your mouth, and eat what I give you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And when I looked, behold, a hand was stretched out to me, and, lo, a written scroll was in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>and he spread it before me; and it had writing on the front and on the back, and there were written on it words of lamentation and mourning and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>And he said to me, "Son of man, eat what is offered to you; eat this scroll, and go, speak to the house of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said to me, "Son of man, eat this scroll that I give you and fill your stomach with it." Then I ate it; and it was in my mouth as sweet as honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said to me, "Son of man, go, get you to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For you are not sent to a people of foreign speech and a hard language, but to the house of Israel--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many peoples of foreign speech and a hard language, whose words you cannot understand. Surely, if I sent you to such, they would listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not listen to you; for they are not willing to listen to me; because all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stubborn heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made your face hard against their faces, and your forehead hard against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>Like adamant harder than flint have I made your forehead; fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, for they are a rebellious house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said to me, "Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to you receive in your heart, and hear with your ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go, get you to the exiles, to your people, and say to them, `Thus says the Lord GOD'; whether they hear or refuse to hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the LORD arose from its place, I heard behind me the sound of a great earthquake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>it was the sound of the wings of the living creatures as they touched one another, and the sound of the wheels beside them, that sounded like a great earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>The Spirit lifted me up and took me away, and I went in bitterness in the heat of my spirit, the hand of the LORD being strong upon me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>and I came to the exiles at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Chebar. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And at the end of seven days, the word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>"Son of man, I have made you a watchman for the house of Israel; whenever you hear a word from my mouth, you shall give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>If I say to the wicked, `You shall surely die,' and you give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked from his wicked way, in order to save his life, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood I will require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>But if you warn the wicked, and he does not turn from his wickedness, or from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but you will have saved your life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, if a righteous man turns from his righteousness and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die; because you have not warned him, he shall die for his sin, and his righteous deeds which he has done shall not be remembered; but his blood I will require at your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if you warn the righteous man not to sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning; and you will have saved your life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, "Arise, go forth into the plain, and there I will speak with you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>So I arose and went forth into the plain; and, lo, the glory of the LORD stood there, like the glory which I had seen by the river Chebar; and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>But the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet; and he spoke with me and said to me, "Go, shut yourself within your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>And you, O son of man, behold, cords will be placed upon you, and you shall be bound with them, so that you cannot go out among the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>and I will make your tongue cleave to the roof of your mouth, so that you shall be dumb and unable to reprove them; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with you, I will open your mouth, and you shall say to them, `Thus says the Lord GOD'; he that will hear, let him hear; and he that will refuse to hear, let him refuse; for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>"And you, O son of man, take a brick and lay it before you, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>and put siegeworks against it, and build a siege wall against it, and cast up a mound against it; set camps also against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>And take an iron plate, and place it as an iron wall between you and the city; and set your face toward it, and let it be in a state of siege, and press the siege against it. This is a sign for the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>"Then lie upon your left side, and I will lay the punishment of the house of Israel upon you; for the number of the days that you lie upon it, you shall bear their punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I assign to you a number of days, three hundred and ninety days, equal to the number of the years of their punishment; so long shall you bear the punishment of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when you have completed these, you shall lie down a second time, but on your right side, and bear the punishment of the house of Judah; forty days I assign you, a day for each year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>And you shall set your face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with your arm bared; and you shall prophesy against the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I will put cords upon you, so that you cannot turn from one side to the other, till you have completed the days of your siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>"And you, take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt, and put them into a single vessel, and make bread of them. During the number of days that you lie upon your side, three hundred and ninety days, you shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And the food which you eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day; once a day you shall eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>And water you shall drink by measure, the sixth part of a hin; once a day you shall drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And you shall eat it as a barley cake, baking it in their sight on human dung."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And the LORD said, "Thus shall the people of Israel eat their bread unclean, among the nations whither I will drive them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! behold, I have never defiled myself; from my youth up till now I have never eaten what died of itself or was torn by beasts, nor has foul flesh come into my mouth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then he said to me, "See, I will let you have cow's dung instead of human dung, on which you may prepare your bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover he said to me, "Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem; they shall eat bread by weight and with fearfulness; and they shall drink water by measure and in dismay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>I will do this that they may lack bread and water, and look at one another in dismay, and waste away under their punishment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>"And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword; use it as a barber's razor and pass it over your head and your beard; then take balances for weighing, and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed; and a third part you shall take and strike with the sword round about the city; and a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>And you shall take from these a small number, and bind them in the skirts of your robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>And of these again you shall take some, and cast them into the fire, and burn them in the fire; from there a fire will come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus says the Lord GOD: This is Jerusalem; I have set her in the center of the nations, with countries round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she has wickedly rebelled against my ordinances more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries round about her, by rejecting my ordinances and not walking in my statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you are more turbulent than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes or kept my ordinances, but have acted according to the ordinances of the nations that are round about you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Behold, I, even I, am against you; and I will execute judgments in the midst of you in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And because of all your abominations I will do with you what I have never yet done, and the like of which I will never do again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore fathers shall eat their sons in the midst of you, and sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments on you, and any of you who survive I will scatter to all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Wherefore, as I live, says the Lord GOD, surely, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable things and with all your abominations, therefore I will cut you down; my eye will not spare, and I will have no pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of you shall die of pestilence and be consumed with famine in the midst of you; a third part shall fall by the sword round about you; and a third part I will scatter to all the winds and will unsheathe the sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>"Thus shall my anger spend itself, and I will vent my fury upon them and satisfy myself; and they shall know that I, the LORD, have spoken in my jealousy, when I spend my fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make you a desolation and an object of reproach among the nations round about you and in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>You shall be a reproach and a taunt, a warning and a horror, to the nations round about you, when I execute judgments on you in anger and fury, and with furious chastisements--I, the LORD, have spoken--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>when I loose against you my deadly arrows of famine, arrows for destruction, which I will loose to destroy you, and when I bring more and more famine upon you, and break your staff of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>I will send famine and wild beasts against you, and they will rob you of your children; pestilence and blood shall pass through you; and I will bring the sword upon you. I, the LORD, have spoken."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>The word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>"Son of man, set your face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>and say, You mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD! Thus says the Lord GOD to the mountains and the hills, to the ravines and the valleys: Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>Your altars shall become desolate, and your incense altars shall be broken; and I will cast down your slain before your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones round about your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>Wherever you dwell your cities shall be waste and your high places ruined, so that your altars will be waste and ruined, your idols broken and destroyed, your incense altars cut down, and your works wiped out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and you shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>"Yet I will leave some of you alive. When you have among the nations some who escape the sword, and when you are scattered through the countries,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>then those of you who escape will remember me among the nations where they are carried captive, when I have broken their wanton heart which has departed from me, and blinded their eyes which turn wantonly after their idols; and they will be loathsome in their own sight for the evils which they have committed, for all their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I am the LORD; I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus says the Lord GOD: "Clap your hands, and stamp your foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel; for they shall fall by the sword, by famine, and by pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He that is far off shall die of pestilence; and he that is near shall fall by the sword; and he that is left and is preserved shall die of famine. Thus I will spend my fury upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.13'>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when their slain lie among their idols round about their altars, upon every high hill, on all the mountain tops, under every green tree, and under every leafy oak, wherever they offered pleasing odor to all their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.14'>And I will stretch out my hand against them, and make the land desolate and waste, throughout all their habitations, from the wilderness to Riblah. Then they will know that I am the LORD."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>The word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>"And you, O son of man, thus says the Lord GOD to the land of Israel: An end! The end has come upon the four corners of the land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>In the sixth year, in the sixth month, on the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, with the elders of Judah sitting before me, the hand of the Lord GOD fell there upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>Then I beheld, and, lo, a form that had the appearance of a man; below what appeared to be his loins it was fire, and above his loins it was like the appearance of brightness, like gleaming bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>He put forth the form of a hand, and took me by a lock of my head; and the Spirit lifted me up between earth and heaven, and brought me in visions of God to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the gateway of the inner court that faces north, where was the seat of the image of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>And behold, the glory of the God of Israel was there, like the vision that I saw in the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>Then he said to me, "Son of man, lift up your eyes now in the direction of the north." So I lifted up my eyes toward the north, and behold, north of the altar gate, in the entrance, was this image of jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>And he said to me, "Son of man, do you see what they are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel are committing here, to drive me far from my sanctuary? But you will see still greater abominations."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>And he brought me to the door of the court; and when I looked, behold, there was a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>Then said he to me, "Son of man, dig in the wall"; and when I dug in the wall, lo, there was a door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.9'>And he said to me, "Go in, and see the vile abominations that they are committing here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>So I went in and saw; and there, portrayed upon the wall round about, were all kinds of creeping things, and loathsome beasts, and all the idols of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>And before them stood seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, with Ja-azani'ah the son of Shaphan standing among them. Each had his censer in his hand, and the smoke of the cloud of incense went up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>Then he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen what the elders of the house of Israel are doing in the dark, every man in his room of pictures? For they say, `The LORD does not see us, the LORD has forsaken the land.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.13'>He said also to me, "You will see still greater abominations which they commit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.14'>Then he brought me to the entrance of the north gate of the house of the LORD; and behold, there sat women weeping for Tammuz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.15'>Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? You will see still greater abominations than these."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the LORD; and behold, at the door of the temple of the LORD, between the porch and the altar, were about twenty-five men, with their backs to the temple of the LORD, and their faces toward the east, worshiping the sun toward the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>Then he said to me, "Have you seen this, O son of man? Is it too slight a thing for the house of Judah to commit the abominations which they commit here, that they should fill the land with violence, and provoke me further to anger? Lo, they put the branch to their nose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>Therefore I will deal in wrath; my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity; and though they cry in my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.1'>Then he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying, "Draw near, you executioners of the city, each with his destroying weapon in his hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.2'>And lo, six men came from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north, every man with his weapon for slaughter in his hand, and with them was a man clothed in linen, with a writing case at his side. And they went in and stood beside the bronze altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>Now the glory of the God of Israel had gone up from the cherubim on which it rested to the threshold of the house; and he called to the man clothed in linen, who had the writing case at his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.4'>And the LORD said to him, "Go through the city, through Jerusalem, and put a mark upon the foreheads of the men who sigh and groan over all the abominations that are committed in it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>And to the others he said in my hearing, "Pass through the city after him, and smite; your eye shall not spare, and you shall show no pity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>slay old men outright, young men and maidens, little children and women, but touch no one upon whom is the mark. And begin at my sanctuary." So they began with the elders who were before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>Then he said to them, "Defile the house, and fill the courts with the slain. Go forth." So they went forth, and smote in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>And while they were smiting, and I was left alone, I fell upon my face, and cried, "Ah Lord GOD! wilt thou destroy all that remains of Israel in the outpouring of thy wrath upon Jerusalem?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>Then he said to me, "The guilt of the house of Israel and Judah is exceedingly great; the land is full of blood, and the city full of injustice; for they say, `The LORD has forsaken the land, and the LORD does not see.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>As for me, my eye will not spare, nor will I have pity, but I will requite their deeds upon their heads."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.11'>And lo, the man clothed in linen, with the writing case at his side, brought back word, saying, "I have done as thou didst command me."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.1'>Then I looked, and behold, on the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubim there appeared above them something like a sapphire, in form resembling a throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.2'>And he said to the man clothed in linen, "Go in among the whirling wheels underneath the cherubim; fill your hands with burning coals from between the cherubim, and scatter them over the city."  And he went in before my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.3'>Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the house, when the man went in; and a cloud filled the inner court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.4'>And the glory of the LORD went up from the cherubim to the threshold of the house; and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was full of the brightness of the glory of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.5'>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard as far as the outer court, like the voice of God Almighty when he speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.6'>And when he commanded the man clothed in linen, "Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim," he went in and stood beside a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.7'>And a cherub stretched forth his hand from between the cherubim to the fire that was between the cherubim, and took some of it, and put it into the hands of the man clothed in linen, who took it and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.8'>The cherubim appeared to have the form of a human hand under their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.9'>And I looked, and behold, there were four wheels beside the cherubim, one beside each cherub; and the appearance of the wheels was like sparkling chrysolite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.10'>And as for their appearance, the four had the same likeness, as if a wheel were within a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.11'>When they went, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went, but in whatever direction the front wheel faced the others followed without turning as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.12'>And their rims, and their spokes, and the wheels were full of eyes round about--the wheels that the four of them had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.13'>As for the wheels, they were called in my hearing the whirling wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.14'>And every one had four faces: the first face was the face of the cherub, and the second face was the face of a man, and the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.15'>And the cherubim mounted up. These were the living creatures that I saw by the river Chebar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.16'>And when the cherubim went, the wheels went beside them; and when the cherubim lifted up their wings to mount up from the earth, the wheels did not turn from beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.17'>When they stood still, these stood still, and when they mounted up, these mounted up with them; for the spirit of the living creatures was in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.18'>Then the glory of the LORD went forth from the threshold of the house, and stood over the cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.19'>And the cherubim lifted up their wings and mounted up from the earth in my sight as they went forth, with the wheels beside them; and they stood at the door of the east gate of the house of the LORD; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.20'>These were the living creatures that I saw underneath the God of Israel by the river Chebar; and I knew that they were cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.21'>Each had four faces, and each four wings, and underneath their wings the semblance of human hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.22'>And as for the likeness of their faces, they were the very faces whose appearance I had seen by the river Chebar. They went every one straight forward.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.1'>The word of the LORD came to me again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.2'>"What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, `The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.3'>As I live, says the Lord GOD, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.4'>Behold, all souls are mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sins shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.5'>"If a man is righteous and does what is lawful and right--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.6'>if he does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman in her time of impurity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.7'>does not oppress any one, but restores to the debtor his pledge, commits no robbery, gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.8'>does not lend at interest or take any increase, withholds his hand from iniquity, executes true justice between man and man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.9'>walks in my statutes, and is careful to observe my ordinances--he is righteous, he shall surely live, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.10'>"If he begets a son who is a robber, a shedder of blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.11'>who does none of these duties, but eats upon the mountains, defiles his neighbor's wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.12'>oppresses the poor and needy, commits robbery, does not restore the pledge, lifts up his eyes to the idols, commits abomination,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.13'>lends at interest, and takes increase; shall he then live? He shall not live. He has done all these abominable things; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.14'>"But if this man begets a son who sees all the sins which his father has done, and fears, and does not do likewise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.15'>who does not eat upon the mountains or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, does not defile his neighbor's wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.16'>does not wrong any one, exacts no pledge, commits no robbery, but gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with a garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.17'>withholds his hand from iniquity, takes no interest or increase, observes my ordinances, and walks in my statutes; he shall not die for his father's iniquity; he shall surely live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.18'>As for his father, because he practiced extortion, robbed his brother, and did what is not good among his people, behold, he shall die for his iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.19'>"Yet you say, `Why should not the son suffer for the iniquity of the father?' When the son has done what is lawful and right, and has been careful to observe all my statutes, he shall surely live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.20'>The soul that sins shall die. The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the iniquity of the son; the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.21'>"But if a wicked man turns away from all his sins which he has committed and keeps all my statutes and does what is lawful and right, he shall surely live; he shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.22'>None of the transgressions which he has committed shall be remembered against him; for the righteousness which he has done he shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.23'>Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, says the Lord GOD, and not rather that he should turn from his way and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.24'>But when a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity and does the same abominable things that the wicked man does, shall he live? None of the righteous deeds which he has done shall be remembered; for the treachery of which he is guilty and the sin he has committed, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.25'>"Yet you say, `The way of the Lord is not just.' Hear now, O house of Israel: Is my way not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.26'>When a righteous man turns away from his righteousness and commits iniquity, he shall die for it; for the iniquity which he has committed he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.27'>Again, when a wicked man turns away from the wickedness he has committed and does what is lawful and right, he shall save his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.28'>Because he considered and turned away from all the transgressions which he had committed, he shall surely live, he shall not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.29'>Yet the house of Israel says, `The way of the Lord is not just.' O house of Israel, are my ways not just? Is it not your ways that are not just?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.30'>"Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord GOD. Repent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.31'>Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed against me, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.18.32'>For I have no pleasure in the death of any one, says the Lord GOD; so turn, and live."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.19'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.1'>And you, take up a lamentation for the princes of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.2'>and say: What a lioness was your mother among lions! She couched in the midst of young lions, rearing her whelps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.3'>And she brought up one of her whelps; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.4'>The nations sounded an alarm against him; he was taken in their pit; and they brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.5'>When she saw that she was baffled, that her hope was lost, she took another of her whelps and made him a young lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.6'>He prowled among the lions; he became a young lion, and he learned to catch prey; he devoured men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.7'>And he ravaged their strongholds, and laid waste their cities; and the land was appalled and all who were in it at the sound of his roaring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.8'>Then the nations set against him snares on every side; they spread their net over him; he was taken in their pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.9'>With hooks they put him in a cage, and brought him to the king of Babylon; they brought him into custody, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.10'>Your mother was like a vine in a vineyard transplanted by the water, fruitful and full of branches by reason of abundant water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.11'>Its strongest stem became a ruler's scepter; it towered aloft among the thick boughs; it was seen in its height with the mass of its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.12'>But the vine was plucked up in fury, cast down to the ground; the east wind dried it up; its fruit was stripped off, its strong stem was withered; the fire consumed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.13'>Now it is transplanted in the wilderness, in a dry and thirsty land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.19.14'>And fire has gone out from its stem, has consumed its branches and fruit, so that there remains in it no strong stem, no scepter for a ruler.  This is a lamentation, and has become a lamentation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.20'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.1'>In the seventh year, in the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month, certain of the elders of Israel came to inquire of the LORD, and sat before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.2'>And the word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.3'>"Son of man, speak to the elders of Israel, and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD, Is it to inquire of me that you come? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.4'>Will you judge them, son of man, will you judge them? Then let them know the abominations of their fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.5'>and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: On the day when I chose Israel, I swore to the seed of the house of Jacob, making myself known to them in the land of Egypt, I swore to them, saying, I am the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.6'>On that day I swore to them that I would bring them out of the land of Egypt into a land that I had searched out for them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.7'>And I said to them, Cast away the detestable things your eyes feast on, every one of you, and do not defile yourselves with the idols of Egypt; I am the LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.8'>But they rebelled against me and would not listen to me; they did not every man cast away the detestable things their eyes feasted on, nor did they forsake the idols of Egypt.  "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.9'>But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations among whom they dwelt, in whose sight I made myself known to them in bringing them out of the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.10'>So I led them out of the land of Egypt and brought them into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.11'>I gave them my statutes and showed them my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.12'>Moreover I gave them my sabbaths, as a sign between me and them, that they might know that I the LORD sanctify them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.13'>But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness; they did not walk in my statutes but rejected my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live; and my sabbaths they greatly profaned.  "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to make a full end of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.14'>But I acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.15'>Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would not bring them into the land which I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most glorious of all lands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.16'>because they rejected my ordinances and did not walk in my statutes, and profaned my sabbaths; for their heart went after their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.17'>Nevertheless my eye spared them, and I did not destroy them or make a full end of them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.18'>"And I said to their children in the wilderness, Do not walk in the statutes of your fathers, nor observe their ordinances, nor defile yourselves with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.19'>I the LORD am your God; walk in my statutes, and be careful to observe my ordinances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.20'>and hallow my sabbaths that they may be a sign between me and you, that you may know that I the LORD am your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.21'>But the children rebelled against me; they did not walk in my statutes, and were not careful to observe my ordinances, by whose observance man shall live; they profaned my sabbaths.  "Then I thought I would pour out my wrath upon them and spend my anger against them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.22'>But I withheld my hand, and acted for the sake of my name, that it should not be profaned in the sight of the nations, in whose sight I had brought them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.23'>Moreover I swore to them in the wilderness that I would scatter them among the nations and disperse them through the countries,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.24'>because they had not executed my ordinances, but had rejected my statutes and profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes were set on their fathers' idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.25'>Moreover I gave them statutes that were not good and ordinances by which they could not have life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.26'>and I defiled them through their very gifts in making them offer by fire all their first-born, that I might horrify them; I did it that they might know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.27'>"Therefore, son of man, speak to the house of Israel and say to them, Thus says the Lord GOD: In this again your fathers blasphemed me, by dealing treacherously with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.28'>For when I had brought them into the land which I swore to give them, then wherever they saw any high hill or any leafy tree, there they offered their sacrifices and presented the provocation of their offering; there they sent up their soothing odors, and there they poured out their drink offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.29'>(I said to them, What is the high place to which you go? So its name is called Bamah to this day.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.30'>Wherefore say to the house of Israel, Thus says the Lord GOD: Will you defile yourselves after the manner of your fathers and go astray after their detestable things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.31'>When you offer your gifts and sacrifice your sons by fire, you defile yourselves with all your idols to this day. And shall I be inquired of by you, O house of Israel? As I live, says the Lord GOD, I will not be inquired of by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.32'>"What is in your mind shall never happen--the thought, `Let us be like the nations, like the tribes of the countries, and worship wood and stone.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.33'>"As I live, says the Lord GOD, surely with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out, I will be king over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.34'>I will bring you out from the peoples and gather you out of the countries where you are scattered, with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.35'>and I will bring you into the wilderness of the peoples, and there I will enter into judgment with you face to face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.36'>As I entered into judgment with your fathers in the wilderness of the land of Egypt, so I will enter into judgment with you, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.37'>I will make you pass under the rod, and I will let you go in by number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.38'>I will purge out the rebels from among you, and those who transgress against me; I will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, but they shall not enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.39'>"As for you, O house of Israel, thus says the Lord GOD: Go serve every one of you his idols, now and hereafter, if you will not listen to me; but my holy name you shall no more profane with your gifts and your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.40'>"For on my holy mountain, the mountain height of Israel, says the Lord GOD, there all the house of Israel, all of them, shall serve me in the land; there I will accept them, and there I will require your contributions and the choicest of your gifts, with all your sacred offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.41'>As a pleasing odor I will accept you, when I bring you out from the peoples, and gather you out of the countries where you have been scattered; and I will manifest my holiness among you in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.42'>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I bring you into the land of Israel, the country which I swore to give to your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.43'>And there you shall remember your ways and all the doings with which you have polluted yourselves; and you shall loathe yourselves for all the evils that you have committed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.44'>And you shall know that I am the LORD, when I deal with you for my name's sake, not according to your evil ways, nor according to your corrupt doings, O house of Israel, says the Lord GOD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.45'>And the word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.46'>"Son of man, set your face toward the south, preach against the south, and prophesy against the forest land in the Negeb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.47'>say to the forest of the Negeb, Hear the word of the LORD: Thus says the Lord GOD, Behold, I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree; the blazing flame shall not be quenched, and all faces from south to north shall be scorched by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.48'>All flesh shall see that I the LORD have kindled it; it shall not be quenched."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.20.49'>Then I said, "Ah Lord GOD! they are saying of me, `Is he not a maker of allegories?'"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.21'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.1'>The word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.2'>"Son of man, set your face toward Jerusalem and preach against the sanctuaries; prophesy against the land of Israel</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.3'>and say to the land of Israel, Thus says the LORD: Behold, I am against you, and will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off from you both righteous and wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.4'>Because I will cut off from you both righteous and wicked, therefore my sword shall go out of its sheath against all flesh from south to north;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.5'>and all flesh shall know that I the LORD have drawn my sword out of its sheath; it shall not be sheathed again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.6'>Sigh therefore, son of man; sigh with breaking heart and bitter grief before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.7'>And when they say to you, `Why do you sigh?' you shall say, `Because of the tidings. When it comes, every heart will melt and all hands will be feeble, every spirit will faint and all knees will be weak as water. Behold, it comes and it will be fulfilled,'" says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.8'>And the word of the LORD came to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.9'>"Son of man, prophesy and say, Thus says the Lord, Say: A sword, a sword is sharpened and also polished,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.10'>sharpened for slaughter, polished to flash like lightning! Or do we make mirth? You have despised the rod, my son, with everything of wood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.11'>So the sword is given to be polished, that it may be handled; it is sharpened and polished to be given into the hand of the slayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.12'>Cry and wail, son of man, for it is against my people; it is against all the princes of Israel; they are delivered over to the sword with my people. Smite therefore upon your thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.13'>For it will not be a testing--what could it do if you despise the rod?" says the Lord GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.14'>"Prophesy therefore, son of man; clap your hands and let the sword come down twice, yea thrice, the sword for those to be slain; it is the sword for the great slaughter, which encompasses them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.15'>that their hearts may melt, and many fall at all their gates. I have given the glittering sword; ah! it is made like lightning, it is polished for slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.16'>Cut sharply to right and left where your edge is directed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.17'>I also will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury; I the LORD have spoken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.18'>The word of the LORD came to me again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.19'>"Son of man, mark two ways for the sword of the king of Babylon to come; both of them shall come forth from the same land. And make a signpost, make it at the head of the way to a city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.20'>mark a way for the sword to come to Rabbah of the Ammonites and to Judah and to Jerusalem the fortified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.21'>For the king of Babylon stands at the parting of the way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination; he shakes the arrows, he consults the teraphim, he looks at the liver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.22'>Into his right hand comes the lot for Jerusalem, to open the mouth with a cry, to lift up the voice with shouting, to set battering rams against the gates, to cast up mounds, to build siege towers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.23'>But to them it will seem like a false divination; they have sworn solemn oaths; but he brings their guilt to remembrance, that they may be captured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.21.24'>"Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: Because you have made your guilt to be remembered, in that your transgressions are uncovered, so that in all your doings your sins appear--because you have come to remembrance, you shall be taken in them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.22'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.1'>Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.3'>You shall say, Thus says the Lord GOD: A city that sheds blood in the midst of her, that her time may come, and that makes idols to defile herself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.4'>You have become guilty by the blood which you have shed, and defiled by the idols which you have made; and you have brought your day near, the appointed time of your years has come.

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.5'>Those who are near and those who are far from you will mock you, you infamous one, full of tumult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.6'>"Behold, the princes of Israel in you, every one according to his power, have been bent on shedding blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.7'>Father and mother are treated with contempt in you; the sojourner suffers extortion in your midst; the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.22.9'>There are men in you who slander to shed blood, and men in you who eat upon the mountains; men commit lewdness in your midst.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>She bestowed her harlotries upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them; and she defiled herself with all the idols of every one on whom she doted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>She did not give up her harlotry which she had practiced since her days in Egypt; for in her youth men had lain with her and handled her virgin bosom and poured out their lust upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Therefore I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>These uncovered her nakedness; they seized her sons and her daughters; and her they slew with the sword; and she became a byword among women, when judgment had been executed upon her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>But she carried her harlotry further; she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chalde'ans portrayed in vermilion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>girded with belts on their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looking like officers, a picture of Babylonians whose native land was Chalde'a.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.43'>"Then I said, Do not men now commit adultery when they practice harlotry with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.44'>For they have gone in to her, as men go in to a harlot. Thus they went in to Oho'lah and to Ohol'ibah to commit lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.45'>But righteous men shall pass judgment on them with the sentence of adulteresses, and with the sentence of women that shed blood; because they are adulteresses, and blood is upon their hands."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.46'>For thus says the Lord GOD: "Bring up a host against them, and make them an object of terror and a spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.47'>And the host shall stone them and dispatch them with their swords; they shall slay their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.48'>Thus will I put an end to lewdness in the land, that all women may take warning and not commit lewdness as you have done.</verse>

The priests shall offer his burnt offering and his peace offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate. Then he shall go out, but the gate shall not be shut until evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.3'>The people of the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate before the LORD on the sabbaths and on the new moons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.4'>The burnt offering that the prince offers to the LORD on the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish and a ram without blemish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.5'>and the cereal offering with the ram shall be an ephah, and the cereal offering with the lambs shall be as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.6'>On the day of the new moon he shall offer a young bull without blemish, and six lambs and a ram, which shall be without blemish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.7'>as a cereal offering he shall provide an ephah with the bull and an ephah with the ram, and with the lambs as much as he is able, together with a hin of oil to each ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.8'>When the prince enters, he shall go in by the vestibule of the gate, and he shall go out by the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.9'>"When the people of the land come before the LORD at the appointed feasts, he who enters by the north gate to worship shall go out by the south gate; and he who enters by the south gate shall go out by the north gate: no one shall return by way of the gate by which he entered, but each shall go out straight ahead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.10'>When they go in, the prince shall go in with them; and when they go out, he shall go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.11'>"At the feasts and the appointed seasons the cereal offering with a young bull shall be an ephah, and with a ram an ephah, and with the lambs as much as one is able to give, together with a hin of oil to an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.12'>When the prince provides a freewill offering, either a burnt offering or peace offerings as a freewill offering to the LORD, the gate facing east shall be opened for him; and he shall offer his burnt offering or his peace offerings as he does on the sabbath day. Then he shall go out, and after he has gone out the gate shall be shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.13'>"He shall provide a lamb a year old without blemish for a burnt offering to the LORD daily; morning by morning he shall provide it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.14'>And he shall provide a cereal offering with it morning by morning, one sixth of an ephah, and one third of a hin of oil to moisten the flour, as a cereal offering to the LORD; this is the ordinance for the continual burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.15'>Thus the lamb and the meal offering and the oil shall be provided, morning by morning, for a continual burnt offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.16'>"Thus says the Lord GOD: If the prince makes a gift to any of his sons out of his inheritance, it shall belong to his sons, it is their property by inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.17'>But if he makes a gift out of his inheritance to one of his servants, it shall be his to the year of liberty; then it shall revert to the prince; only his sons may keep a gift from his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.18'>The prince shall not take any of the inheritance of the people, thrusting them out of their property; he shall give his sons their inheritance out of his own property, so that none of my people shall be dispossessed of his property."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.19'>Then he brought me through the entrance, which was at the side of the gate, to the north row of the holy chambers for the priests; and there I saw a place at the extreme western end of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.20'>And he said to me, "This is the place where the priests shall boil the guilt offering and the sin offering, and where they shall bake the cereal offering, in order not to bring them out into the outer court and so communicate holiness to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.21'>Then he brought me forth to the outer court, and led me to the four corners of the court; and in each corner of the court there was a court--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.22'>in the four corners of the court were small courts, forty cubits long and thirty broad; the four were of the same size.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.23'>On the inside, around each of the four courts was a row of masonry, with hearths made at the bottom of the rows round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.46.24'>Then he said to me, "These are the kitchens where those who minister at the temple shall boil the sacrifices of the people."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.47'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.1'>Then he brought me back to the door of the temple; and behold, water was issuing from below the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east); and the water was flowing down from below the south end of the threshold of the temple, south of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.2'>Then he brought me out by way of the north gate, and led me round on the outside to the outer gate, that faces toward the east; and the water was coming out on the south side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.3'>Going on eastward with a line in his hand, the man measured a thousand cubits, and then led me through the water; and it was ankle-deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.4'>Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was knee-deep. Again he measured a thousand, and led me through the water; and it was up to the loins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.5'>Again he measured a thousand, and it was a river that I could not pass through, for the water had risen; it was deep enough to swim in, a river that could not be passed through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.6'>And he said to me, "Son of man, have you seen this?"  Then he led me back along the bank of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.7'>As I went back, I saw upon the bank of the river very many trees on the one side and on the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.8'>And he said to me, "This water flows toward the eastern region and goes down into the Arabah; and when it enters the stagnant waters of the sea, the water will become fresh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.9'>And wherever the river goes every living creature which swarms will live, and there will be very many fish; for this water goes there, that the waters of the sea may become fresh; so everything will live where the river goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.10'>Fishermen will stand beside the sea; from En-ge'di to En-eg'laim it will be a place for the spreading of nets; its fish will be of very many kinds, like the fish of the Great Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.11'>But its swamps and marshes will not become fresh; they are to be left for salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.12'>And on the banks, on both sides of the river, there will grow all kinds of trees for food. Their leaves will not wither nor their fruit fail, but they will bear fresh fruit every month, because the water for them flows from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food, and their leaves for healing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.13'>Thus says the Lord GOD: "These are the boundaries by which you shall divide the land for inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel. Joseph shall have two portions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.14'>And you shall divide it equally; I swore to give it to your fathers, and this land shall fall to you as your inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.15'>"This shall be the boundary of the land: On the north side, from the Great Sea by way of Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, and on to Zedad,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.17'>So the boundary shall run from the sea to Hazar-e'non, which is on the northern border of Damascus, with the border of Hamath to the north. This shall be the north side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.18'>"On the east side, the boundary shall run from Hazar-e'non between Hauran and Damascus; along the Jordan between Gilead and the land of Israel; to the eastern sea and as far as Tamar. This shall be the east side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.19'>"On the south side, it shall run from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-ka'desh, thence along the Brook of Egypt to the Great Sea. This shall be the south side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.20'>"On the west side, the Great Sea shall be the boundary to a point opposite the entrance of Hamath. This shall be the west side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.21'>"So you shall divide this land among you according to the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.22'>You shall allot it as an inheritance for yourselves and for the aliens who reside among you and have begotten children among you. They shall be to you as native-born sons of Israel; with you they shall be allotted an inheritance among the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.47.23'>In whatever tribe the alien resides, there you shall assign him his inheritance, says the Lord GOD.</verse>
