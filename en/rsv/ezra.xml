        <title>and his acts, first and last, behold, they are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>"Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth, and he has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Whoever is among you of all his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and rebuild the house of the LORD, the God of Israel-- he is the God who is in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>and let each survivor, in whatever place he sojourns, be assisted by the men of his place with silver and gold, with goods and with beasts, besides freewill offerings for the house of God which is in Jerusalem."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then rose up the heads of the fathers' houses of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests and the Levites, every one whose spirit God had stirred to go up to rebuild the house of the LORD which is in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>and all who were about them aided them with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, with beasts, and with costly wares, besides all that was freely offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>Cyrus the king also brought out the vessels of the house of the LORD which Nebuchadnez'zar had carried away from Jerusalem and placed in the house of his gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>Cyrus king of Persia brought these out in charge of Mith'redath the treasurer, who counted them out to Shesh-baz'zar the prince of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this was the number of them: a thousand basins of gold, a thousand basins of silver, twenty-nine censers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>thirty bowls of gold, two thousand four hundred and ten bowls of silver, and a thousand other vessels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.11'>all the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand four hundred and sixty-nine. All these did Shesh-baz'zar bring up, when the exiles were brought up from Babylonia to Jerusalem.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>When the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in the towns, the people gathered as one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then arose Jeshua the son of Jo'zadak, with his fellow priests, and Zerub'babel the son of She-al'ti-el with his kinsmen, and they built the altar of the God of Israel, to offer burnt offerings upon it, as it is written in the law of Moses the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>They set the altar in its place, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the lands, and they offered burnt offerings upon it to the LORD, burnt offerings morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they kept the feast of booths, as it is written, and offered the daily burnt offerings by number according to the ordinance, as each day required,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>and after that the continual burnt offerings, the offerings at the new moon and at all the appointed feasts of the LORD, and the offerings of every one who made a freewill offering to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt offerings to the LORD. But the foundation of the temple of the LORD was not yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>So they gave money to the masons and the carpenters, and food, drink, and oil to the Sido'nians and the Tyrians to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant which they had from Cyrus king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerub'babel the son of She-al'ti-el and Jeshua the son of Jo'zadak made a beginning, together with the rest of their brethren, the priests and the Levites and all who had come to Jerusalem from the captivity. They appointed the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to have the oversight of the work of the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>And Jeshua with his sons and his kinsmen, and Kad'mi-el and his sons, the sons of Judah, together took the oversight of the workmen in the house of God, along with the sons of Hen'adad and the Levites, their sons and kinsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the LORD, the priests in their vestments came forward with trumpets, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with cymbals, to praise the LORD, according to the directions of David king of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>and they sang responsively, praising and giving thanks to the LORD, "For he is good, for his steadfast love endures for ever toward Israel." And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of the house of the LORD was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers' houses, old men who had seen the first house, wept with a loud voice when they saw the foundation of this house being laid, though many shouted aloud for joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>so that the people could not distinguish the sound of the joyful shout from the sound of the people's weeping, for the people shouted with a great shout, and the sound was heard afar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the returned exiles were building a temple to the LORD, the God of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>they approached Zerub'babel and the heads of fathers' houses and said to them, "Let us build with you; for we worship your God as you do, and we have been sacrificing to him ever since the days of E'sar-had'don king of Assyria who brought us here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerub'babel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers' houses in Israel said to them, "You have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God; but we alone will build to the LORD, the God of Israel, as King Cyrus the king of Persia has commanded us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land discouraged the people of Judah, and made them afraid to build,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasu-e'rus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Ar-ta-xerx'es, Bishlam and Mith'redath and Tab'eel and the rest of their associates wrote to Ar-ta-xerx'es king of Persia; the letter was written in Aramaic and translated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the commander and Shim'shai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Ar-ta-xerx'es the king as follows--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>then wrote Rehum the commander, Shim'shai the scribe, and the rest of their associates, the judges, the governors, the officials, the Persians, the men of Erech, the Babylonians, the men of Susa, that is, the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnap'par deported and settled in the cities of Sama'ria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, and now</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>this is a copy of the letter that they sent-- "To Ar-ta-xerx'es the king: Your servants, the men of the province Beyond the River, send greeting. And now</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>be it known to the king that the Jews who came up from you to us have gone to Jerusalem. They are rebuilding that rebellious and wicked city; they are finishing the walls and repairing the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Now be it known to the king that, if this city is rebuilt and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and the royal revenue will be impaired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we eat the salt of the palace and it is not fitting for us to witness the king's dishonor, therefore we send and inform the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>in order that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers. You will find in the book of the records and learn that this city is a rebellious city, hurtful to kings and provinces, and that sedition was stirred up in it from of old. That was why this city was laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We make known to the king that, if this city is rebuilt and its walls finished, you will then have no possession in the province Beyond the River."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>The king sent an answer: "To Rehum the commander and Shim'shai the scribe and the rest of their associates who live in Sama'ria and in the rest of the province Beyond the River, greeting. And now</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>the letter which you sent to us has been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I made a decree, and search has been made, and it has been found that this city from of old has risen against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>And mighty kings have been over Jerusalem, who ruled over the whole province Beyond the River, to whom tribute, custom, and toll were paid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Therefore make a decree that these men be made to cease, and that this city be not rebuilt, until a decree is made by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>And take care not to be slack in this matter; why should damage grow to the hurt of the king?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Then, when the copy of King Ar-ta-xerx'es' letter was read before Rehum and Shim'shai the scribe and their associates, they went in haste to the Jews at Jerusalem and by force and power made them cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then the work on the house of God which is in Jerusalem stopped; and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Now the prophets, Haggai and Zechari'ah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then Zerub'babel the son of She-al'ti-el and Jeshua the son of Jo'zadak arose and began to rebuild the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time Tat'tenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and She'thar-boz'enai and their associates came to them and spoke to them thus, "Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>They also asked them this, "What are the names of the men who are building this building?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not stop them till a report should reach Darius and then answer be returned by letter concerning it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter which Tat'tenai the governor of the province Beyond the River and She'thar-boz'enai and his associates the governors who were in the province Beyond the River sent to Darius the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>they sent him a report, in which was written as follows: "To Darius the king, all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known to the king that we went to the province of Judah, to the house of the great God. It is being built with huge stones, and timber is laid in the walls; this work goes on diligently and prospers in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then we asked those elders and spoke to them thus, `Who gave you a decree to build this house and to finish this structure?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>We also asked them their names, for your information, that we might write down the names of the men at their head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And this was their reply to us: `We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the house that was built many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But because our fathers had angered the God of heaven, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnez'zar king of Babylon, the Chalde'an, who destroyed this house and carried away the people to Babylonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>However in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree that this house of God should be rebuilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.14'>And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnez'zar had taken out of the temple that was in Jerusalem and brought into the temple of Babylon, these Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they were delivered to one whose name was Shesh-baz'zar, whom he had made governor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.15'>and he said to him, "Take these vessels, go and put them in the temple which is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be rebuilt on its site."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.16'>Then this Shesh-baz'zar came and laid the foundations of the house of God which is in Jerusalem; and from that time until now it has been in building, and it is not yet finished.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.17'>Therefore, if it seem good to the king, let search be made in the royal archives there in Babylon, to see whether a decree was issued by Cyrus the king for the rebuilding of this house of God in Jerusalem. And let the king send us his pleasure in this matter."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.1'>Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in Babylonia, in the house of the archives where the documents were stored.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.20'>For the priests and the Levites had purified themselves together; all of them were clean. So they killed the passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.21'>it was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile, and also by every one who had joined them and separated himself from the pollutions of the peoples of the land to worship the LORD, the God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.13'>Of the sons of Adoni'kam, those who came later, their names being Eliph'elet, Jeu'el, and Shemai'ah, and with them sixty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.14'>Of the sons of Bigva'i, Uthai and Zaccur, and with them seventy men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.15'>I gathered them to the river that runs to Aha'va, and there we encamped three days. As I reviewed the people and the priests, I found there none of the sons of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.16'>Then I sent for Elie'zer, Ar'i-el, Shemai'ah, Elna'than, Jarib, Elna'than, Nathan, Zechari'ah, and Meshul'lam, leading men, and for Joi'arib and Elna'than, who were men of insight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.17'>and sent them to Iddo, the leading man at the place Casiphi'a, telling them what to say to Iddo and his brethren the temple servants at the place Casiphi'a, namely, to send us ministers for the house of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.18'>And by the good hand of our God upon us, they brought us a man of discretion, of the sons of Mahli the son of Levi, son of Israel, namely Sherebi'ah with his sons and kinsmen, eighteen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.19'>also Hashabi'ah and with him Jeshai'ah of the sons of Merar'i, with his kinsmen and their sons, twenty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.20'>besides two hundred and twenty of the temple servants, whom David and his officials had set apart to attend the Levites. These were all mentioned by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.21'>Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river Aha'va, that we might humble ourselves before our God, to seek from him a straight way for ourselves, our children, and all our goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.22'>For I was ashamed to ask the king for a band of soldiers and horsemen to protect us against the enemy on our way; since we had told the king, "The hand of our God is for good upon all that seek him, and the power of his wrath is against all that forsake him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.23'>So we fasted and besought our God for this, and he listened to our entreaty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.24'>Then I set apart twelve of the leading priests: Sherebi'ah, Hashabi'ah, and ten of their kinsmen with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.25'>And I weighed out to them the silver and the gold and the vessels, the offering for the house of our God which the king and his counselors and his lords and all Israel there present had offered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.26'>I weighed out into their hand six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels worth a hundred talents, and a hundred talents of gold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.27'>twenty bowls of gold worth a thousand darics, and two vessels of fine bright bronze as precious as gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.28'>And I said to them, "You are holy to the LORD, and the vessels are holy; and the silver and the gold are a freewill offering to the LORD, the God of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.29'>Guard them and keep them until you weigh them before the chief priests and the Levites and the heads of fathers' houses in Israel at Jerusalem, within the chambers of the house of the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.30'>So the priests and the Levites took over the weight of the silver and the gold and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem, to the house of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.31'>Then we departed from the river Aha'va on the twelfth day of the first month, to go to Jerusalem; the hand of our God was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy and from ambushes by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.32'>We came to Jerusalem, and there we remained three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.33'>On the fourth day, within the house of our God, the silver and the gold and the vessels were weighed into the hands of Mer'emoth the priest, son of Uri'ah, and with him was Elea'zar the son of Phin'ehas, and with them were the Levites, Jo'zabad the son of Jeshua and No-adi'ah the son of Bin'nui.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.34'>The whole was counted and weighed, and the weight of everything was recorded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.35'>At that time those who had come from captivity, the returned exiles, offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel, twelve bulls for all Israel, ninety-six rams, seventy-seven lambs, and as a sin offering twelve he-goats; all this was a burnt offering to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.36'>They also delivered the king's commissions to the king's satraps and to the governors of the province Beyond the River; and they aided the people and the house of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.1'>After these things had been done, the officials approached me and said, "The people of Israel and the priests and the Levites have not separated themselves from the peoples of the lands with their abominations, from the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Per'izzites, the Jeb'usites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.2'>For they have taken some of their daughters to be wives for themselves and for their sons; so that the holy race has mixed itself with the peoples of the lands. And in this faithlessness the hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.3'>When I heard this, I rent my garments and my mantle, and pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat appalled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.4'>Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel, because of the faithlessness of the returned exiles, gathered round me while I sat appalled until the evening sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.5'>And at the evening sacrifice I rose from my fasting, with my garments and my mantle rent, and fell upon my knees and spread out my hands to the LORD my God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.6'>saying:  "O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift my face to thee, my God, for our iniquities have risen higher than our heads, and our guilt has mounted up to the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.7'>From the days of our fathers to this day we have been in great guilt; and for our iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been given into the hand of the kings of the lands, to the sword, to captivity, to plundering, and to utter shame, as at this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.8'>But now for a brief moment favor has been shown by the LORD our God, to leave us a remnant, and to give us a secure hold within his holy place, that our God may brighten our eyes and grant us a little reviving in our bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.9'>For we are bondmen; yet our God has not forsaken us in our bondage, but has extended to us his steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God, to repair its ruins, and to give us protection in Judea and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.10'>"And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? For we have forsaken thy commandments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.11'>which thou didst command by thy servants the prophets, saying, `The land which you are entering, to take possession of it, is a land unclean with the pollutions of the peoples of the lands, with their abominations which have filled it from end to end with their uncleanness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.12'>Therefore give not your daughters to their sons, neither take their daughters for your sons, and never seek their peace or prosperity, that you may be strong, and eat the good of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children for ever.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.13'>And after all that has come upon us for our evil deeds and for our great guilt, seeing that thou, our God, hast punished us less than our iniquities deserved and hast given us such a remnant as this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.14'>shall we break thy commandments again and intermarry with the peoples who practice these abominations? Wouldst thou not be angry with us till thou wouldst consume us, so that there should be no remnant, nor any to escape?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.15'>O LORD the God of Israel, thou art just, for we are left a remnant that has escaped, as at this day. Behold, we are before thee in our guilt, for none can stand before thee because of this."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.1'>While Ezra prayed and made confession, weeping and casting himself down before the house of God, a very great assembly of men, women, and children, gathered to him out of Israel; for the people wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.2'>And Shecani'ah the son of Jehi'el, of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra: "We have broken faith with our God and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land, but even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.3'>Therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my lord and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.5'>Then Ezra arose and made the leading priests and Levites and all Israel take oath that they would do as had been said. So they took the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.6'>Then Ezra withdrew from before the house of God, and went to the chamber of Jehoha'nan the son of Eli'ashib, where he spent the night, neither eating bread nor drinking water; for he was mourning over the faithlessness of the exiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.7'>And a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem to all the returned exiles that they should assemble at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.8'>and that if any one did not come within three days, by order of the officials and the elders all his property should be forfeited, and he himself banned from the congregation of the exiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.9'>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin assembled at Jerusalem within the three days; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month. And all the people sat in the open square before the house of God, trembling because of this matter and because of the heavy rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.10'>And Ezra the priest stood up and said to them, "You have trespassed and married foreign women, and so increased the guilt of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.11'>Now then make confession to the LORD the God of your fathers, and do his will; separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from the foreign wives."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.12'>Then all the assembly answered with a loud voice, "It is so; we must do as you have said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.13'>But the people are many, and it is a time of heavy rain; we cannot stand in the open. Nor is this a work for one day or for two; for we have greatly transgressed in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.14'>Let our officials stand for the whole assembly; let all in our cities who have taken foreign wives come at appointed times, and with them the elders and judges of every city, till the fierce wrath of our God over this matter be averted from us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.15'>Only Jonathan the son of As'ahel and Jahzei'ah the son of Tikvah opposed this, and Meshul'lum and Shab'bethai the Levite supported them.</verse>
