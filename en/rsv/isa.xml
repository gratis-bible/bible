        <title>The mandrakes give forth fragrance, and over our doors are all choice fruits, new as well as old, which I have laid up for you, O my beloved.</title>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzzi'ah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezeki'ah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for the LORD has spoken: "Sons have I reared and brought up, but they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows its owner, and the ass its master's crib; but Israel does not know, my people does not understand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah, sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, offspring of evildoers, sons who deal corruptly! They have forsaken the LORD, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why will you still be smitten, that you continue to rebel? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even to the head, there is no soundness in it, but bruises and sores and bleeding wounds; they are not pressed out, or bound up, or softened with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country lies desolate, your cities are burned with fire; in your very presence aliens devour your land; it is desolate, as overthrown by aliens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, like a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>If the LORD of hosts had not left us a few survivors, we should have been like Sodom, and become like Gomor'rah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of the LORD, you rulers of Sodom! Give ear to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomor'rah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>"What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says the LORD; I have had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts; I do not delight in the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>"When you come to appear before me, who requires of you this trampling of my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain offerings; incense is an abomination to me. New moon and sabbath and the calling of assemblies-- I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates; they have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>When you spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you; even though you make many prayers, I will not listen; your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash yourselves; make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your doings from before my eyes; cease to do evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>learn to do good; seek justice, correct oppression; defend the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>"Come now, let us reason together, says the LORD: though your sins are like scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they are red like crimson, they shall become like wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if you refuse and rebel, you shall be devoured by the sword; for the mouth of the LORD has spoken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How the faithful city has become a harlot, she that was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Your silver has become dross, your wine mixed with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. Every one loves a bribe and runs after gifts. They do not defend the fatherless, and the widow's cause does not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore the Lord says, the LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel: "Ah, I will vent my wrath on my enemies, and avenge myself on my foes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>I will turn my hand against you and will smelt away your dross as with lye and remove all your alloy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you shall be called the city of righteousness, the faithful city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed by justice, and those in her who repent, by righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>But rebels and sinners shall be destroyed together, and those who forsake the LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For you shall be ashamed of the oaks in which you delighted; and you shall blush for the gardens which you have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For you shall be like an oak whose leaf withers, and like a garden without water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall become tow, and his work a spark, and both of them shall burn together, with none to quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word which Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>It shall come to pass in the latter days that the mountain of the house of the LORD shall be established as the highest of the mountains, and shall be raised above the hills; and all the nations shall flow to it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>and many peoples shall come, and say: "Come, let us go up to the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob; that he may teach us his ways and that we may walk in his paths." For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of the LORD from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>He shall judge between the nations, and shall decide for many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come, let us walk in the light of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For thou hast rejected thy people, the house of Jacob, because they are full of diviners from the east and of soothsayers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>So man is humbled, and men are brought low-- forgive them not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide in the dust from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The haughty looks of man shall be brought low, and the pride of men shall be humbled; and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For the LORD of hosts has a day against all that is proud and lofty, against all that is lifted up and high;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>against all the cedars of Lebanon, lofty and lifted up; and against all the oaks of Bashan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>against all the high mountains, and against all the lofty hills;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>against every high tower, and against every fortified wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>against all the ships of Tarshish, and against all the beautiful craft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the haughtiness of man shall be humbled, and the pride of men shall be brought low; and the LORD alone will be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols shall utterly pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And men shall enter the caves of the rocks and the holes of the ground, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day men will cast forth their idols of silver and their idols of gold, which they made for themselves to worship, to the moles and to the bats,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>to enter the caverns of the rocks and the clefts of the cliffs, from before the terror of the LORD, and from the glory of his majesty, when he rises to terrify the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Turn away from man in whose nostrils is breath, for of what account is he?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>the mighty man and the soldier, the judge and the prophet, the diviner and the elder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>the captain of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor and the skilful magician and the expert in charms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will make boys their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people will oppress one another, every man his fellow and every man his neighbor; the youth will be insolent to the elder, and the base fellow to the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man takes hold of his brother in the house of his father, saying: "You have a mantle; you shall be our leader, and this heap of ruins shall be under your rule";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>in that day he will speak out, saying: "I will not be a healer; in my house there is neither bread nor mantle; you shall not make me leader of the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen; because their speech and their deeds are against the LORD, defying his glorious presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>Their partiality witnesses against them; they proclaim their sin like Sodom, they do not hide it. Woe to them! For they have brought evil upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Tell the righteous that it shall be well with them, for they shall eat the fruit of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe to the wicked! It shall be ill with him, for what his hands have done shall be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>My people-- children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, your leaders mislead you, and confuse the course of your paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>The LORD has taken his place to contend, he stands to judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>The LORD enters into judgment with the elders and princes of his people: "It is you who have devoured the vineyard, the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What do you mean by crushing my people, by grinding the face of the poor?" says the Lord GOD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>The LORD said: Because the daughters of Zion are haughty and walk with outstretched necks, glancing wantonly with their eyes, mincing along as they go, tinkling with their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>the Lord will smite with a scab the heads of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will lay bare their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the finery of the anklets, the headbands, and the crescents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the pendants, the bracelets, and the scarfs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the headdresses, the armlets, the sashes, the perfume boxes, and the amulets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the signet rings and nose rings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the festal robes, the mantles, the cloaks, and the handbags;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>the garments of gauze, the linen garments, the turbans, and the veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>Instead of perfume there will be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a rich robe, a girding of sackcloth; instead of beauty, shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Your men shall fall by the sword and your mighty men in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn; ravaged, she shall sit upon the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, "We will eat our own bread and wear our own clothes, only let us be called by your name; take away our reproach."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day the branch of the LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And he who is left in Zion and remains in Jerusalem will be called holy, every one who has been recorded for life in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion and cleansed the bloodstains of Jerusalem from its midst by a spirit of judgment and by a spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>Then the LORD will create over the whole site of Mount Zion and over her assemblies a cloud by day, and smoke and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory there will be a canopy and a pavilion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>It will be for a shade by day from the heat, and for a refuge and a shelter from the storm and rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Let me sing for my beloved a love song concerning his vineyard: My beloved had a vineyard on a very fertile hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>He digged it and cleared it of stones, and planted it with choice vines; he built a watchtower in the midst of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; and he looked for it to yield grapes, but it yielded wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What more was there to do for my vineyard, that I have not done in it? When I looked for it to yield grapes, why did it yield wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will remove its hedge, and it shall be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it shall be trampled down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>I will make it a waste; it shall not be pruned or hoed, and briers and thorns shall grow up; I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are his pleasant planting; and he looked for justice, but behold, bloodshed; for righteousness, but behold, a cry!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe to those who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is no more room, and you are made to dwell alone in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>The LORD of hosts has sworn in my hearing: "Surely many houses shall be desolate, large and beautiful houses, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield but one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield but an ephah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe to those who rise early in the morning, that they may run after strong drink, who tarry late into the evening till wine inflames them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>They have lyre and harp, timbrel and flute and wine at their feasts; but they do not regard the deeds of the LORD, or see the work of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people go into exile for want of knowledge; their honored men are dying of hunger, and their multitude is parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth beyond measure, and the nobility of Jerusalem and her multitude go down, her throng and he who exults in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>Man is bowed down, and men are brought low, and the eyes of the haughty are humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But the LORD of hosts is exalted in justice, and the Holy God shows himself holy in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the lambs graze as in their pasture, fatlings and kids shall feed among the ruins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, who draw sin as with cart ropes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>who say: "Let him make haste, let him speed his work that we may see it; let the purpose of the Holy One of Israel draw near, and let it come, that we may know it!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put darkness for light and light for darkness, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe to those who are wise in their own eyes, and shrewd in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe to those who are heroes at drinking wine, and valiant men in mixing strong drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of his right!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom go up like dust; for they have rejected the law of the LORD of hosts, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against his people, and he stretched out his hand against them and smote them, and the mountains quaked; and their corpses were as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>He will raise a signal for a nation afar off, and whistle for it from the ends of the earth; and lo, swiftly, speedily it comes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None is weary, none stumbles, none slumbers or sleeps, not a waistcloth is loose, not a sandal-thong broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>their arrows are sharp, all their bows bent, their horses' hoofs seem like flint, and their wheels like the whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring is like a lion, like young lions they roar; they growl and seize their prey, they carry it off, and none can rescue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>They will growl over it on that day, like the roaring of the sea. And if one look to the land, behold, darkness and distress; and the light is darkened by its clouds.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that King Uzzi'ah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above him stood the seraphim; each had six wings: with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one called to another and said: "Holy, holy, holy is the LORD of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who called, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>And I said: "Woe is me! For I am lost; for I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips; for my eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then flew one of the seraphim to me, having in his hand a burning coal which he had taken with tongs from the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>And he touched my mouth, and said: "Behold, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away, and your sin forgiven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, "Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?" Then I said, "Here am I! Send me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And he said, "Go, and say to this people: `Hear and hear, but do not understand; see and see, but do not perceive.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then I said, "How long, O Lord?" And he said: "Until cities lie waste without inhabitant, and houses without men, and the land is utterly desolate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>and the LORD removes men far away, and the forsaken places are many in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.13'>And though a tenth remain in it, it will be burned again, like a terebinth or an oak, whose stump remains standing when it is felled." The holy seed is its stump.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.7'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.1'>In the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, son of Uzzi'ah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Syria and Pekah the son of Remali'ah the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but they could not conquer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'>When the house of David was told, "Syria is in league with E'phraim," his heart and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.3'>And the LORD said to Isaiah, "Go forth to meet Ahaz, you and She'ar-jash'ub your son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the Fuller's Field,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.4'>and say to him, `Take heed, be quiet, do not fear, and do not let your heart be faint because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria and the son of Remali'ah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.5'>Because Syria, with E'phraim and the son of Remali'ah, has devised evil against you, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.6'>"Let us go up against Judah and terrify it, and let us conquer it for ourselves, and set up the son of Ta'be-el as king in the midst of it,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.7'>thus says the Lord GOD: It shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.8'>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. (Within sixty-five years E'phraim will be broken to pieces so that it will no longer be a people.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.9'>And the head of E'phraim is Sama'ria, and the head of Sama'ria is the son of Remali'ah. If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.10'>Again the LORD spoke to Ahaz,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.11'>"Ask a sign of the LORD your God; let it be deep as Sheol or high as heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.12'>But Ahaz said, "I will not ask, and I will not put the LORD to the test."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.13'>And he said, "Hear then, O house of David! Is it too little for you to weary men, that you weary my God also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.14'>Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, a young woman shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Imman'u-el.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.15'>He shall eat curds and honey when he knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.16'>For before the child knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land before whose two kings you are in dread will be deserted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.17'>The LORD will bring upon you and upon your people and upon your father's house such days as have not come since the day that E'phraim departed from Judah-- the king of Assyria."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.18'>In that day the LORD will whistle for the fly which is at the sources of the streams of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.19'>And they will all come and settle in the steep ravines, and in the clefts of the rocks, and on all the thornbushes, and on all the pastures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.20'>In that day the Lord will shave with a razor which is hired beyond the River-- with the king of Assyria-- the head and the hair of the feet, and it will sweep away the beard also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.21'>In that day a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.22'>and because of the abundance of milk which they give, he will eat curds; for every one that is left in the land will eat curds and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.23'>In that day every place where there used to be a thousand vines, worth a thousand shekels of silver, will become briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.24'>With bow and arrows men will come there, for all the land will be briers and thorns;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.25'>and as for all the hills which used to be hoed with a hoe, you will not come there for fear of briers and thorns; but they will become a place where cattle are let loose and where sheep tread.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.8'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.1'>Then the LORD said to me, "Take a large tablet and write upon it in common characters, `Belonging to Ma'her-shal'al-hash-baz.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.2'>And I got reliable witnesses, Uri'ah the priest and Zechari'ah the son of Jeberechi'ah, to attest for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.3'>And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. Then the LORD said to me, "Call his name Ma'her-shal'al-hash-baz;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.4'>for before the child knows how to cry `My father' or `My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Sama'ria will be carried away before the king of Assyria."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.5'>The LORD spoke to me again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.6'>"Because this people have refused the waters of Shilo'ah that flow gently, and melt in fear before Rezin and the son of Remali'ah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.7'>therefore, behold, the Lord is bringing up against them the waters of the River, mighty and many, the king of Assyria and all his glory; and it will rise over all its channels and go over all its banks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.8'>and it will sweep on into Judah, it will overflow and pass on, reaching even to the neck; and its outspread wings will fill the breadth of your land, O Imman'u-el."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.9'>Be broken, you peoples, and be dismayed; give ear, all you far countries; gird yourselves and be dismayed; gird yourselves and be dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.10'>Take counsel together, but it will come to nought; speak a word, but it will not stand, for God is with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.11'>For the LORD spoke thus to me with his strong hand upon me, and warned me not to walk in the way of this people, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.12'>"Do not call conspiracy all that this people call conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear, nor be in dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.13'>But the LORD of hosts, him you shall regard as holy; let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.14'>And he will become a sanctuary, and a stone of offense, and a rock of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.15'>And many shall stumble thereon; they shall fall and be broken; they shall be snared and taken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.16'>Bind up the testimony, seal the teaching among my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.17'>I will wait for the LORD, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will hope in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.18'>Behold, I and the children whom the LORD has given me are signs and portents in Israel from the LORD of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.19'>And when they say to you, "Consult the mediums and the wizards who chirp and mutter," should not a people consult their God? Should they consult the dead on behalf of the living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.20'>To the teaching and to the testimony! Surely for this word which they speak there is no dawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.21'>They will pass through the land, greatly distressed and hungry; and when they are hungry, they will be enraged and will curse their king and their God, and turn their faces upward;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.22'>and they will look to the earth, but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish; and they will be thrust into thick darkness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.9'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.1'>But there will be no gloom for her that was in anguish. In the former time he brought into contempt the land of Zeb'ulun and the land of Naph'tali, but in the latter time he will make glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.2'>The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.3'>Thou hast multiplied the nation, thou hast increased its joy; they rejoice before thee as with joy at the harvest, as men rejoice when they divide the spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.4'>For the yoke of his burden, and the staff for his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, thou hast broken as on the day of Mid'ian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.5'>For every boot of the tramping warrior in battle tumult and every garment rolled in blood will be burned as fuel for the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.6'>For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government will be upon his shoulder, and his name will be called "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.7'>Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and for evermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.8'>The Lord has sent a word against Jacob, and it will light upon Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.9'>and all the people will know, E'phraim and the inhabitants of Sama'ria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.10'>"The bricks have fallen, but we will build with dressed stones; the sycamores have been cut down, but we will put cedars in their place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.11'>So the LORD raises adversaries against them, and stirs up their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.12'>The Syrians on the east and the Philistines on the west devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.13'>The people did not turn to him who smote them, nor seek the LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.14'>So the LORD cut off from Israel head and tail, palm branch and reed in one day--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.15'>the elder and honored man is the head, and the prophet who teaches lies is the tail;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.16'>for those who lead this people lead them astray, and those who are led by them are swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.17'>Therefore the Lord does not rejoice over their young men, and has no compassion on their fatherless and widows; for every one is godless and an evildoer, and every mouth speaks folly. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.18'>For wickedness burns like a fire, it consumes briers and thorns; it kindles the thickets of the forest, and they roll upward in a column of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.19'>Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts the land is burned, and the people are like fuel for the fire; no man spares his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.20'>They snatch on the right, but are still hungry, and they devour on the left, but are not satisfied; each devours his neighbor's flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.21'>Manas'seh E'phraim, and E'phraim Manas'seh, and together they are against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.10'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.1'>Woe to those who decree iniquitous decrees, and the writers who keep writing oppression,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.2'>to turn aside the needy from justice and to rob the poor of my people of their right, that widows may be their spoil, and that they may make the fatherless their prey!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.3'>What will you do on the day of punishment, in the storm which will come from afar? To whom will you flee for help, and where will you leave your wealth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.4'>Nothing remains but to crouch among the prisoners or fall among the slain. For all this his anger is not turned away and his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.5'>Ah, Assyria, the rod of my anger, the staff of my fury!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.6'>Against a godless nation I send him, and against the people of my wrath I command him, to take spoil and seize plunder, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.7'>But he does not so intend, and his mind does not so think; but it is in his mind to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.8'>for he says: "Are not my commanders all kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.9'>Is not Calno like Car'chemish? Is not Hamath like Arpad? Is not Sama'ria like Damascus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.10'>As my hand has reached to the kingdoms of the idols whose graven images were greater than those of Jerusalem and Sama'ria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.11'>shall I not do to Jerusalem and her idols as I have done to Sama'ria and her images?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.12'>When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem he will punish the arrogant boasting of the king of Assyria and his haughty pride.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.13'>For he says: "By the strength of my hand I have done it, and by my wisdom, for I have understanding; I have removed the boundaries of peoples, and have plundered their treasures; like a bull I have brought down those who sat on thrones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.14'>My hand has found like a nest the wealth of the peoples; and as men gather eggs that have been forsaken so I have gathered all the earth; and there was none that moved a wing, or opened the mouth, or chirped."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.15'>Shall the axe vaunt itself over him who hews with it, or the saw magnify itself against him who wields it? As if a rod should wield him who lifts it, or as if a staff should lift him who is not wood!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.16'>Therefore the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will send wasting sickness among his stout warriors, and under his glory a burning will be kindled, like the burning of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.17'>The light of Israel will become a fire, and his Holy One a flame; and it will burn and devour his thorns and briers in one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.18'>The glory of his forest and of his fruitful land the LORD will destroy, both soul and body, and it will be as when a sick man wastes away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.19'>The remnant of the trees of his forest will be so few that a child can write them down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.20'>In that day the remnant of Israel and the survivors of the house of Jacob will no more lean upon him that smote them, but will lean upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.21'>A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.22'>For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return. Destruction is decreed, overflowing with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.23'>For the Lord, the LORD of hosts, will make a full end, as decreed, in the midst of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.24'>Therefore thus says the Lord, the LORD of hosts: "O my people, who dwell in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrians when they smite with the rod and lift up their staff against you as the Egyptians did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.25'>For in a very little while my indignation will come to an end, and my anger will be directed to their destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.26'>And the LORD of hosts will wield against them a scourge, as when he smote Mid'ian at the rock of Oreb; and his rod will be over the sea, and he will lift it as he did in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.27'>And in that day his burden will depart from your shoulder, and his yoke will be destroyed from your neck."  He has gone up from Rimmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.28'>he has come to Ai'ath; he has passed through Migron, at Michmash he stores his baggage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.29'>they have crossed over the pass, at Geba they lodge for the night; Ramah trembles, Gib'e-ah of Saul has fled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.10.32'>This very day he will halt at Nob, he will shake his fist at the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.33'>Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts will lop the boughs with terrifying power; the great in height will be hewn down, and the lofty will be brought low.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.10.34'>He will cut down the thickets of the forest with an axe, and Lebanon with its majestic trees will fall.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.48.2'>For they call themselves after the holy city, and stay themselves on the God of Israel; the LORD of hosts is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.48.3'>"The former things I declared of old, they went forth from my mouth and I made them known; then suddenly I did them and they came to pass.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.48.8'>You have never heard, you have never known, from of old your ear has not been opened. For I knew that you would deal very treacherously, and that from birth you were called a rebel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.49.1'>Listen to me, O coastlands, and hearken, you peoples from afar. The LORD called me from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.63.14'>Like cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD gave them rest. So thou didst lead thy people, to make for thyself a glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.15'>Look down from heaven and see, from thy holy and glorious habitation. Where are thy zeal and thy might? The yearning of thy heart and thy compassion are withheld from me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.64.1'>O that thou wouldst rend the heavens and come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.2'>as when fire kindles brushwood and the fire causes water to boil-- to make thy name known to thy adversaries, and that the nations might tremble at thy presence!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.3'>When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou camest down, the mountains quaked at thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.4'>From of old no one has heard or perceived by the ear, no eye has seen a God besides thee, who works for those who wait for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.5'>Thou meetest him that joyfully works righteousness, those that remember thee in thy ways. Behold, thou wast angry, and we sinned; in our sins we have been a long time, and shall we be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.6'>We have all become like one who is unclean, and all our righteous deeds are like a polluted garment. We all fade like a leaf, and our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.65'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.1'>I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, "Here am I, here am I," to a nation that did not call on my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.2'>I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.3'>a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens and burning incense upon bricks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.4'>who sit in tombs, and spend the night in secret places; who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.5'>who say, "Keep to yourself, do not come near me, for I am set apart from you." These are a smoke in my nostrils, a fire that burns all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.6'>Behold, it is written before me: "I will not keep silent, but I will repay, yea, I will repay into their bosom</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.7'>their iniquities and their fathers' iniquities together, says the LORD; because they burned incense upon the mountains and reviled me upon the hills, I will measure into their bosom payment for their former doings."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'>Thus says the LORD: "As the wine is found in the cluster, and they say, `Do not destroy it, for there is a blessing in it,' so I will do for my servants' sake, and not destroy them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'>I will bring forth descendants from Jacob, and from Judah inheritors of my mountains; my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.10'>Sharon shall become a pasture for flocks, and the Valley of Achor a place for herds to lie down, for my people who have sought me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.11'>But you who forsake the LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who set a table for Fortune and fill cups of mixed wine for Destiny;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.12'>I will destine you to the sword, and all of you shall bow down to the slaughter; because, when I called, you did not answer, when I spoke, you did not listen, but you did what was evil in my eyes, and chose what I did not delight in."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'>Therefore thus says the Lord GOD: "Behold, my servants shall eat, but you shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall drink, but you shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall rejoice, but you shall be put to shame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'>behold, my servants shall sing for gladness of heart, but you shall cry out for pain of heart, and shall wail for anguish of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.15'>You shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse, and the Lord GOD will slay you; but his servants he will call by a different name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.16'>So that he who blesses himself in the land shall bless himself by the God of truth, and he who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are forgotten and are hid from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.17'>"For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the former things shall not be remembered or come into mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.18'>But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create; for behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.19'>I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and be glad in my people; no more shall be heard in it the sound of weeping and the cry of distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.20'>No more shall there be in it an infant that lives but a few days, or an old man who does not fill out his days, for the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner a hundred years old shall be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.21'>They shall build houses and inhabit them; they shall plant vineyards and eat their fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.22'>They shall not build and another inhabit; they shall not plant and another eat; for like the days of a tree shall the days of my people be, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.23'>They shall not labor in vain, or bear children for calamity; for they shall be the offspring of the blessed of the LORD, and their children with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.24'>Before they call I will answer, while they are yet speaking I will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.25'>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, the lion shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, says the LORD."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'>Thus says the LORD: "Heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool; what is the house which you would build for me, and what is the place of my rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'>All these things my hand has made, and so all these things are mine, says the LORD. But this is the man to whom I will look, he that is humble and contrite in spirit, and trembles at my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>"He who slaughters an ox is like him who kills a man; he who sacrifices a lamb, like him who breaks a dog's neck; he who presents a cereal offering, like him who offers swine's blood; he who makes a memorial offering of frankincense, like him who blesses an idol. These have chosen their own ways, and their soul delights in their abominations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>I also will choose affliction for them, and bring their fears upon them; because, when I called, no one answered, when I spoke they did not listen; but they did what was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the word of the LORD, you who tremble at his word: "Your brethren who hate you and cast you out for my name's sake have said, `Let the LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy'; but it is they who shall be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'>"Hark, an uproar from the city! A voice from the temple! The voice of the LORD, rendering recompense to his enemies!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>"Before she was in labor she gave birth; before her pain came upon her she was delivered of a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth in one moment? For as soon as Zion was in labor she brought forth her sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'>Shall I bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth? says the LORD; shall I, who cause to bring forth, shut the womb? says your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'>"Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all you who love her; rejoice with her in joy, all you who mourn over her;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'>that you may suck and be satisfied with her consoling breasts; that you may drink deeply with delight from the abundance of her glory."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>For thus says the LORD: "Behold, I will extend prosperity to her like a river, and the wealth of the nations like an overflowing stream; and you shall suck, you shall be carried upon her hip, and dandled upon her knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you; you shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice; your bones shall flourish like the grass; and it shall be known that the hand of the LORD is with his servants, and his indignation is against his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>"For behold, the LORD will come in fire, and his chariots like the stormwind, to render his anger in fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'>For by fire will the LORD execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh; and those slain by the LORD shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>"Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens, following one in the midst, eating swine's flesh and the abomination and mice, shall come to an end together, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>"For I know their works and their thoughts, and I am coming to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come and shall see my glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>and I will set a sign among them. And from them I will send survivors to the nations, to Tarshish, Put, and Lud, who draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the coastlands afar off, that have not heard my fame or seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>And they shall bring all your brethren from all the nations as an offering to the LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says the LORD, just as the Israelites bring their cereal offering in a clean vessel to the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>And some of them also I will take for priests and for Levites, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>"For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make shall remain before me, says the LORD; so shall your descendants and your name remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'>From new moon to new moon, and from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'>"And they shall go forth and look on the dead bodies of the men that have rebelled against me; for their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh."</verse>
