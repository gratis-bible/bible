      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <title>"Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days; but in his son's days I will bring the evil upon his house."</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>After the death of Ahab, Moab rebelled against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>Now Ahazi'ah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber in Sama'ria, and lay sick; so he sent messengers, telling them, "Go, inquire of Ba'al-ze'bub, the god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of the LORD said to Eli'jah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Sama'ria, and say to them, `Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are going to inquire of Ba'al-ze'bub, the god of Ekron?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore thus says the LORD, `You shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die.'" So Eli'jah went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>The messengers returned to the king, and he said to them, "Why have you returned?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said to him, "There came a man to meet us, and said to us, `Go back to the king who sent you, and say to him, Thus says the LORD, Is it because there is no God in Israel that you are sending to inquire of Ba'al-ze'bub, the god of Ekron? Therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone, but shall surely die.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>He said to them, "What kind of man was he who came to meet you and told you these things?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>They answered him, "He wore a garment of haircloth, with a girdle of leather about his loins." And he said, "It is Eli'jah the Tishbite."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty men with his fifty. He went up to Eli'jah, who was sitting on the top of a hill, and said to him, "O man of God, the king says, `Come down.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>But Eli'jah answered the captain of fifty, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then fire came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Again the king sent to him another captain of fifty men with his fifty. And he went up and said to him, "O man of God, this is the king's order, `Come down quickly!'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>But Eli'jah answered them, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and consume you and your fifty." Then the fire of God came down from heaven and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>Again the king sent the captain of a third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Eli'jah, and entreated him, "O man of God, I pray you, let my life, and the life of these fifty servants of yours, be precious in your sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Lo, fire came down from heaven, and consumed the two former captains of fifty men with their fifties; but now let my life be precious in your sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>Then the angel of the LORD said to Eli'jah, "Go down with him; do not be afraid of him." So he arose and went down with him to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>and said to him, "Thus says the LORD, `Because you have sent messengers to inquire of Ba'al-ze'bub, the god of Ekron,--is it because there is no God in Israel to inquire of his word?--therefore you shall not come down from the bed to which you have gone, but you shall surely die.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Eli'jah had spoken. Jeho'ram, his brother, became king in his stead in the second year of Jeho'ram the son of Jehosh'aphat, king of Judah, because Ahazi'ah had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahazi'ah which he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>Now when the LORD was about to take Eli'jah up to heaven by a whirlwind, Eli'jah and Eli'sha were on their way from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Eli'jah said to Eli'sha, "Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me as far as Bethel." But Eli'sha said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came out to Eli'sha, and said to him, "Do you know that today the LORD will take away your master from over you?" And he said, "Yes, I know it; hold your peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>Eli'jah said to him, "Eli'sha, tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to Jericho." But he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>The sons of the prophets who were at Jericho drew near to Eli'sha, and said to him, "Do you know that today the LORD will take away your master from over you?" And he answered, "Yes, I know it; hold your peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>Then Eli'jah said to him, "Tarry here, I pray you; for the LORD has sent me to the Jordan." But he said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So the two of them went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>Fifty men of the sons of the prophets also went, and stood at some distance from them, as they both were standing by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>Then Eli'jah took his mantle, and rolled it up, and struck the water, and the water was parted to the one side and to the other, till the two of them could go over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>When they had crossed, Eli'jah said to Eli'sha, "Ask what I shall do for you, before I am taken from you." And Eli'sha said, "I pray you, let me inherit a double share of your spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, "You have asked a hard thing; yet, if you see me as I am being taken from you, it shall be so for you; but if you do not see me, it shall not be so."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And as they still went on and talked, behold, a chariot of fire and horses of fire separated the two of them. And Eli'jah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Eli'sha saw it and he cried, "My father, my father! the chariots of Israel and its horsemen!" And he saw him no more.  Then he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>And he took up the mantle of Eli'jah that had fallen from him, and went back and stood on the bank of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>Then he took the mantle of Eli'jah that had fallen from him, and struck the water, saying, "Where is the LORD, the God of Eli'jah?" And when he had struck the water, the water was parted to the one side and to the other; and Eli'sha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>Now when the sons of the prophets who were at Jericho saw him over against them, they said, "The spirit of Eli'jah rests on Eli'sha." And they came to meet him, and bowed to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said to him, "Behold now, there are with your servants fifty strong men; pray, let them go, and seek your master; it may be that the Spirit of the LORD has caught him up and cast him upon some mountain or into some valley." And he said, "You shall not send."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>But when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, "Send." They sent therefore fifty men; and for three days they sought him but did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho, and he said to them, "Did I not say to you, Do not go?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>Now the men of the city said to Eli'sha, "Behold, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord sees; but the water is bad, and the land is unfruitful."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>He said, "Bring me a new bowl, and put salt in it." So they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>Then he went to the spring of water and threw salt in it, and said, "Thus says the LORD, I have made this water wholesome; henceforth neither death nor miscarriage shall come from it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the water has been wholesome to this day, according to the word which Eli'sha spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>He went up from there to Bethel; and while he was going up on the way, some small boys came out of the city and jeered at him, saying, "Go up, you baldhead! Go up, you baldhead!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned around, and when he saw them, he cursed them in the name of the LORD. And two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>From there he went on to Mount Carmel, and thence he returned to Sama'ria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>In the eighteenth year of Jehosh'aphat king of Judah, Jeho'ram the son of Ahab became king over Israel in Sama'ria, and he reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, though not like his father and mother, for he put away the pillar of Ba'al which his father had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he clung to the sin of Jerobo'am the son of Nebat, which he made Israel to sin; he did not depart from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>Now Mesha king of Moab was a sheep breeder; and he had to deliver annually to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and the wool of a hundred thousand rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But when Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>So King Jeho'ram marched out of Sama'ria at that time and mustered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent word to Jehosh'aphat king of Judah, "The king of Moab has rebelled against me; will you go with me to battle against Moab?" And he said, "I will go; I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>Then he said, "By which way shall we march?" Jeho'ram answered, "By the way of the wilderness of Edom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went with the king of Judah and the king of Edom. And when they had made a circuitous march of seven days, there was no water for the army or for the beasts which followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>Then the king of Israel said, "Alas! The LORD has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>And Jehosh'aphat said, "Is there no prophet of the LORD here, through whom we may inquire of the LORD?" Then one of the king of Israel's servants answered, "Eli'sha the son of Shaphat is here, who poured water on the hands of Eli'jah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehosh'aphat said, "The word of the LORD is with him." So the king of Israel and Jehosh'aphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Eli'sha said to the king of Israel, "What have I to do with you? Go to the prophets of your father and the prophets of your mother." But the king of Israel said to him, "No; it is the LORD who has called these three kings to give them into the hand of Moab."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Eli'sha said, "As the LORD of hosts lives, whom I serve, were it not that I have regard for Jehosh'aphat the king of Judah, I would neither look at you, nor see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel." And when the minstrel played, the power of the LORD came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, "Thus says the LORD, `I will make this dry stream-bed full of pools.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus says the LORD, `You shall not see wind or rain, but that stream-bed shall be filled with water, so that you shall drink, you, your cattle, and your beasts.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>This is a light thing in the sight of the LORD; he will also give the Moabites into your hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>and you shall conquer every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop up all springs of water, and ruin every good piece of land with stones."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>The next morning, about the time of offering the sacrifice, behold, water came from the direction of Edom, till the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>When all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to fight against them, all who were able to put on armor, from the youngest to the oldest, were called out, and were drawn up at the frontier.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And when they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, the Moabites saw the water opposite them as red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, "This is blood; the kings have surely fought together, and slain one another. Now then, Moab, to the spoil!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>But when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and attacked the Moabites, till they fled before them; and they went forward, slaughtering the Moabites as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they overthrew the cities, and on every good piece of land every man threw a stone, until it was covered; they stopped every spring of water, and felled all the good trees; till only its stones were left in Kir-har'eseth, and the slingers surrounded and conquered it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>When the king of Moab saw that the battle was going against him, he took with him seven hundred swordsmen to break through, opposite the king of Edom; but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his eldest son who was to reign in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there came great wrath upon Israel; and they withdrew from him and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now the wife of one of the sons of the prophets cried to Eli'sha, "Your servant my husband is dead; and you know that your servant feared the LORD, but the creditor has come to take my two children to be his slaves."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Eli'sha said to her, "What shall I do for you? Tell me; what have you in the house?" And she said, "Your maidservant has nothing in the house, except a jar of oil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>Then he said, "Go outside, borrow vessels of all your neighbors, empty vessels and not too few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>Then go in, and shut the door upon yourself and your sons, and pour into all these vessels; and when one is full, set it aside."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him and shut the door upon herself and her sons; and as she poured they brought the vessels to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>When the vessels were full, she said to her son, "Bring me another vessel." And he said to her, "There is not another." Then the oil stopped flowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>She came and told the man of God, and he said, "Go, sell the oil and pay your debts, and you and your sons can live on the rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>One day Eli'sha went on to Shunem, where a wealthy woman lived, who urged him to eat some food. So whenever he passed that way, he would turn in there to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband, "Behold now, I perceive that this is a holy man of God, who is continually passing our way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us make a small roof chamber with walls, and put there for him a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp, so that whenever he comes to us, he can go in there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>One day he came there, and he turned into the chamber and rested there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Geha'zi his servant, "Call this Shu'nammite." When he had called her, she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to him, "Say now to her, See, you have taken all this trouble for us; what is to be done for you? Would you have a word spoken on your behalf to the king or to the commander of the army?" She answered, "I dwell among my own people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, "What then is to be done for her?" Geha'zi answered, "Well, she has no son, and her husband is old."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>He said, "Call her." And when he had called her, she stood in the doorway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, "At this season, when the time comes round, you shall embrace a son." And she said, "No, my lord, O man of God; do not lie to your maidservant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>But the woman conceived, and she bore a son about that time the following spring, as Eli'sha had said to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>When the child had grown, he went out one day to his father among the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said to his father, "Oh, my head, my head!" The father said to his servant, "Carry him to his mother."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And when he had lifted him, and brought him to his mother, the child sat on her lap till noon, and then he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>Then she called to her husband, and said, "Send me one of the servants and one of the asses, that I may quickly go to the man of God, and come back again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, "Why will you go to him today? It is neither new moon nor sabbath." She said, "It will be well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled the ass, and she said to her servant, "Urge the beast on; do not slacken the pace for me unless I tell you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she set out, and came to the man of God at Mount Carmel.  When the man of God saw her coming, he said to Geha'zi his servant, "Look, yonder is the Shu'nammite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>run at once to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with you? Is it well with your husband? Is it well with the child?" And she answered, "It is well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And when she came to the mountain to the man of God, she caught hold of his feet. And Geha'zi came to thrust her away. But the man of God said, "Let her alone, for she is in bitter distress; and the LORD has hidden it from me, and has not told me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>Then she said, "Did I ask my lord for a son? Did I not say, Do not deceive me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>He said to Geha'zi, "Gird up your loins, and take my staff in your hand, and go. If you meet any one, do not salute him; and if any one salutes you, do not reply; and lay my staff upon the face of the child."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>Then the mother of the child said, "As the LORD lives, and as you yourself live, I will not leave you." So he arose and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>Geha'zi went on ahead and laid the staff upon the face of the child, but there was no sound or sign of life. Therefore he returned to meet him, and told him, "The child has not awaked."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>When Eli'sha came into the house, he saw the child lying dead on his bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>So he went in and shut the door upon the two of them, and prayed to the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>Then he went up and lay upon the child, putting his mouth upon his mouth, his eyes upon his eyes, and his hands upon his hands; and as he stretched himself upon him, the flesh of the child became warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Then he got up again, and walked once to and fro in the house, and went up, and stretched himself upon him; the child sneezed seven times, and the child opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>Then he summoned Geha'zi and said, "Call this Shu'nammite." So he called her. And when she came to him, he said, "Take up your son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.37'>She came and fell at his feet, bowing to the ground; then she took up her son and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.38'>And Eli'sha came again to Gilgal when there was a famine in the land. And as the sons of the prophets were sitting before him, he said to his servant, "Set on the great pot, and boil pottage for the sons of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.39'>One of them went out into the field to gather herbs, and found a wild vine and gathered from it his lap full of wild gourds, and came and cut them up into the pot of pottage, not knowing what they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.40'>And they poured out for the men to eat. But while they were eating of the pottage, they cried out, "O man of God, there is death in the pot!" And they could not eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.41'>He said, "Then bring meal." And he threw it into the pot, and said, "Pour out for the men, that they may eat." And there was no harm in the pot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.42'>A man came from Ba'al-shal'ishah, bringing the man of God bread of the first fruits, twenty loaves of barley, and fresh ears of grain in his sack. And Eli'sha said, "Give to the men, that they may eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.43'>But his servant said, "How am I to set this before a hundred men?" So he repeated, "Give them to the men, that they may eat, for thus says the LORD, `They shall eat and have some left.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.44'>So he set it before them. And they ate, and had some left, according to the word of the LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.1'>Na'aman, commander of the army of the king of Syria, was a great man with his master and in high favor, because by him the LORD had given victory to Syria. He was a mighty man of valor, but he was a leper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.2'>Now the Syrians on one of their raids had carried off a little maid from the land of Israel, and she waited on Na'aman's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.3'>She said to her mistress, "Would that my lord were with the prophet who is in Sama'ria! He would cure him of his leprosy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.4'>So Na'aman went in and told his lord, "Thus and so spoke the maiden from the land of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.5'>And the king of Syria said, "Go now, and I will send a letter to the king of Israel."  So he went, taking with him ten talents of silver, six thousand shekels of gold, and ten festal garments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.6'>And he brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read, "When this letter reaches you, know that I have sent to you Na'aman my servant, that you may cure him of his leprosy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.7'>And when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and said, "Am I God, to kill and to make alive, that this man sends word to me to cure a man of his leprosy? Only consider, and see how he is seeking a quarrel with me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.8'>But when Eli'sha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes, he sent to the king, saying, "Why have you rent your clothes? Let him come now to me, that he may know that there is a prophet in Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.9'>So Na'aman came with his horses and chariots, and halted at the door of Eli'sha's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.10'>And Eli'sha sent a messenger to him, saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and your flesh shall be restored, and you shall be clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.11'>But Na'aman was angry, and went away, saying, "Behold, I thought that he would surely come out to me, and stand, and call on the name of the LORD his God, and wave his hand over the place, and cure the leper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.12'>Are not Aba'na and Pharpar, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel? Could I not wash in them, and be clean?" So he turned and went away in a rage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.13'>But his servants came near and said to him, "My father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it? How much rather, then, when he says to you, `Wash, and be clean'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.14'>So he went down and dipped himself seven times in the Jordan, according to the word of the man of God; and his flesh was restored like the flesh of a little child, and he was clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.15'>Then he returned to the man of God, he and all his company, and he came and stood before him; and he said, "Behold, I know that there is no God in all the earth but in Israel; so accept now a present from your servant."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.16'>But he said, "As the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will receive none." And he urged him to take it, but he refused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.17'>Then Na'aman said, "If not, I pray you, let there be given to your servant two mules' burden of earth; for henceforth your servant will not offer burnt offering or sacrifice to any god but the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.18'>In this matter may the LORD pardon your servant: when my master goes into the house of Rimmon to worship there, leaning on my arm, and I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, when I bow myself in the house of Rimmon, the LORD pardon your servant in this matter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.19'>He said to him, "Go in peace."  But when Na'aman had gone from him a short distance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.20'>Geha'zi, the servant of Eli'sha the man of God, said, "See, my master has spared this Na'aman the Syrian, in not accepting from his hand what he brought. As the LORD lives, I will run after him, and get something from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.21'>So Geha'zi followed Na'aman. And when Na'aman saw some one running after him, he alighted from the chariot to meet him, and said, "Is all well?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.22'>And he said, "All is well. My master has sent me to say, `There have just now come to me from the hill country of E'phraim two young men of the sons of the prophets; pray, give them a talent of silver and two festal garments.'"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.23'>And Na'aman said, "Be pleased to accept two talents." And he urged him, and tied up two talents of silver in two bags, with two festal garments, and laid them upon two of his servants; and they carried them before Geha'zi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.24'>And when he came to the hill, he took them from their hand, and put them in the house; and he sent the men away, and they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.25'>He went in, and stood before his master, and Eli'sha said to him, "Where have you been, Geha'zi?" And he said, "Your servant went nowhere."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.26'>But he said to him, "Did I not go with you in spirit when the man turned from his chariot to meet you? Was it a time to accept money and garments, olive orchards and vineyards, sheep and oxen, menservants and maidservants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.27'>Therefore the leprosy of Na'aman shall cleave to you, and to your descendants for ever." So he went out from his presence a leper, as white as snow.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.1'>Now the sons of the prophets said to Eli'sha, "See, the place where we dwell under your charge is too small for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.2'>Let us go to the Jordan and each of us get there a log, and let us make a place for us to dwell there." And he answered, "Go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.3'>Then one of them said, "Be pleased to go with your servants." And he answered, "I will go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.4'>So he went with them. And when they came to the Jordan, they cut down trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.5'>But as one was felling a log, his axe head fell into the water; and he cried out, "Alas, my master! It was borrowed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.6'>Then the man of God said, "Where did it fall?" When he showed him the place, he cut off a stick, and threw it in there, and made the iron float.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.7'>And he said, "Take it up." So he reached out his hand and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.8'>Once when the king of Syria was warring against Israel, he took counsel with his servants, saying, "At such and such a place shall be my camp."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.9'>But the man of God sent word to the king of Israel, "Beware that you do not pass this place, for the Syrians are going down there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.10'>And the king of Israel sent to the place of which the man of God told him. Thus he used to warn him, so that he saved himself there more than once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.11'>And the mind of the king of Syria was greatly troubled because of this thing; and he called his servants and said to them, "Will you not show me who of us is for the king of Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.12'>And one of his servants said, "None, my lord, O king; but Eli'sha, the prophet who is in Israel, tells the king of Israel the words that you speak in your bedchamber."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.13'>And he said, "Go and see where he is, that I may send and seize him." It was told him, "Behold, he is in Dothan."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.14'>So he sent there horses and chariots and a great army; and they came by night, and surrounded the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.15'>When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold, an army with horses and chariots was round about the city. And the servant said, "Alas, my master! What shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.16'>He said, "Fear not, for those who are with us are more than those who are with them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.17'>Then Eli'sha prayed, and said, "O LORD, I pray thee, open his eyes that he may see." So the LORD opened the eyes of the young man, and he saw; and behold, the mountain was full of horses and chariots of fire round about Eli'sha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.18'>And when the Syrians came down against him, Eli'sha prayed to the LORD, and said, "Strike this people, I pray thee, with blindness." So he struck them with blindness in accordance with the prayer of Eli'sha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.19'>And Eli'sha said to them, "This is not the way, and this is not the city; follow me, and I will bring you to the man whom you seek." And he led them to Sama'ria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.20'>As soon as they entered Sama'ria, Eli'sha said, "O LORD, open the eyes of these men, that they may see." So the LORD opened their eyes, and they saw; and lo, they were in the midst of Sama'ria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.21'>When the king of Israel saw them he said to Eli'sha, "My father, shall I slay them? Shall I slay them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.22'>He answered, "You shall not slay them. Would you slay those whom you have taken captive with your sword and with your bow? Set bread and water before them, that they may eat and drink and go to their master."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.23'>So he prepared for them a great feast; and when they had eaten and drunk, he sent them away, and they went to their master. And the Syrians came no more on raids into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.24'>Afterward Ben-ha'dad king of Syria mustered his entire army, and went up, and besieged Sama'ria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.25'>And there was a great famine in Sama'ria, as they besieged it, until an ass's head was sold for eighty shekels of silver, and the fourth part of a kab of dove's dung for five shekels of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.26'>Now as the king of Israel was passing by upon the wall, a woman cried out to him, saying, "Help, my lord, O king!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.27'>And he said, "If the LORD will not help you, whence shall I help you? From the threshing floor, or from the wine press?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.28'>And the king asked her, "What is your trouble?" She answered, "This woman said to me, `Give your son, that we may eat him today, and we will eat my son tomorrow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.29'>So we boiled my son, and ate him. And on the next day I said to her, `Give your son, that we may eat him'; but she has hidden her son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.30'>When the king heard the words of the woman he rent his clothes--now he was passing by upon the wall--and the people looked, and behold, he had sackcloth beneath upon his body--</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.31'>and he said, "May God do so to me, and more also, if the head of Eli'sha the son of Shaphat remains on his shoulders today."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.32'>Eli'sha was sitting in his house, and the elders were sitting with him. Now the king had dispatched a man from his presence; but before the messenger arrived Eli'sha said to the elders, "Do you see how this murderer has sent to take off my head? Look, when the messenger comes, shut the door, and hold the door fast against him. Is not the sound of his master's feet behind him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.33'>And while he was still speaking with them, the king came down to him and said, "This trouble is from the LORD! Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.1'>But Eli'sha said, "Hear the word of the LORD: thus says the LORD, Tomorrow about this time a measure of fine meal shall be sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, at the gate of Sama'ria."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.2'>Then the captain on whose hand the king leaned said to the man of God, "If the LORD himself should make windows in heaven, could this thing be?" But he said, "You shall see it with your own eyes, but you shall not eat of it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.3'>Now there were four men who were lepers at the entrance to the gate; and they said to one another, "Why do we sit here till we die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.4'>If we say, `Let us enter the city,' the famine is in the city, and we shall die there; and if we sit here, we die also. So now come, let us go over to the camp of the Syrians; if they spare our lives we shall live, and if they kill us we shall but die."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.5'>So they arose at twilight to go to the camp of the Syrians; but when they came to the edge of the camp of the Syrians, behold, there was no one there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.6'>For the Lord had made the army of the Syrians hear the sound of chariots, and of horses, the sound of a great army, so that they said to one another, "Behold, the king of Israel has hired against us the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Egypt to come upon us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.7'>So they fled away in the twilight and forsook their tents, their horses, and their asses, leaving the camp as it was, and fled for their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.8'>And when these lepers came to the edge of the camp, they went into a tent, and ate and drank, and they carried off silver and gold and clothing, and went and hid them; then they came back, and entered another tent, and carried off things from it, and went and hid them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.9'>Then they said to one another, "We are not doing right. This day is a day of good news; if we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us; now therefore come, let us go and tell the king's household."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.10'>So they came and called to the gatekeepers of the city, and told them, "We came to the camp of the Syrians, and behold, there was no one to be seen or heard there, nothing but the horses tied, and the asses tied, and the tents as they were."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.11'>Then the gatekeepers called out, and it was told within the king's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.12'>And the king rose in the night, and said to his servants, "I will tell you what the Syrians have prepared against us.

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.13'>And one of his servants said, "Let some men take five of the remaining horses, seeing that those who are left here will fare like the whole multitude of Israel that have already perished; let us send and see."</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.15'>So they went after them as far as the Jordan; and, lo, all the way was littered with garments and equipment which the Syrians had thrown away in their haste. And the messengers returned, and told the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.16'>Then the people went out, and plundered the camp of the Syrians. So a measure of fine meal was sold for a shekel, and two measures of barley for a shekel, according to the word of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.17'>Now the king had appointed the captain on whose hand he leaned to have charge of the gate; and the people trod upon him in the gate, so that he died, as the man of God had said when the king came down to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.13'>And Haz'ael said, "What is your servant, who is but a dog, that he should do this great thing?" Eli'sha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you are to be king over Syria."</verse>
