      <chapter osisID='2Chr.1'>
        <title>And there are the courses of the priests and the Levites, for all the service of the house of God,and, with thee, in all manner of work, is every willing, skilful man for any service, also the rulers and all the people, for all thine affairs.</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>And Solomon, son of David, strengthened himself over his kingdom,and, Yahweh, his God, was with him, and made him surpassingly great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>And Solomon gave word to all Israelto the rulers of thousands, and hundreds, and to the judges, and to all the leaders of all Israel, ancestral chiefs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>and Solomon, and all the convocation with him, went to the high place that was in Gibeon,for, there, was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh made in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>Howbeit, the ark of God, had David brought up from Kiriath-jearim, into the place that David had prepared for it,for he had pitched for it a tent, in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>Also, the altar of bronze that Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur had made, was there before the habitation of Yahweh,so Solomon and the convocation sought it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>And Solomon went up thither, unto the altar of bronze before Yahweh, which belonged to the tent of meeting,and caused to go up thereon a thousand ascending-sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>During that night, God appeared unto Solomon,and said unto him, Ask what I shall give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>And Solomon said unto God, Thou thyself, didst deal with David my father in great lovingkindness,and hast made me king in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>Now, O Yahweh Elohim, let thy word with David my father be brought to pass,-for, thou, hast made me king over a people, for multitude like the dust of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>Now, wisdom and knowledge, give thou unto me, that I may go out before this people, and may come in,for who can judge this thy people, that is so great?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>And God said unto Solomon, Because this was near thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, or the life of them that hate thee, nor even, many days, hast thou asked,but hast asked for thyself, wisdom and knowledge, that thou mayest judge my people, over whom I have made thee king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>wisdom and knowledge, are granted unto thee,moreover, riches and wealth and honour, will I give thee, such as the kings who were before thee did not possess, neither shall they who come after thee possess the like.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>And Solomon came from the high place that was in Gibeon unto Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting,and reigned over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen, and came to have a thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen,and he settled them in chariot cities, and with the king, in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem, like stones, and, cedars, made he like the sycomores that are in the lowland, for abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>And the horses which Solomon had were, an export, out of Egypt,and a, company of royal merchants, used to fetch a drove, at a price;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>and they built and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot, for six hundred</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>Then Solomon gave word to build a house for the Name of Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>And Solomon numbered seventy thousand men to bear burdens, and eighty thousand men to hew in the mountain,and, to oversee them, three thousand six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>And Solomon sent unto Huram king of Tyre, saying,As thou didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to build him a house to dwell in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>lo! I, am about to build a house for the Name of Yahweh my God, to hallow unto himto burn before him sweet incense, and for a continual setting in array, and to offer ascending-sacrifices morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons, and on the appointed feasts of Yahweh our God,-age-abiding, is this   for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>And, the house which I am about to build,   great,for great is our God, above all gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>But who is able to build unto him a house? for, the heavens, even the heaven of heavens, cannot contain him,who then am, I, that I should build unto him a house, though only to burn incense before him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>Now, therefore, send me a wise man, to work in gold and in silver and in bronze and in iron, and in purple and crimson and blue, and skilful to execute gravings,with the wise men who are with me, in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom my father David did provide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>And send metimbers of cedar, cypress and sandal-wood, out of the Lebanon, for, I, know that, thy servants, are skilful, to cut the timbers of Lebanon,and lo! my servants shall be with thy servants:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>yea to prepare me timbers in abundance,for, the house which I am about to build,   great and most wonderful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>And lo! for the hewers that cut the timbers, have I given wheat as food for thy servants, twenty thousand measures, and barley, twenty thousand measures, and wine, twenty thousand baths, and oil, twenty thousand baths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>Then answered Huram king of Tyre, in writing, which he sent unto Solomon,Because Yahweh hath loved his people, hath he set thee over them as king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>And Huram said, Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth,who hath given, unto David the king, a wise son, skilled in prudence and understanding, who will build a house for Yahweh, and a house for his kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>Now, therefore, have I sent a wise man, skilled in understanding, pertaining to Huram my father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, whose father was a man of Tyre, skilled to work in gold and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stones and in timber, in purple, in blue and in fine white linen, and in crimson, and to grave any manner of graving, and to devise any manner of device that may be given to him, with thy wise men, and the wise men of my lord David thy father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>Now, therefore, the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, whereof my lord hath spoken, let him send unto his servants;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>and, we, will cut down timbers out of the Lebanon, according to all thy need, and will bring them unto thee in floats, upon the sea to Joppa,and, thou, shalt fetch them up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>So Solomon numbered all the men that were sojourners, who were in the land of Israel, after the numbering, wherewith David his father had numbered them,and they were found to bea hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>And he made up from among themseventy thousand, to bear burdens, and eighty thousand to hew in the mountain,and three thousand and six hundred, as overseers, to keep the people at work.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Then began Solomon, to build the house of Yahweh, in Jerusalem, in Mount Moriah, where he had appeared unto David his father,-in the place which David had prepared, in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>And he began to build, in the second month, on the second, in the fourth year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>And, these, are the things wherein Solomon was grounded for the building of the house of God,The length, by cubits, in the first measure, was sixty cubits, and, the breadth, twenty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>And, the porch which was in front of the length, in front of the breadth of the house, was twenty cubits, and, the height thereof, was a hundred and twenty,and he overlaid it, within, with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>And, the greater house, covered he with cypress wood, and overlaid it with fine gold,and raised thereon palms, and wreathed garlands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>And he covered the house with precious stones, for beauty,and, the gold, was gold of Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>And he covered the house, the beams, the entrance-hall, and the walls thereof and the doors thereof, with gold,and he carved cherubim upon the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>And he made the most holy house, the length whereof, was, according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and, the breadth thereof, twenty cubits,and he covered it with fine gold, to   six hundred talents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>and, the weight of the nails, amounted to fifty shekels of gold,and, the upper chambers, covered he with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>And he made, in the most holy house, two cherubim, of carved work,and covered them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>And, as for the wings of the cherubim, the length of them, was twenty cubits,the one wing, by the cubit was five, reaching to the wall of the house, and, the other wing, five cubits, reaching to the wing of the other cherub;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>and, the wing of the other cherub, was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house,and, the other wing, was five cubits, cleaving to the wing of the other cherub:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>the wings of these cherubim, outspread, were twenty cubits,and, they themselves, were standing upon their feet, and, their faces, were inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>And he made a vail, of blue and purple, and crimson and byssus cloth,and raised thereon cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>And he made, for the front of the house, two pillars, thirty five cubits in length,and, the capital which was upon the top of each, was five cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>And he made wreathen chains in the shrine, and put them upon the top of the pillars,and he made one hundred pomegranates, and put them in the chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>And he reared up the pillars in front of the temple, one, on the right, and, one, on the left,and called the name of that on the right hand, Jachin, and the name of that on the left, Boaz.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>And he made an altar of bronze, twenty cubits, the length thereof, and, twenty cubits, the breadth thereof,and, ten cubits, the height thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>And he made a molten sea,tenby the cubit, from the one brim thereof into the other brim thereof, it was round all about, and, fiveby the cubit, was the height thereof, and, a lineof thirty by the cubit, did compass it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>And, the likeness of oxen, was under it round about on every side, encircling it, ten in a cubit, going round the sea, on every side,-two rows of oxen, made in the casting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>It was standing on twelve oxen, three, looking toward the north, and, three, looking toward the west, and, three, looking toward the south, and, three, looking toward the east, the sea, being upon them above,and, all their hinder parts, inward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>And, the thickness thereof, was a hand-breadth, and, the brim thereof, was like the brim-work of a cup, with blossoms of lilies,it could hold   baths, three thousand, would it contain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>And he made ten lavers, and set five on the right handand five on the left, to bathe therein, what is offered as an ascending-sacrifice, do they rinse therein,but, the sea, was, that the priests should bathe therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>And he made ten lampstands of gold according to the regulation thereof,and set in the temple, five, on the right hand, and, five, on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>And he made ten tables, and placed in the temple, five, on the right hand, and, five, on the left,and he made a hundred tossing bowls of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>And he made the court of the priests, and the large enclosure,and doors to the enclosure, and, the doors thereof, overlaid he with bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>And, the sea, he set on the right side of the house, eastward over against the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>And Huram madethe pans, and the shovels, and the tossing bowls,and Huram finished doing the work, which he did for King Solomon, in the house of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>two pillars, and the bowls and the capitals on the top of the two pillars, and the two frames of checker work, to cover the two bowls of the capitals, which were on the top of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>and four hundred pomegranates, for the two frames,-two rows of pomegranates, for each frame, for covering the two bowls of the capitals, which were on the face of the pillars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>and, the stands, made he,and, the lavers, made he upon the stands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>the one sea,and the twelve oxen under it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>and, the pans and the shovels and the flesh-hooks, and all the vessels, made Huram his father for King Solomon, for the house of Yahweh,of burnished bronze,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>In the circuit of the Jordan, did the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>So Solomon made all these utensils, in great abundance,for the weight of the bronze could not be searched out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>Yea Solomon made all the utensils which were for the house of God,and the altar of gold, and the rubles, whereon was the Presence-bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>and the lamp-holders and their lamps, that they should burn according to the regulation before the shrine, of purified gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>and the blossom-work, and the lamps, and the tongs, of gold,the same, was the purest gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>and the snuffers and the bowls and the spoons and the censers, of purified gold,and the entrance of the house, the inner doors thereof for the holy of holies, and the doors of the house of the temple, were of gold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>Thus was perfected, all the work, which Solomon made, for the house of Yahweh,and Solomon brought in the hallowed things of David his father, the silver, and the gold, and all the utensils, placed he, in the treasuries of the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>Then, Solomon called together the elders of Israel, and all the chiefs of the tribes, the ancestral leaders of the sons of Israel, unto Jerusalem,to bring up the ark of the covenant of Yahweh out of the city of David, the same, is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>And all the men of Israel came together unto the king, in the festival,the same, was the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>And all the elders of Israel came in,and the Levites bare the ark;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>and they brought up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all the holy utensils, that were in the tent,the priests the Levites did bring them up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>And, King Solomon, and all the assembly of Israel who assembled themselves unto him, before the ark, were sacrificing sheep and oxen, which could not be told nor could they be counted, for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of Yahweh into the place thereof, into the shrine of the house, into the holy of holies,into   beneath the wings of the cherubim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>for the cherubim were spreading forth two wings, over the place of the ark,so that the cherubim formed a covering over the ark and over the staves thereof, from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>And they drew out the staves, and the heads of the staves could be seen out of the ark, in front of the shrine, although they could not be seen on the outside,and it came to pass that they have remained thereunto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>There was, nothing in the ark, save only the two tables, which Moses placed</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>And it came to pass, when the priests, came forth, out of the holy place,for, all the priests who were present, had hallowed themselves, they had no need to observe the courses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>and, the Levites who were the singers, even all of them pertaining to Asaph, to Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons and to their brethren, arrayed in white linen, with cymbals and with harps and lyres, stood eastward of the altar,and, with them, priests to the number of a hundred-and-twenty, blowing with trumpets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>then came it to pass, when the trumpeters and the singers were, as one, to make one sound to be heard in offering praise and giving thanks unto Yahwehyea when they did lift on high the voice, with the trumpets and with the cymbals and with the instruments of song, yea in offering praise unto YahwehFor he is good, For, age-abiding, is his lovingkindness, that, the house, was filled with the cloud of the glory of Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>and the priests could not stand to minister, by reason of the cloud,-for, the glory of Yahweh, filled, the house of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then, said Solomon,Yahweh, said, that he would make his habitation in thick gloom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>But, I, have built a house as a home for thee,A settled place for thee to abide in, for ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>And the king turned about his face, and blessed all the convocation of Israel,while, all the convocation of Israel, was standing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>and he said, Blessed be Yahweh, God of Israel, who spake with his mouth, unto David my father,-and, with his hand, hath fulfilled, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>From the day I brought forth my people out of the land of Egypt, I made choice of no city, out of all the tribes of Israel, for building a house, where my Name might be,neither made I choice of any man, to be chief ruler over my people Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>nevertheless I have made choice of Jerusalem, that my Name might be there,and I have made choice of David, that he might be over my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>And so it came to pass, that it was near the heart of David my father,to build a house, to the Name of Yahweh, God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>Then said Yahweh unto David my father, Because it was near thy heart to build a house for my Name, thou didst well that it was near thy heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>Only, thou thyself, must not build the house,but, thine own son, that proceedeth out of thy loinshe, shall build the house for my Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>So then Yahweh hath established his word, which he spake,and I have been raised up instead of David my father, and have taken my seat upon the throne of Israel, as spake Yahweh, and have built the house to the Name of Yahweh, God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>and have put there, the ark,wherein is the covenant of Yahweh,which he solemnised with the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>Then stood he before the altar of Yahweh, in the presence of all the convocation of Israel,and spread forth his hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>for Solomon had made a platform of bronze, and had set it in the midst of the enclosure, five cubits, the length thereof, and, five cubits, the breadth thereof, and, three cubits, the height thereof,-and he stood thereon, and knelt upon his knees, in the presence of all the convocation of Israel, and spread forth his hands, heavenward;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>and said, O Yahweh! God of Israel, Not like unto thee, is there a god, in the heavens, or throughout the earth,who keepest Covenant and Lovingkindness for thy servants who are walking before thee with all their heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>who hast kept, for thy servant David my father, that which thou didst promise him,in that thou didst promise with thy mouth, and, with thy hand, hast fulfilled, as   this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>Now, therefore, O YahwehGod of Israel, keep thou, for thy servant David my father, that which thou didst promise him, saying, There shall not be cut off to thee a man, from before me, to sit upon the throne of Israel, if only, thy sons take heed to their way, to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>Now, therefore, O Yahweh, God of Israel,-verified be thy promise, which thou didst make unto thy servant David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>But, in very deed, will God dwell with man on the earth? Lo! the heavens, even the leaven of heavens, cannot contain thee, how much less this house which I have built!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.1'>And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of Yahweh,and all Israel with him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>And it came to pass that, Asa, had a force bearing shield and spear, out of Judah, three hundred thousand, and, out of Benjamin, such as bare a buckler and trode a bow, two hundred and eighty thousand,all these, were heroes of valour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.9'>Then came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian, with a force of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots,and he came as far as Mareshah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.10'>And Asa went out to meet him,and they set in array for battle, in the valley of Zaphonah, at Mareshah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.16'>yet became they mockers of the messengers of God, and despisers of his words, and mimics of his prophets,until the mounting up of the wrath of Yahweh against his people, until there was no healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.17'>So he brought up against them the king of the Chaldeans, who slew their young men with the sword, in the house of their sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or virgin, elder or ancient,-all, delivered he into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.18'>And, all the utensils of the house of God, both great and small, and the treasures of the house of Yahweh, and the treasures of the king and of his rulers, the whole, carried he to Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.19'>and they burned the house of God, and threw down the wall of Jerusalem,and, all the palaces thereof, burned they with fire, and, all the precious vessels thereof, he destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.20'>and he exiled the remnant left from the sword, into Babylon,where they became his and his sons, as servants, until the reign of the kingdom of Persia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.21'>to fulfil the word of God, by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had paid off her sabbaths,all the days of her lying desolate, she kept sabbath, to fulfil seventy years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.22'>But, in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, to accomplish the word of God by the mouth of Jeremiah, Yahweh aroused the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made proclamation throughout all his kingdom, moreover also in writing, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.23'>Thus, saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth, hath Yahweh God of the heavens, given unto me, and, he himself, hath laid charge upon me, to build to him a house, in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is there among you of all his people with whom is Yahweh his God? Then let him go up.</verse>
