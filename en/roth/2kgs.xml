        <title>Hast thou seen that Allah hath humbled himself, before me? Because he hath humbled himself before me, I will not bring in the calamity in his days, In the days of his son, will I bring in the calamity upon his house.</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Then Moab revolted against Israel, after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ahaziah fell through the lattice in his upper chamber, which was in Samaria, and became sick,so he sent messengers, and said unto themGo enquire of Baalzebub, god of Ekron, whether I shall recover from this sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But, the messenger of Yahweh, spake unto Elijah the Tishbite, Rise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria,and say unto themIs it, because there is no God in Israel, that, ye, are going to enquire of Baalzebub, god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Wherefore, Thus, saith Yahweh, From the bed whereunto thou hast gone up, shalt thou not come down, for thou shalt, surely die. And Elijah departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And, when the messengers returned unto him, he said unto themHow is it that ye have returned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said unto himA man, came up to meet us, and said unto usGo, return unto the king who sent you, and ye shall say unto him, Thus, saith YahwehIs it, because there is no God in Israel, that, thou, art sending to enquire of Baalzebub, god of Ekron? Therefore, from the bed whereunto thou hast gone up, shalt thou not come down, for thou shalt, surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said unto them, What was the manner of the man who came up to meet you,and spake unto you these words?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they said unto himA hairy man, with a leathern girdle girt about his loins. And he saidElijah the Tishbite, it was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then sent he unto him a captain of fifty, with his fifty, and he went up unto him, and lo! he abode on the top of the mountain, and he said unto him, O man of God! the king, hath said, Come down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah responded and said unto the captain of fifty, If, then, a man of God, I am, let fire come down out of the heavens, and devour thee and thy fifty. So there came down fire out of the heavens, and devoured him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Then he again sent unto him another captain of fifty, with his fifty. And he also spake and said unto him, O man of God! thus, saith the king, Haste thee, come down!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah responded and said unto themIf, a man of God, I am, let fire come down out of the heavens, and devour thee and thy fifty. And there came down a fire of God, out of the heavens, and devoured him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>Then he again sent a third captain of fifty, with his fifty,and the third captain of fifty ascended and came near, and bowed down upon his knees before Elijah, and made supplication unto him, and said unto him, O man of God! let my life, I pray thee, and the lives of these thy fifty servants, be precious in thine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Lo! there hath come down fire out of the heavens, and devoured the captains of the former fifties, with their fifties,now, therefore, let my life be precious in thine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the messenger of Yahweh said unto Elijah, Go down with him, do not fear because of him, So he arose, and went down with him, unto the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>and said unto himThus, saith YahwehFor that thou didst send messengers to enquire of Baalzebub, god of Ekron, was it because there was no God in Israel, for whose word thou couldst enquire? Therefore, from the bed whereunto thou hast gone up, shalt thou not come down, for thou shalt, surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>And he died, according to the word of Yahweh which, Elijah, had spoken, and Jehoram reigned in his stead, in the second year of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now, the rest of the story of Ahaziah, the things that he did, are, they, not written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when Yahweh was about to take up Elijah in a storm into the heavens, that Elijah departed, with Elisha, from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>Then said Elijah unto ElishaTarry here, I pray thee, for, Yahweh, hath sent me as far as Bethel. And Elisha said, By the life of Yahweh and by the life of thine own soul, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets who were in Bethel came forth unto Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that, to-day, Yahweh is taking away thy lord, from thy head? And he saidI also, know, be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>Then Elijah said to himElisha, I pray thee, tarry here, for, Yahweh, hath sent me to Jericho. And he saidBy the life of Yahweh and by the life of thine own soul, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>Then drew near the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho, unto Elisha, and said unto him, Knowest thou that, to-day, Yahweh is taking away thy lord from thy head? And he saidI also, know; be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said to himTarry here, I pray thee, for, Yahweh, hath sent me to the Jordan. And he saidBy the life of Yahweh and by the life of thine own soul, I will not leave thee. So they two, went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>But, fifty men of the sons of the prophets, came, and stood over against them, afar off,and, they two, stood by the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>Then Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided, hither and thither,so that they two, passed over, on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass, as they went over, that, Elijah, said unto ElishaAsk, what I shall do for thee, ere yet I be taken from thee. And Elisha said, Let there be, I pray thee, a double portion of thy spirit upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he saidThou hast asked a hard thing,if thou see me when taken from thee, thou shall have it, so, but, if not, thou shalt not have it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass, as they were going on and on and talking, that lo! there was a chariot of fire, with horses of fire, which parted, those two, asunder,and Elijah went up in a storm, into the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And, as soon as Elisha saw it, he, began crying outMy father! my father! The chariots of Israel, and the horsemen thereof! But, when he could see him no longer, he took hold of his clothes, and rent them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>Then took he up the mantle of Elijah, which had fallen from him,and returned and stood, on the brink of the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>and took the mantle of Elijah which had fallen from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is Yahweh, the God of Elijah? And, when, he also, smote the waters, they were divided, hither and thither, and Elisha, passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And, when the sons of the prophets who were in Jericho, over against him, saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah, resteth, on Elisha. So they came to meet him, and bowed themselves down to him, to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>Then said they unto himLo! we pray thee, there are with thy servants fifty men, sons of valourlet them go, we pray thee, and seek thy lord, lest the Spirit of Yahweh have borne him away, and cast him on one of the mountains, or into one of the valleys. And he saidYe shall not send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>But, when they urged him until he was ashamed, he saidSend. So they sent fifty men, and made search three days, but found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And, when they came back unto him, he, having tarried at Jericho, he said unto them, Did I not say unto you, Do not go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said unto Elisha, Lo! we pray thee, the situation of the city, is good, as, my lord, seeth,but, the waters, are bad, and, the land, apt to miscarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he saidBring me a new bowl, and put therein, salt. So they brought it unto him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>and he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast therein, saith,and saidThus, saith Yahweh, I have healed these waters; there shall come from thence, no longer, death or aptness to miscarry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed,   unto this day,according to the word of Elisha which he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from thence, to Bethel,and, as he was going up on the way, some lads, came forth, out of the city, and made mockery of him, and said to him, Go up, bald head! Go up, bald head!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And, when he turned round and saw them, he cursed them, in the name of Yahweh,and there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tare, of them, forty-two youths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from thence, unto Mount Carmel,and, from thence, he returned, to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now, Jehoram son of Ahab, began to reign over Israel, in Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah,and he reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he did the thing that was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh, only, not like his father, nor like his mother,but he put away the pillars of Baal which, his father, had made;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>nevertheless, unto the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat which he caused Israel to commit, he did cleave,he turned not away therefrom</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>Now, Mesha king of Moab, was a sheep-master,and used to render to the king of Israel, the wool of hundred thousand fat sheep, and of a hundred thousand rams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>And it came to pass, when Ahab died, that the king of Moab revolted against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>So King Jehoram went forth, on that day, out of Samaria, and numbered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he departed, and sent unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah, sayingThe king of Moab, hath revolted against me, wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he saidI will go up, I am as thou art, my people are as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he saidWhich way, then, shall we go up? And he saidThe way of the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>Then departed the king of Israel, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom, and went round, a journey of seven days,and there was no water for the host, nor for the cattle that went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>Then said the king of IsraelAlas! for Yahweh hath called these three kings, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>So Jehoshaphat saidIs there not, here, a prophet of Yahweh, that we may enquire of Yahweh, from him? Then answered one of the servants of the king of Israel, and said, Here, is Elisha son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>Then said Jehoshaphat, The word of Yahweh, is with him. So the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom, went down unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said unto the king of IsraelWhat have I and thou in common? get thee unto the prophets of thy father, and unto the prophets of thy mother. But the king of Israel said to himNay! for Yahweh hath called together these three kings, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>Then said ElishaBy the life of Yahweh of hosts, before whom I stand, were it not that, the countenance of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, I would lift up, I would neither look at thee, nor see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But, now, bring me one that can touch the strings. For it used to be, when the player touched the strings, then would, the hand of Yahweh, be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>Then said he, Thus, saith Yahweh, Make, in this torrent-bed, pits, pits!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For, thus, saith YahwehYe shall not see wind, and ye shall not see rain, yet, that torrent-bed, shall be filled with water,And ye shall drink, ye, and your cattle, and your beasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And, this being a small thing in the eyes of Yahweh, he will deliver Moab into your hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And ye shall smite every strong city, and every choice city, and, every goodly tree, shall ye fell, and, all fountains water, shall ye close up,and, every goodly heritage, shall ye mar with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass, in the morning, when the offering ascended, that lo! waters, were coming in from the way of Edom,and the land was filled with the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>Now, all Moab, had heard that the kings had come up to fight against them,so they came together, from all who could gird on a girdle and upwards, and took their stand at the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And, when they rose early in the morning, the sun, shone forth upon the waters,and so the Moabites beheld over against them, the waters, red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>They said thereforeBlood,this! Destroyed! The kings have destroyed each other! Yea they have smitten every man his neighbour,Now, then, to the spoil, O Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And, when they came into the camp of Israel, Israel arose and smote Moab, and they fled from before them,so they entered thereinto, yea still farther entered Moab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And, the cities, they pulled down, and, on every goodly heritage, they cast every man his stone, and filled it, and, all fountains of waters, they closed up, and, every goodly tree, they felled, and, though they left the stones thereof in Kir-haraseth, yet the slingers surrounded and smote it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And, when the king of Moab saw that, the battle, prevailed against him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through against the king of Edom, but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>So he took his firstborn son who was to have reigned in his stead, and offered him up as an ascending-sacrifice upon the wall. And so it came to pass that there was great indignation against Israel. And they brake up from against him, and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now, a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets, made outcry unto Elisha, sayingThy servant, my husband, is dead, and, thou, knowest that, thy servant, was one who revered Yahweh,now, the creditor, hath come to take my two boys to himself as bondmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said unto herWhat shall I do for thee? tell me what thou, hast, in the house. And she saidThy maid-servant hath, nothing at all, in the house, save a flask of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>And he saidGo, ask thee vessels, from without, of all thy neighbours,empty vessels, let them not be few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And, when thou hast come in, then shalt thou shut the door behind thee and behind thy sons, and shalt pour out into all these vessels,and, that which is full, shalt thou set aside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went out from his presence, and shut the door behind her, and behind her sons,they bringing near to her, and she pouring out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said unto her sonBring me a vessel more. And he said unto herThere is not a vessel more. And the oil stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then came she in, and told the man of God, and he saidGo, sell the oil, and pay thy creditor,and, thou and thy sons, shall live of the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And so it was, on a day, that Elisha passed over unto Shunem, where was a woman of position, and she constrained him to eat bread,and so it came about, whensoever he passed that way, that he turned aside thither, to eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>Then said she unto her husband, Lo! I pray theeI perceive that, a holy man of God, he is,passing our way continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>I pray thee, let us make a little upper chamber on the wall and set for him therea bed, and a table, and a seat, and a lampstand,so shall it be, when he cometh to us, that he can turn in thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And it came to pass, on a day, that he came thither,so he turned aside into the upper chamber, and slept there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>Then said he unto Gehazi, his young man, Call this Shunammitess. And he called her, and she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to himI pray thee, say unto herLo! thou hast cared for us with all this anxious care, what can be done for thee? Is it, that we should speak for thee, unto the king, or unto the general of the army? But she said, In the midst of mine own people, do, I, dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>So he said, What then can be done for thee? And Gehazi said, Verily, she hath no, son, and, her husband, is, old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he saidCall her. So he called her, and she stood in the doorway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>Then said heAt this season, about the time of spring, thou, shalt be embracing a son. And she saidNay! my lord, thou man of God, do not delude thy maid-servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived, and bare a son, at this season, about the time of spring, when Elisha, had spoken unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And, when the child was grown, it came to pass, on a certain day, that he went out unto his father, unto the reapers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>and he said unto his fatherMy head! my head! So he said unto the young man, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And, when he had carried him, and brought him in unto his mother, he sat on her knees until noon, and then died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up and laid him on the bed of the man of God,and shut him in, and then went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called unto her husband, and saidSend me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the asses,that I may run unto the man of God, and return!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he saidWherefore art thou going unto him, to-day, neither new moon nor sabbath? And she saidPeace!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then saddled she the ass, and said unto her young manLead on, and go forward,do not slacken, for my sake, the riding, except I have bidden thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went her way, and came unto the man of God, unto Mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her, opposite, that he said unto Gehazi young man, Lo! this Shunammitess!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Now, run, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to herIs it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she said, Well!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>But, when she came unto the man of God, on the mount, she caught hold of his feet,and Gehazi drew near to thrust her away, when the man of God saidLet her alone! for, her life, is embittered to her, howbeit, Yahweh, hath hidden it from me, and hath not told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>Then said she, Did I ask a son, of my lord? Said I not, Thou must not mislead me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>And he said to GehaziGird thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way, if thou meet with any man, thou must not bless him, and, if any man bless thee, thou must not respond to him,then shalt thou lay my staff upon the face of the boy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>But the mother of the boy said, By the life of Yahweh and by the life of thine own soul, I will not leave thee. So he arose and followed her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>Now, Gehazi, had passed on before them, and laid the staff on the face of the boy, but there was neither voice, nor attention,so he returned to meet him, and told him, sayingThe boy hath not awaked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>And, when Elisha had come into the house, lo! the boy, was dead, laid upon his bed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.1'>In those days, was Hezekiah sick, unto death,and Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, came unto him, and said unto himThus, saith Yahweh Set in order thy house, for, about to die, thou, art, and shalt not recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.2'>Then he turned his face unto the wall,and prayed unto Yahweh, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.3'>I beseech thee, O Yahweh, remember, I pray thee, how I have walked before thee, in truth, and with a whole heart, and, that which is good in thine eyes, have I done! And Hezekiah wept aloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.4'>And it came to pass that Isaiah, had not gone out into the middle court, when the word of Yahweh came unto him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.5'>Return, and thou shalt say unto Hezekiah the leader of my peopleThus, saith Yahweh, God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears,Behold me! about to heal thee, On the third day, shalt thou go up unto the house of Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.6'>And I will add unto thy days, fifteen years, and, out of the hand of the king of Assyria, will I deliver thee, and this city,and will throw a covering over this city, for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.7'>And Isaiah saidTake ye a cake of figs. So they took and laid it upon the boil, and he recovered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.8'>Now Hezekiah had said unto Isaiah, What sign is there, that Yahweh will heal me,and that I shall go up on the third day, to the house of Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.9'>And Isaiah said,This unto thee, is the sign from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do the thing which he hath spoken, The shadow hath gone forward ten steps, shall it return ten steps?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.11'>And Isaiah the prophet cried unto Yahweh, and he caused the shadow on the steps by which it had gone down on the steps of Ahaz to go back, ten steps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.12'>At that time, Berodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a present, unto Hezekiah,for he had heard that Hezekiah had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.13'>And Hezekiah hearkened unto them, and shewed them all his house of precious thingsthe silver, and the gold, and the spices, and the precious ointment, and his armoury, and all that was found among his treasures,there was, nothing, that Hezekiah shewed them not, in his house or in all his dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.14'>Then came Isaiah the prophet unto King Hezekiah,and said unto himWhat said these men, and from whence came they unto thee? And Hezekiah said, From a land far off, came theyfrom Babylon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.16'>Then said Isaiah unto Hezekiah,Hear thou the word of Yahweh:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.19'>And Hezekiah said unto IsaiahGood, is the word of Yahweh, which thou hast spoken. And he saidIs it not, that, peace and stability, there shall be in my days?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.3'>He again built the high places, which Hezekiah his father had destroyed,and reared altars to Baal, and made a Sacred Stem, as did Ahab, king of Israel, and bowed down to all the army of the heavens, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.4'>And he used to build altars in the house of Yahweh,concerning which Yahweh had said,In Jerusalem, will I put my Name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.6'>and caused his son to pass through the fire, and practiced hidden arts and used divination, and dealt with a familiar spirit and wizards,he exceeded in doing the thing that was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh, provoking    to anger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.7'>and he set the image of the Sacred Stem which he had made,in the house, of which Yahweh had said unto David, and unto Solomon his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, will I put my Name, unto times age-abiding;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.16'>Moreover also, innocent blood, did Manasseh shed in great abundance, till he had filled Jerusalem, from one end to the other, besides his committing the sins which he caused, Judah, to commit, in doing the thing that was wicked in the eyes of Yahweh.</verse>
