      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <title>When ye transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God which he hath commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves down unto them, then will the anger of Yahweh kindle upon you, and ye will perish quickly, from off the good land which he hath given unto you.</title>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>And it came to pass, after the death of Jeshua, that the sons of Israel asked of Yahweh, saying,Who shall go up for us against the Canaanites, first, to make war upon them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And Yahweh saidJudah, shall go,lo! I have delivered the land into his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>Then said Judah, unto Simeon his brotherCome up with me into the territory allotted me, and let us make war on the Canaanites, then will, I also, go with thee, into thy territory. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up, and Yahweh delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand,and they smote them in Bezek, ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and fought with him,and smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued him,and took him, and cut off his thumbs, and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>Then said Adoni-bezekSeventy kings, with their thumbs and great toes cut off, have been picking up crumbs under my table, as I have done, so, hath God requited me. And they brought him into Jerusalem, and he died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>And the sons of Judah made war upon Jerusalem, and captured it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,and, the city, they set on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And, afterwards, the sons of Judah went down to make war upon the Canaanites,dwelling in the hill country, and in the south, and in the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites who were dwelling in Hebron, now, the name of Hebron, formerly, was Kiriath-arba,and they smote Sheshai and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And he went from thence, against the inhabitants of Debir,now, the name of Debir, formerly, was Kiriath-sepher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kiriath-sepher, and captureth it, I will give unto him Achsah my daughter, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>Then Othniel, son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother, captured it,and he gave him Achsah his daughter, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came pass, when she came, that she moved him to ask of her father a field, and, when she alighted from off the ass, Caleb said unto herWhat aileth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said unto himGive me a present; for, south land, hast thou given me, give me therefore pools of water. So Caleb gave her Upper-pools, and Lower-pools.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>Now, the sons of the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses, had come up from the city of palm-trees, with the sons of Judah, into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad,so they went and dwelt with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>Then went Judah, with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites dwelling in Zephath,and devoted it to destruction, and the name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>And Judah captured Gaza with the boundaries thereof, and Ashkelon, with the boundaries thereof,and Ekron, with the boundaries thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And it same to pass that Yahweh was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country,but did not dispossess the inhabitants of the vale, because they had, chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>So they gave unto Caleb Hebron, as spake Moses,and he drave out from thence the three sons of Anak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>But, the Jebusites dwelling in Jerusalem, the sons of Benjamin did not drive out,but the Jebusites have dwelt with the sons of Benjamin, in Jerusalem, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>Then went up the house of Josephthey also,unto Bethel,and, Yahweh, was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel,now, the name of the city, formerly, was, Luz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>So the watchers saw a man, coming forth from the city,and they said unto himShew us, we pray thee, the way to get into the city, and we will deal with thee, in lovingkindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And he shewed them the way to get into the city, and they smote the city, with the edge of the sword,but, the man and all his family, they let go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites,and built a city, and called the name thereof, Luz, that, is the name thereof, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>But Manasseh took not possession of Beth-shean and her towns, nor of Taanach and her towns, nor dispossessed the inhabitants of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam, and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo, and her towns,but the Canaanites were determined to remain in this land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>when Israel, however, had waxed strong, they put the Canaanites under tribute,though they, dispossessed, them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>And, Ephraim, dispossessed not the Canaanites who were dwelling in Gezer,so the Canaanites remained in their midst, in Gezer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Zebulun, dispossessed not the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol,but the Canaanites remained in their midst, and came under tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Asher, dispossessed not the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Zidon,nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>but the Asherites dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land,for they dispossessed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Naphtali, dispossessed not the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but they dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land,and, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, and of Beth-anath, became theirs, under tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill country,for they suffered them not to come down into the vale;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>and, though the Amorites were determined to remain in the hill country of Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, yet was the hand of the house of Joseph heavy, so that they came under tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And, the boundary of the Amorites, was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upwards.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And the messenger of Yahweh came up from Gilgal, unto Bochim. And he saidI led you up out of Egypt, and brought you into the land, which I had sworn unto your fathers, And I said, I will not break my covenant with you, to times age-abiding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>But, ye, must not solemnise a covenant with the inhabitants of this land, Their altars, must ye tear down,But ye have not hearkened unto my voice, what is this ye have done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Wherefore also I said, I will not drive them out from before you,but they shall be your adversaries, and, their gods, shall become unto you a snare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it came to pass, when the messenger of Yahweh had spoken these words unto all the sons of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>So they called the name of that place, Bochim, and offered sacrifice there, unto Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>Now, when Joshua had let the people go, the sons of Israel went their way, every man to his inheritance, to take possession of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served Yahweh all the days of Joshua,and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of Yahweh which he had wrought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>So then Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died,being a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him within the bounds of his inheritance, in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim,on the north of Mount Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>All that generation also, were gathered unto their fathers,and there arose another generation, after them, who had not known Yahweh, nor even the work which he had wrought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>So the sons of Israel did the thing that was wicked in the sight of Yahweh,and served the Baals;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>and forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers, who brought them up out of the land of Egypt, and went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were round about them, and bowed themselves down unto them,and angered Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>Yea, they forsook Yahweh,and did service unto the Baal and unto Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>Then kindled the anger of Yahweh upon Israel, and he delivered them into the hand of spoilers, who plundered them,and he sold them into the hand of their enemies round about, so that they could no longer stand before their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Whithersoever they went out, the hand of Yahweh was found to be against them for misfortune, as spake Yahweh, and as sware Yahweh unto them,and they were distressed exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>And, though Yahweh raised up judges,who saved them out of the hand of them that plundered them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>yet, even unto their judges, did thy not hearken, for they went unchastely astray after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them,they turned aside speedily out of the way wherein their fathers who hearkened unto the commandments of Yahweh, walked, they did not so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And, when Yahweh raised them up judges, then was Yahweh with the judges, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies, all the days of the judge,for Yahweh was grieved at their outcry, because of them who oppressed them, and ill-treated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>But, when the judge was dead, they again broke faith more than their fathers, by going their way after other gods, by serving them, and bowing themselves down to them,they ceased not from their doings nor from their stubborn way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>So then the anger of Yahweh kindled upon Israel, and he saidForasmuch as this nation have transgressed my covenant, which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also, will no further dispossess a man from before them,from among the nations which Joshua left remaining, when he died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>that I may, by them, put Israel to the proof,whether they are going to be observant of the way of Yahweh, to walk therein as their fathers observed it, or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>Thus then Yahweh left these nations, not dispossessing them speedily,neither had he delivered them into the hand of Joshua</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now, these, are the nations which Yahweh left, that he might, by them, put Israel to the proof,all who had not known any of the wars of Canaan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>that the generations of the sons of Israel might certainly get to know, by being taught to make war,such, at least, as aforetime knew nothing thereof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Zidonians, and the Hivites dwelling in Mount Lebanon,from Mount Baal-hermon as far as the entering in of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>So then   , that, by them, he might put Israel to the proof,to know whether they would hearken unto the commandments of Yahweh which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And thus, the sons of Israel, dwelt in the midst of the Canaanites,the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>and took their daughters to be their wives, their own daughters moreover, gave they unto their sons, and they served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>Thus did the sons of Israel the thing that was wicked in the sight of Yahweh, and forgat Yahweh their God,and served the Baals and the Asherahs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Then kindled the anger of Yahweh upon Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Chushan-rishathaim, king of Mesopotamia,and the sons of Israel served Chushan-rishathaim, eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And the sons of Israel made outcry unto Yahweh, so Yahweh raised up a saviour unto the sons of Israel, who saved them,even Othniel son of Kenaz, Calebs younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the Spirit of Yahweh came upon him, and he judged Israel, and went out to war, and Yahweh delivered into his hand, Chushan-rishathaim, king of Syria,and his hand prevailed over Chushan-rishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years,and Othniel son of Kenaz, died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the sons of Israel again did the thing that was wicked, in the sight of Yahweh,and Yahweh emboldened Eglon, king of Moab, against Israel, because they did the thing that was wicked in the sight of Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>and he gathered unto him, the sons of Ammon, and Amalek,and came and smote Israel, and took possession of the city of palm-trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>So the sons of Israel served Eglon king of Moab, eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>And the sons of Israel made outcry unto Yahweh, and Yahweh raised up unto them a saviour, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjamite, a man left-handed,and the sons of Israel sent, by his hand, a present, unto Eglon king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>So Ehud made himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length,and girded it under his raiment, upon his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>So he offered the present unto Eglon, king of Moab,now, Eglon, was an exceedingly fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And so it was, when he had made an end of offering the present, that he sent away the people who had been bearing the present;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>but, he himself, turned back from the images that were by Gilgal, and said, A secret word, have I, unto thee, O king! And he saidSilence! Thereupon went out from his presence all who had been standing near him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And, Ehud, came in unto him, he, having been sitting in a summer parlour, which he had for himself, alone, and Ehud said, A divine word, have I, unto thee. So he arose from off his seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from off his right thigh,and thrust it into his body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>and, the handle also, went in after the blade, and the flesh closed upon the blade, for he withdrew not the sword out of his body,and he came out into the ante-chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>And, when Ehud came out into the porch, he closed the doors of the parlour upon him, and bolted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>When, he, had come out, his servants, went in, and looked, and lo! the doors of the parlour were bolted,so they said, Surely he covereth his feet, in the summer chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>But, though they tarried a long time, yet lo! he opened not the doors of the parlour,so they took the key, and opened   , when lo! their lord, fallen to the ground dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>But, Ehud, escaped while they delayed,yea, he, passed the images, and escaped into Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And so it was, when he came, that he blew with a horn, throughout the hill country of Ephraim,and the sons of Israel came down with him, out of the hill country, he, being before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said unto themCome down after me, for Yahweh hath delivered your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand. So they came down after him, and captured the fords of the Jordan, towards Moab, and suffered not a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they smote of Moab, at that time, about ten thousand men, every one a mighty man, and every one a man of valour,and, there escaped not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>And Moab was subdued on that day, under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years, and Ehud judged them until his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And, after him, was Shamgar, son of Anath, who smote of the Philistines, six hundred men, with an ox-goad,and, he also, saved Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the sons of Israel again did the thing that was wicked in the sight of Yahweh,when, Ehud, was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>So Yahweh sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor,now, the prince of his host, was Sisera, and, he, dwelt in Harosheth of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the sons of Israel made outcry unto Yahweh,for he had, nine hundred chariots of iron, and, he, oppressed the sons of Israel heavily, twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>And, Deborah, a woman who was a prophetess, wife of Lapidoth, she, was judging Israel, at that time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>she used to sit, therefore, under the palm-tree of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel, in the hill country of Ephraim,and the sons of Israel came up to her, for justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called for Barak son of Abinoam, out of Kadesh-naphtali,and said unto himHath not Yahweh God of Israel, commanded,Come and draw towards Mount Tabor, and bring with theeten thousand men, of the sons of Naphtali, and of the sons of Zebulun;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>and I will draw unto thee, unto the torrent of Kishon, Sisera, prince of the host of Jabin, with his chariots, and with his multitude,and will deliver him into thy hand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then will I gobut, if thou wilt not go with me, I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she saidI will, go, with thee; only, it shall not be, thine own honour, that shall arise from the journey which thou art about to take, for, into the hand of a woman, will Yahweh sell Sisera. So Deborah arose, and went with Barak, towards Kadesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called together Zebulun and Naphtali, towards Kadesh, and there went up at his feetten thousand men,and Deborah, went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now, Heber the Kenite, had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the sons of Hobab, father-in-law of Moses,and moved his tent as far as the oak of Zaanaim, which is near Kadesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they told Sisera that Barak, son of Abinoam, had gone up to Mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>So Sisera called together all his chariotsnine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him,from Harosheth of the nations, unto the torrent of Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>Then said Deborah unto BarakUp! for, this, is the day on which Yahweh hath delivered Sisera into thy hand, hath not, Yahweh, gone forth before thee? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor, with ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And Yahweh put to flight Sisera and all the chariots and all the host, with the edge of the sword, before Barak,so Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>Now, Barak, pursued the chariots, and the host, as far as Harosheth of the nations,and all the host of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword, there was not left so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>Now, Sisera, had fled on foot, unto the tent of Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin, king of Hazer, and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him: Turn aside, my lord, turn aside with me, do not fear. So he turned aside with her into the tent, and she threw over him a coverlet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said unto herLet me drink, I pray thee, a little water, for I am thirsty. So she opened the bottle of milk, and gave him to drink, and spread over him the coverlet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.1'>And the sons of Israel did the thing that was wicked, in the sight of Yahweh,so Yahweh delivered them into the hand of Midian seven years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.2'>and the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel,because of Midian, did the sons of Israel prepare for themselves the hollows which were in the mountains, and the caves, and the strongholds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.3'>And so it used to be, if Israel had sown, then came up Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east, yea came up against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.4'>and encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of the land, until thou comest unto Gaza,neither left they sustenance in Israel, nor sheep nor ox, nor ass;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.6'>Thus was Israel greatly impoverished, because of Midian,and the sons of Israel made outcry unto Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.7'>And it came to pass, when the sons of Israel cried unto Yahweh,on account of Midian,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.8'>then sent Yahweh a prophet unto the sons of Israel,who said unto themThus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel, I, led you up out of Egypt, and brought you forth out of the house of servants;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.6.11'>Then came the messenger of Yahweh, and sat down under the oak which was in Ophrah, which belonged to Joash, the Abiezrite; and, Gideon his son, was beating out wheat in the winepress, to escape the notice of the Midianites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.12'>so the messenger of Yahweh appeared unto him,and said unto him, Yahweh, is with thee, thou mighty man of valour!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.13'>And Gideon said unto himPardon, my lord! if Yahweh be with us, then wherefore hath all this befallen us? and where are all his wonders, which our fathers have recounted to ussaying, Was it not, out of Egypt, that Yahweh brought us up? But, now, hath Yahweh abandoned us, and delivered us into the hand of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.14'>And Yahweh, turned unto him, and saidGo in this thy might, and thou shalt save Israel, out of the hand of Midian,have I not sent thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.15'>And he said unto himPardon, O my Lord! How, shall I save Israel? Lo! my thousand, is the poorest in Manasseh, and, I, am the youngest in the house of my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.16'>And Yahweh said unto himI will be with thee,so shalt thou smite the Midianites, as one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.17'>And he said unto him, If, I beseech thee, I have found favour in thine eyes, then wilt thou work for me a sign, that it is, thou, who art speaking with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.18'>Do not, I beseech thee, withdraw from hence, until I come unto thee, and bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said: I, will tarry until thou return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.19'>So, Gideon, went in, and made ready a kid of the goats, and, of an ephah of meal, unleavened cakes, the flesh, he put in a basket, and, the broth, he put in a pot,and brought them forth unto him, under the oak, and presented them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.20'>And the messenger of God said unto himTake the flesh and the cakes, and set them on this crag, and, the broth, do thou pour out. And he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.21'>Then the messenger of Yahweh put forth the end of the staff, that was in his hand, and touched the flesh, and the cakes,and there came up fire out of the rock, and consumed the flesh, and the cakes, and, the messenger of Yahweh, had departed out of his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.22'>Then saw Gideon that, the messenger of Yahweh, it was,so Gideon saidAlas, My Lord Yahweh! forasmuch as I have seen the messenger of Yahweh, face to face!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.23'>And Yahweh said unto himPeace be unto thee! Do not fear,thou shalt not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.24'>So Gideon built there an altar unto Yahweh, and called it, Yahweh-shalom. Unto this day, it remaineth, in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.25'>And it came to pass, on that night, that Yahweh said unto himTake the young bullock that belongeth to thy father, even the second bullock of seven years,and throw thou down the altar of Baal, that belongeth to thy father, and, the sacred stem that is by it, shalt thou cut down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.26'>Then shalt thou build an altar, unto Yahweh thy God, on the top of this fort, with the pile,and shalt take the second bullock, and cause it to go up as an ascending-sacrifice, with the wood of the sacred stem which thou shalt cut down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.27'>So Gideon took ten men from among his servants, and did as Yahweh had spoken unto him,and so it was that, as he too much feared the house of his father, and the men of the city, to do it by day, he did it by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.28'>And the men of the city rose up early in the morning, and lo! the altar of Baal, had been overthrown, and, the sacred stem that was by it, had been cut down, and the second bullock had been caused to ascend upon the altar that had been built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.29'>So they said, one to another, Who hath done this thing? And they inquired, and made search, and it was said, Gideon son of Joash, hath done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.30'>So the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring forth thy son, that he may die,because he hath overthrown the altar of Baal, and because he hath cut down the sacred stem that was by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.31'>And Joash said unto all who stood by himWill, ye, plead for Baal, or will, ye, save him? Whoso pleadeth for him, let him be put to death while it is yet morning,if, a god, he be let him plead for himself, because one hath overthrown his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.32'>So he was called on that day, Jerubbaal, saying,Let Baal, plead against him. Because he had overthrown his altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.33'>Now, all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the sons of the east, were gathered together,and they crossed over and pitched in the vale of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.34'>But, the spirit of Yahweh, clothed Gideon,so he blew with a horn, and Abiezer was gathered after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.35'>Messengers also, sent he throughout all Manasseh, and, they also, were gathered after him,messengers also, sent he throughout Asher, and throughout Zebulun, and throughout Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.36'>And Gideon said unto God,If thou art about to bring salvation, by my hand, unto Israel, as thou hast spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.37'>lo! I am placing a woollen fleece, on the threshing-floor,if, dew, be on the fleece alone and, on all the ground, it be dry, then shall I know that thou wilt bring salvation, by my hand, unto Israel, as thou hast spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.38'>And it was so, and he rose up early, on the morrow, and pressed together the fleece,and wrung out the dew from the fleece, a small bowl full of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.39'>Then said Gideon unto God, Let not thine anger kindle upon me, but let me speak, only this once,Let me, I pray thee, put to the proof, only this once, with the fleece, I pray thee, let it be dry on the fleece alone, while, on all the ground, there be dew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.6.40'>And God did so on that night,and it was dry on the fleece alone, while, on all the ground, there was dew.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.7'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.1'>Then Jerubbaal, the same, is Gideon, and all the people that were with him, rose up early, and encamped by the fountain of Harod,and, the camp of Midian, was on the north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the vale.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.2'>And Yahweh said unto Gideon, Too many, are the people that are with thee, for me to deliver the Midianites into their hand,lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand, hath saved me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.3'>Now, therefore, proclaim, I pray thee, in the ears of the people, saying, Whoso feareth and tremblethlet him turn and go hack from Mount Gilead. And there returned of the people twenty-two thousand, and, ten thousand, remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.4'>Then said Yahweh unto GideonYet, are the people too many, take them down unto the waters, that I may prove them for thee, there,and it shall be, that, he of whom I say unto thee, This one, shall go with thee, the same, shall go with thee, and, every one of whom I say unto thee, This one, shall not go with thee, the same, shall not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.5'>So he took down the people unto the waters,and Yahweh said unto GideonEvery one that lappeth with his tongue of the water, as a dog lappeth, thou shalt set him by himself, likewise, every one that boweth down upon his knees, to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.6'>And so it was, that, the number of them that lapped with their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men,but, all the rest of the people, bowed down on their knees, to drink water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.7'>Then said Yahweh unto GideonBy the three hundred men that lapped, will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thy hand; and let, all   the people, go every man to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.8'>So the people took provisions in their hand, and their horns, but, every man of Israel besides, sent he away every man to his home, whereas, the three hundred men, he retained. Now, the camp of Midian, was beneath him in the vale.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.9'>And it came to pass, on that night, that Yahweh said unto him, Arise! go down against the camp,for I have delivered it into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.10'>Or, if, thou, art afraid to go down, go downthou and Purah thy young man, unto the camp;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.11'>so shalt thou hear what they shall say,and, afterward, shall thy hands grow strong, and thou shalt go down against the camp. Then went he down, he and Purah his young man, unto the outmost part of the armed men that were in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.12'>Now, the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east, were lying along in the vale, like locusts for multitude,their camels also, were without number, as the sand that is by the sea side, for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.13'>And Gideon came in, and lo! a man relating to his neighbour a dream,and he saidLo! a dream, have I dreamt, and lo! a round cake of barley bread tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came as far as the tentand smote it that it fell, and turned it upside down, and the tent lay along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.14'>Then responded his neighbour and said:Nothing else, is this, than the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel,God hath delivered into his hand, both Midian and all the host.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.15'>And it was so, when Gideon heard the story of the dream, and the interpretation thereof, that he bowed himself down,and returned unto the camp of Israel, and saidArise! for Yahweh hath delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.16'>And he divided the three hundred men, into three companies,and put horns into the hands of them all, with empty pitchers, and torches inside the pitchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.17'>Then he said unto them, On me, shall ye look, and, in like manner, shall ye do,and lo! when I am coming unto the outermost part of the camp, then shall it be, that, as I do, so, shall ye do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.18'>When I shall blow with the horn, I and all who are with me, then shall, ye also, round about all the camp, blow with your horns, and shall say, For Yahweh and for Gideon!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.20'>Yea the three companies blew with the horns, and shivered the pitchers, and caught holdwith their left handsof the torches, while, in their right hands, were the horns, to blow with,and they cried, A sword for Yahweh, and for Gideon!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.21'>And they stood still, every man in his place, round about the camp,and all the host ran and shouted, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.22'>When the three hundred blew the horns, Yahweh set the sword of every man, against his neighbour, and against all the host,and the host fled, as far as the Place of Acacias, towards Zererath, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.23'>And the men of Israel were called together, out of Naphtali and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh,and pursued Midian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.7.24'>And, messengers, did Gideon send through all the hill country of Ephraim, sayingGo down to meet Midian, and capture, before them, the waters, as far as Beth-barah, and the Jordan.

        <verse osisID='Judg.7.25'>And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and slew Oreb at Orebs Rock, and, Zeeb, they slew at Zeebs Winepress, and pursued Midian,and, the heads of Oreb and Zeeb, brought they in unto Gideon at the ford of the Jordan.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.8'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.1'>And the men of Ephraim said unto himWhat is this thing thou hast done to us, in not calling us, when thou wentest to fight with Midian? And they did chide with him, sharply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.2'>And he said unto them, What have I done, now, in comparison with you? Is not the grape-gleaning of Ephraim better than the vintage of Abiezer?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.8.3'>Into your hand, hath God delivered the princes of MidianOreb and Zeeb, what then had I been able to do in comparison with you? Then, was their spirit softened toward him, when he had spoken this word.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.8.16'>So he took the elders of the city, and the thorns of the wilderness and the nettles, and taught therewith the men of Succoth:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.8.27'>And Gideon made thereof an Ephod, and set it up in his own city, in Ophrah, and all Israel went unchastely astray after it there,so it became, to Gideon and to his house, a snare.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.9.49'>So, even all the people cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and laid them over the basement, and set it on fire over them who were therein,even all the men of the tower of Shechem died about a thousand men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.50'>Then went Abimelech unto Thebez,and encamped against Thebez, and captured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.51'>Now, a strong tower, was in the midst of the city, and there fled thither all the men and the women, and all the owners of the city, and shut themselves in,and went up on the roof of the tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.52'>And Abimelech came in as far as the tower, and fought against it,and so came near, as far as the entrance of the tower, to burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.53'>And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon the head of Abimelech,and brake in pieces his skull.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.9.55'>And, when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was, dead, they went their way every man to his own place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.20.39'>So, when the men of Israel turned in the battle,and, the Benjamites, began to smite and slay of the sons of Israel, about thirty men, for they said, Yea! they are, smitten, before us, as in the first battle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.40'>then, the cloud, began to ascend out of the city, a pillar of smoke,and the Benjamites looked behind them, and lo! the whole city flamed up towards the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.41'>And, when, the men of Israel, turned, then were the men of Benjamin dismayed,for they saw that disaster had overtaken them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.42'>And, when they turned before the men of Israel unto the way of the desert, the battle, over took them,while, as for them that came out of the cities, they began to destroy them in their midst:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.43'>they hemmed in the Benjamites, they pursued them, with ease, trode they them down,as far as over against Gibeah, towards sunrise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.44'>So there fell of Benjamin, eighteen thousand men,all these being men of valour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.45'>And, when they turned and fled towards the desert unto the cliff Rimmon, then gleaned they of them, in the highways, five thousand men,and they followed hard after them as far as Gidom, and smote of them, two thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.46'>So then it came to pass that, all the fallen of Benjamin, were twenty-five thousand men, that drew the sword, on that day,all these being men of valour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.47'>But there turned and fled, towards the desert, unto the cliff Rimmon, six hundred men,who abode in the cliff Rimmon, four months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.20.48'>Thus, the men of Israel, turned against the sons of Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, beginning with the city, each and every one down to the beast, even to every one that was met with,moreover, all the cities they came to, they set on fire.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.21'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.1'>Now, the men of Israel, had sworn in Mizpah, saying,Not a man from among us, shall give his daughter unto Benjamin, to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.2'>So then the people came to Bethel, and abode there, until the evening, before God,and lifted up their voice, and wept bitterly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.3'>and said, Wherefore, O Yahweh, God of Israel, hath this come about in Israel,that there should be lacking, to-day, out of Israel, one tribe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.4'>And it came to pass, on the morrow, that the people rose early, and built there, an altar,and offered ascending-sacrifices, and peace-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.5'>And the sons of Israel said, Who was there that came not up, in the convocation, out of all the tribes of Israel, unto Yahweh? For, the great oath, had been taken, as to any who came not up unto Yahweh at Mizpah, sayingHe shall be, put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.6'>And the sons of Israel grieved for Benjamin, their brother,and they said, There is cut off, to-day, one tribe out of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.7'>What are we to do for them who remain, for wives,seeing that, we ourselves, have sworn by Yahweh, not to give them of our daughters, for wives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.8'>So they said, What one of the tribes of Israel is there, that hath not come up unto Yahweh at Mizpah? And lo! no man had come into the camp, out of Jabesh-gilead, unto the convocation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.9'>When the people were numbered, lo! there was not there a man of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.10'>So the assembly sent thither twelve thousand men, of the sons of valour,and commanded them, saying:Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead, with the edge of the sword, with the women, and the little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.11'>And, this, is the thing that ye shall do,Every male, and every woman that hath cohabited with man, shall ye devote to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.12'>And they foundof the inhabitants of Jabesh-gileadfour hundred young women, virgins, who had not cohabited with man,so they brought them into the camp, at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.13'>Then the whole assembly sent, and spake unto the sons of Benjamin, who were in the cliff Rimmon,and proclaimed to them, peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.14'>So Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead,but they found not for them   , even so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.15'>Now, the assembly, had grieved for Benjamin,because Yahweh had made a breach, in the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.16'>So then, the elders of the assembly said, What are we to do for them who remain, for wives,for womankind, hath been destroyed out of Benjamin?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.17'>And they said, There is an inheritance for the escaped of Benjamin,and there must not be wiped out, a tribe, out of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.18'>Yet, we, may not give them wives, of our own daughters, For the sons of Israel had sworn, saying, Cursed, be he that giveth a wife to Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.19'>Then said theyLo! the festival of Yahweh in Shiloh, from year to year, Which   is on the north of Bethel, towards sunrise, by the highway that goeth up from Bethel, towards Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.20'>And they commanded the sons of Benjamin, saying,Go and lie in wait in the vineyards;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.21'>and look, and lo! if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then shall ye come forth out of the vineyards, and catch you every man his wife, of the daughters of Shiloh,and go your way to the land of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.22'>And it shall be, when their fathers, or their brethren, come in to complain to us, that we will say unto themAs a favour to us, grant them, because we took not for each man his wife in the battle,for, ye yourselves, gave them not unto them, so as, now, to be guilty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.23'>And the sons of Benjamin did so, and carried off wives, according to their number, of them who were dancing, whom they seized,and they went their way, and returned unto their inheritance, and built the cities, and dwelt therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.24'>And the sons of Israel at that time went their several ways from thence, every man to his own tribe, and to his own family,yea they went forth from thence, every man to his own inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.21.25'>In those days, there was no king in Israel,every man did, that which was right in his own eyes.</verse>
