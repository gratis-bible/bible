      <chapter osisID='Joel.1'>
        <title>Samaria, shall be held guilty, for she hath rebelled against her God, By the sword, shall they fall, their infants, shall be dashed to the ground, and, his women with child, shall be ripped up.</title>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.1'>The word of Yahweh, which came unto Joel, son of Pethuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.2'>Hear this, ye elders, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the land,hath this ever happened in your days? or in the days of your fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.3'>Concerning it, to your children, tell ye the story,and your children, to their children, and their children, to the generation following:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.4'>That which was left by the creeping locust, hath the swarming locust eaten, and, that which was left by the swarming locust, hath the grass locust eaten; and, that which was left by the grass locust, hath the corn locust eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.5'>Awake, ye drunkards, and weep, and howl, all ye drinkers of wine,over the new wine, because it hath been cut off from your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.6'>For, a nation, hath come up over my land, bold, and without number,his teeth, are the teeth of a lion, and, the fangs of a lioness, hath he!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.7'>He hath turned my vine to a waste, and my fig-tree to splinters,he hath, barked it clean, and cast it down, bleached are its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.8'>Wail thou, like a virgin girded with sackcloth, for the owner of her youth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.9'>Cut off are the meal-offering and the drink-offering, from the house of Yahweh,In grief are the priests, the attendants on Yahweh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.10'>Laid waste is the field, in grief is the soil,for laid waste is the corn, abashed is the new wine, languisheth the oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.11'>Turn pale, ye husbandmen, howl, ye vinedressers, over the wheat, and over the barley,for perished is the harvest of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.12'>The vine, is abashed, and, the fig-tree, languisheth,pomegranate, palm also, and appleall the trees of the field, have withered, Yea abashed is gladness, away from the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.13'>Gird yourselves and beat the breastye priests, howl, ye attendants of the altar, go in and wrap yourselves for the night in sackcloth, ye attendants on my God,for, withholden from the house of your God, are the meal-offering and the drink- offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.14'>Hallow ye a fast, Call a solemn assembly, Gather, O elders, all the inhabitants of the land, unto the house of Yahweh your God,and make ye outcry unto Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.15'>Alas for the day! For near is the day of Yahweh, and, as a veritable Destruction from the Destroyer, shall it come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.16'>Is it not, before our eyes, that, food, hath been cut off? From the house of our God, rejoicing and exultation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.17'>Rotted hath the seed, under their clods, Laid waste are their stores, Thrown down are the garners,Yea abashed is the corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.18'>How do the beasts groan! Perplexed are the herds of oxen, because there is no pasture for them,even, the flocks of sheep, are destroyed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.19'>Unto thee, O Yahweh, will I cry,for, a fire, hath consumed the pastures of the wilderness, and, a flame, hath set ablaze all the trees of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.20'>Even the beasts of the field, moan unto thee,because dried up are the channels of water, and, a fire, hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.2'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.1'>Blow ye a horn in Zion, sound an alarm in my holy mountain, let all the inhabitants of the land, tremble,for coming is the day of Yahweh, for it is near!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.2'>A day of obscurity and deep gloom, a day of cloud, and thick darkness, as dusk, spread over the mountains,a people, many and bold, like whom, hath not been from age-past times, and, after whom, shall not be again unto the years of generation after generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.3'>Before him, hath a fire, devoured, and, after him, shall a flame, consume,As the garden of Eden, is the land before him, but, after him, a desert most desolate, Moreover also, escape, giveth he none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.4'>As the appearance of horses, is his appearance, and, as war-horses, so, shall they run:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.5'>Like the noise of chariots on the tops of the mountains, shall they rattle along, like the noise of a flame of fire, devouring dry straw,like a people bold, arrayed for battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.6'>Because of him, shall peoples, be in anguish,all faces, have withdrawn their colour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.7'>Like heroes, shall they run, like men of war, shall they mount a wall,and, every onealong his own road, shall they march along, and shall not change their paths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.8'>Nor, against each other, shall they strike, Eachon his own highway, shall they march,though, in among the weapons, they fall, they shall not stop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.9'>Upon the city, shall they leap, on the wall, shall they run, up the houses, shall they climb,through the windows, shall they enter, like a thief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.10'>Before him, hath quaked the earth, have trembled the heavens,the sun and the moon, have become dark, and, the stars, have withdrawn their shining;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.11'>And, Yahweh, hath uttered his voice, before his host, for great indeed is his camp, for bold is he who executeth his word,for great is the day of Yahweh, and awful exceedingly, Who then shall endure it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.12'>Even now, therefore, urgeth Yahweh, Turn ye unto me, with all your heart,and with fasting and with weeping, and with lamentation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.13'>And rend your heart, and not your garments, turn therefore, unto Yahweh your God,for, gracious and full of compassion, is he, slow to anger, and abundant in loving- kindness, and will grieve over calamity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.14'>Who knoweth, he may turn and grieve,and leave behind him, a blessing, a meal-offering and a drink-offering, to Yahweh your God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.15'>Blow ye a horn, in Zion,hallow a fast, call a solemn assembly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.16'>Gather the people, hallow a convocation, collect the elders, gather the children, and the sucklings of the breasts,let the bridegroom, come forth, from his chamber, and the bride from her bower:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.17'>Between the porch and the altar, let the priests, weep, the attendants of Yahweh,and let them sayLook with pity, O Yahweh, upon thy people, and do not deliver thine inheritance to reproach, that the nations, should mock them, Why should they say among the peoples, Where is their God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.18'>And Yahweh became jealous for his land,and took pity on his people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.19'>Then answered Yahweh, and said to his people:Behold me! sending you the corn, and the new wine and the oil, so shall ye be satisfied therewith; and I will not make you, any more, a reproach among the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.20'>And, the Northerner, will I remove far from you, and drive him into a land parched and desolate, with, his face, toward the eastern sea, and, his rear, toward the hinder sea,then shall come up his ill odour, yea his stench, shall ascend, because he hath shown himself great in doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.21'>Be not thou afraid, O soil,exult and rejoice, because Yahweh, hath shown himself great, in doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.22'>Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field, for sprouted have the pastures of the wilderness,for, the tree, hath borne its fruit, the fig-tree and the vine, have yielded their wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.23'>Ye sons of Zion, then, exult and be glad in Yahweh your God, for he hath given you the seed-rain, in right manner,Yea he hath caused to descend for you a down-pour, of seed-rain and of the harvest-rain in the first month;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.24'>So shall the threshing-floors, be filled, with corn,and the vats, overflow, with new wine and oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.25'>Then will I make good to you the years which were eaten by the swarming locust, the grass locust, and the corn locust and the creeping locust,even my great army, which I sent among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.26'>And ye shall eat and eat, and be satisfied, and shall praise the name of Yahweh your God, who hath dealt with you wondrously,so shall my people, not be abashed, unto times age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.27'>So shall ye know that, in the midst of Israel, I am, and that, I, Yahweh, am your God, and none else,and my people, shall not be abashed, unto times age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.28'>And it shall come to pass, afterwards, I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters, shall prophesy,your old men, shall dream, dreams, your young men, shall see, visions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.29'>Moreover also, upon the servants and upon the handmaidsin those days, will I pour out my spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.30'>And I will set forth wonders in the heavens, and in the earth,blood, and fire, and columns of smoke:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.31'>The sun, shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood,before the coming of the great and awful day of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.32'>And it shall come to pass, whosoever, shall call on the name of Yahweh, shall be delivered,For in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, shall be a delivered remnant, just as Yahweh hath said, and among the survivors, whom Yahweh doth call.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.3'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.1'>For lo! in those days, and at that time,when I shall bring back the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.2'>Then will I gather all the nations, and bring them down into the Vale of Jehoshaphat,and will enter into judgment with them there, concerning my people, and mine inheritance Israel, whom they scattered among the nations, and, my land, they apportioned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.3'>And, for my people, they cast lots,and gave a boy for a harlot, and a girl sold they for wineand drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.4'>Moreover also, what have, ye, to do with me, O Tyre and Zidon, and all the circuit of Palestine? A recompense, are ye paying back unto me? But, though ye should make a recompense unto me, swiftly, speedily, would I return your recompense upon your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.5'>Because, my silver and my gold, ye took away,and, my richly beautiful things, carried ye into your temples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.6'>And, the sons of Judah and the sons of Jerusalem, ye sold to the sons of Greece,that they might be far removed from their own boundary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.7'>Behold me! rousing them up out of the place whither ye sold them,So will I bring back your dealing upon your own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.8'>And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of the sons of Judah, and they will sell them to Sabeans, unto a nation afar off,for, Yahweh, hath spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.9'>Proclaim ye this, among the nations, Hallow a war, rouse the mighty ones, let them draw near, come up, all the men of war!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.10'>Beat your plough-shares into swords, and your pruning-hooks into spears,as for the weak, let him say, mighty, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.11'>Give helpand come in, all ye nations on every side, and gather yourselves together,Thither, bring down, O Yahweh, thy mighty ones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.12'>Let the nations, be roused, and come up, into the Vale of Jehoshaphat,for, there, will I sit to judge all the nations, on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.13'>Thrust ye in the vintage knife, for, grown ripe, is the vintage,Go in, tread down, for full is the winepress, flow over do the vats, for abundant is their wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.14'>Multitudes, multitudes, in the vale of strict decision,for near is the day of Yahweh, in the vale of strict decision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.15'>The sun and the moon, have become dark,and, the stars, have withdrawn their shining,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.16'>And, Yahweh, out of Zion, will roar, and, out of Jerusalem, will utter his voice, and the heavens and the earth, shall tremble,but, Yahweh, shall be a shelter to his people, and a refuge to the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.17'>So shall ye know that, I, Yahweh, am your God, making my habitation in Zion my holy mountain,So shall, Jerusalem, be, holy, and, foreigners, shall pass through her no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.18'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains shall drip sweet wine, and the hills shall flow down with milk, and, all the channels of Judah, shall flow down with waters,and, a spring, out of the house of Yahweh, shall come forth, and shall water the torrent-valley of the acacias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.19'>Egypt, to a desolation, shall be turned, and, Edom, to a desert most desolate, shall be changed,because of the violence done to the sons of Judah, in that they shed innocent blood in their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.20'>But, Judah, age-abidingly, shall remain, and, Jerusalem, to generation after generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.21'>And I will free from their blood-guiltiness them whom I had not freed,for, Yahweh, is about to make his habitation in Zion.</verse>
