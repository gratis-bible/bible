        <title>How happy art thou, O Israel! Who is like unto thee, O people victorious in Yahweh? Thy helpful shield, who also is thy majestic sword,So that thy foes come cringing unto thee, And, thou, upon their heights, dost march along.</title>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>And it came to pass, after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh,that Yahweh spake unto Joshua son of Nun, the attendant of Moses, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant, is dead,Now, therefore, arise, pass over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, into the land which I am giving unto themunto the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread, unto you, have I given it,as I spake unto Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the desert and this Lebanon, even unto the great riverthe river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and unto the great sea, toward the going in of the sun, shall be your boundary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>No man shall stand before thee, all the days of thy life,as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee, I will not fail thee, neither will I forsake thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be firm and bold,for, thou, shalt cause this people to inherit the land which I sware unto their fathers,to give unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be very firm and bold, taking heed to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee, do not turn aside therefrom, to the right hand or to the left,that thou mayest prosper, whithersoever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This scroll of the law must not cease out of thy mouth, but thou must talk to thyself therein, day and night, that thou mayest take heed to do according to all that is written therein,for, then, shalt thou make thy way prosperous, and, then, shalt thou have good success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have I not commanded thee, Be firm and bold, do not start nor be dismayed,for, with thee, is Yahweh thy God, whithersoever thou goest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>So then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass ye through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying: Make ready for yourselves, provisions,for, in three days more, are ye to pass over this Jordan, to go in and possess the land which Yahweh your God is giving you, to possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And, unto the Reubenites, and unto the Gadites, and unto the half tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying,Yahweh your God, is granting you rest, and doth give you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in the land which Moses hath given you over the Jordan,but, ye, shall pass over, armed, before your brethren,all ye mighty men of valour, and shall help them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>until that Yahweh shall grant rest unto your brethren, as unto you, so shall, they also, possess the land which Yahweh your God giveth them,then shall ye return unto the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh hath given you over the Jordan, towards the rising of the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>Then responded they to Joshua, saying,All that thou hast commanded us, will we do, and, whithersoever thou shalt send us, will we go:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>As in every thing we hearkened unto Moses, so, will we hearken unto thee,only let Yahweh thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Any man who shall rebel against thy bidding, and not hearken unto thy words in all that thou shalt command him, shall be put to death,only be firm and bold.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>Then did Joshua son of Nun, send out from The Acacias, two men to spy out silently, saying, Go view the land, and Jericho. So they came, and entered the house of a harlot, whose name was Rahab, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying,Lo! men, have come in hither to-night of the sons of Israel to search out the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>So the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying,Bring forth the men that are come in unto thee who have entered thy house, for, to search out all the land, have they come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman took the two men and hid them,and said: Even so, the men did come in unto me, but I knew not from whence they were;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>and it came to pass, as the gate was about to be shut in the darkness, that, the men, went out, I know not whither the men went,pursue them quickly for ye shall overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But, she, had taken them up to the roof,and concealed them with the stalks of flax which she had laid in order for herself upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>So, the men, pursued them by way of the Jordan unto the fords,the gate being shut as soon as they who pursued them had gone forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And, ere yet they slept, she, went up unto them, upon the roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>and said unto the men, I know that Yahweh hath given unto you the land,and that the terror of you hath fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land, have melted away, from before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how Yahweh, dried up, the waters of the Red Sea from before you, when ye came forth out of Egypt,and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites who were over the Jordan unto Sihon and unto Og, whom ye devoted to destruction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>and, when we heard, then did our heart melt, and there rose up no longer any spirit in any man because of you,for, as for Yahweh your God, he, is Godin the heavens above, and upon the earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now, therefore I pray you, swear unto me by Yahweh, since I have dealt with you in lovingkindness, that, ye also, will deal with the house of my father in lovingkindness, and will give me a token of faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>and will save alive my father and my mother, and my brethren and my sisters, and all that they have,and will deliver our souls from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men said unto her, Our souls in your stead unto death, if ye utter not this our business,so shall it be, when Yahweh shall give us the land, that we will deal with thee in lovingkindness and in faithfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>And she let them down with a cord through the window,for, her house, was within the wall of the rampart, and, within the rampart, she was dwelling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said unto themTo the mountain, get you, lest the pursuers, fall in, with you,and hide yourselves there, three days until the pursuers return, and, afterwards, shall ye go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said unto her,Free, will we be from this thine oath which thou hast made us swear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Lo! when we are coming into the land, this cord of crimson thread, must thou bind in the window by which thou didst let us down, and, thy father and thy mother and thy brethren and all the household of thy father, must thou gather together unto thee unto the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be, whosoever shall go forth out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood, shall be on his own head and, we, shall be free,but, whosoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood, shall be on our heads, if a, hand, be upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>Or, if thou utter this our business, then shall we be free from this thine oath which thou hast made us swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she saidAccording to your words, so, shall it be. Thus sent she them away and they departed,and she bound the crimson cord in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they went and came into the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers had returned,so the pursuers, made search, throughout all the way, but found them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>And the two men returned and came down out of the mountain, and crossed over and came unto Joshua, son of Nun,and recounted to him all that had befallen them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>and they said unto Joshua, Yahweh, hath delivered, into our hand all the land,moreover also all the inhabitants of the land, have melted away, from before us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>So then Joshua rose early in the morning, and they brake up from The Acacias and came as far as the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel,and they lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass, after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>and commanded the people saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, and, the priests the Levites, bearing it, ye also, shall break up out of your place, and come after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet shall there be, a distance, between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure,do not come near unto it that ye may get to know the way by which ye must go, for ye have not passed this way, heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>Then said Joshua unto the people, Hallow yourselves,for, to-morrow, will Yahweh do in your midst, wonderful things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take ye up the ark of the covenant, and pass on before the people. So they took up the ark of the covenant, and went on before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>Then said Yahweh unto Joshua: This day, will I begin to magnify thee in the eyes of all Israel,who shall know, that, as I was with Moses, I will be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>Thou, therefore, shalt command the priests who am bearing the ark of the covenant, saying,When ye are come as far as the edge of the waters of the Jordan, in the Jordan, shall ye stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>Then said Joshua, unto the sons of Israel,Draw near hither, and hear ye the words of Yahweh your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, Hereby, shall ye know, that a Living GOD is in your midst,and that he will, certainly dispossess, from before you, the Canaanite and the Hittite, and the Hivite and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Lo! the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth, is about to pass before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now, therefore, take you twelve men, out of the tribes of Israel,one man severally for each tribe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>and it shall be, when the soles of the feet of the priests who are bearing the ark of Yahweh, Lord of all the earth, do rest, in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan, shall be cut off, the waters that are coming down from above,and shall stand in one mound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it came to pass, when the people set out from their tents, to cross the Jordan,with the priests, bearing the ark of the covenant before the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>then, as the bearers of the ark came as far as the Jordan, and, the feet of the priests who were bearing the ark, were dipped in the edge of the waters,the Jordan being full over all his banks, all the days of harvest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>that the waters which were coming down from above, stoodrose up in one mound, a great way off, by the city Adam, which is beside Zarethan, and, they which were going down to the sea of the waste plain, the salt sea, failedwere cut off,and, the people, passed over, right against Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests who were bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, stood on dry ground, in the midst of the Jordan, with firm footing,while all Israel were passing over on dry ground, until all the nation had made an end of passing over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass, when all the nation had made an end of passing over the Jordan, that Yahweh slake unto Joshua, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take unto you, from among the people, twelve men, one man severally from each tribe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>and command ye them, saying, Take you up from hence, out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where stood the feet of the priests with firm footing, twelve stones;and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall lodge, tonight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>So Joshua called unto the twelve men whom he had made ready, from among the sons of Israel,one man severally out of each tribe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>and Joshua said unto them: Pass ye over, before the ark of Yahweh your God, into the midst of the Jordan,and lift ye up, each man one stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>that this may be a sign in your midst,for your sons will ask in time to come, saying, What mean these stones to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then shall ye say unto themThat the waters of the Jordan, were cut off, from before the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, when it passed into the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan, were cut off. So shall these stones become a memorial unto the sons of Israel, unto times age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the sons of Israel did so, as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as spake Yahweh unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,and carried them with them unto the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>Twelve stones also, did Joshua set up in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where stood the feet of the priests who were bearing the ark of the covenant,and they have remained there until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>Now, the priests who were bearing the ark, continued standing in the midst of the Jordan, until everything was finished which Yahweh commanded Joshua, to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua,the people therefore hasted, and passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And so it was, as soon as all the people had made an end of passing over,then passed over the ark of Yahweh, and the priests, in presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>Also the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the hall tribe of Manasseh, passed over, armed, before the sons of Israel,as Moses had spoken unto them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>about forty thousand, equipped for the war, passed over before Yahweh, to battle, into the waste plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day, did Yahweh magnify Joshua in the eyes of all Israel,and they revered him, as they revered Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>Then spake Yahweh unto Joshua, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests who are bearing the ark of testimony,that they come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>So Joshua commanded the priests, saying,Come ye up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass, when the priests who were bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh came up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the feet of the priests were withdrawn unto the dry ground, then returned the waters of the Jordan unto their place, and went, as before, over all his banks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>So, the people, came up out of the Jordan, on the tenth of the first month,and encamped in Gilgal, at the eastern end of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And, these twelve stones which they took out of the Jordan, did Joshua set up, in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>Then spake he unto the sons of Israel, saying,When your sons shall ask, in time to come, of their fathers, saying,What mean these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>then shall ye let your sons know, saying,On dry ground, came Israel over this Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>in that Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan, from before you, until ye had passed over,as Yahweh your God had done unto the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we had passed over:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>that all the peoples of the earth might know the hand of Yahweh, that, firm, it is; that they might revere Yahweh your God, all the days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites who were over the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard how that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan, from before the sons of Israel, until they had passed over, that their heart melted, and there was no spirit in them any more, because of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time, said Yahweh unto Joshua, Make thee knives of flint,and again circumcise the sons of Israel, a second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>So Joshua made him knives of flint,and circumcised the sons of Israel, at the Hill of Foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>Now, this, is the cause why Joshua did circumcise,all the people who came forth out of Egypt, who were males, all the men of war, died in the desert, by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>For, though all the people who came forth had been circumcised, yet, all the people who were born in the desert by the way, after they came forth out of Egypt, had they not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>Because, for forty years, did the sons of Israel journey in the desert, until all the nation who were men of war, who came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they hearkened not unto the voice of Yahweh,unto whom Yahweh sware that he would not let them see the land, which Yahweh sware unto their fathers, that he would give unto us, a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>Their sons, therefore, whom he had raised up in their stead, them, did Joshua circumcise,for, uncircumcised, they were, in that they had not circumcised them by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And so it came to pass, when they had made an end of circumcising all the nation, they remained in their place, in the camp, until they were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>Then said Yahweh unto Joshua, To-day, have I rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of that place is called Gilgal unto this day. \fs15</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>Thus then the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal,and kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the month, in the evening, in the waste plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they did eat of the corn of the land, on the morrow of the passover, unleavened cakes and parched ears of corn,on this selfsame day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the morrow, when they had eaten of the corn of the land, neither had the sons of Israel manna any more,so they did eat of the yield of the land of Canaan throughout that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass, while Joshua was at Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes, and looked, and lo! a man standing over against him, with his sword drawn, in his hand,so Joshua went unto him, and said to him, For us, art thou, or for our adversaries?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he saidNay, but, I, as prince of the host of Yahweh, have, now, come. So Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshipped, and said unto him, What is my lord speaking unto his servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>Then said the prince of the host of Yahweh unto JoshuaSlip off thy sandals from thy feet, for, as for the place whereon thou art standing, holy, it is. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now, Jericho, was shut up and barred because of the sons of Israel,none came out and none went in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>Then said Yahweh unto Joshua, See, I have delivered, into thy hand, Jericho and her king,the mighty men of valour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>So then ye shall compass the city all ye men of war, going round the city, once,thus, shall thou do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And, seven priests, shall bear the seven rams horns before the ark, and, on the seventh day, shall ye compass the city seven times,and, the priests, shall blow with the horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall come to pass, when the rams horn soundeth, when ye hear the sound of the horn, that all the people shall shout with a great shout,and then shall the wall of the city fall down under it, and the people shall go up, every man straight before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>Then called Joshua son of Nun unto the priests, and said unto them, Bear ye the ark of the covenant,and let, seven priest, bear seven rams horns, before the ark of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>Then said he unto the people, Pass on and compass the city,and let, the armed host, pass on before the ark of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it was so, when Joshua had spoken unto the people, that, the seven priests who were bearing the seven rams horns before Yahweh, passed on and blew with the horns,the ark of the covenant of Yahweh also coming after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And, the armed host, went on before the priests who blew with the horns,and, the rear-guard, came after the ark, going on and blowing with the horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>Now, unto the people, had Joshua given command, sayingYe shall not shout nor let your voice be heard, neither shall there go out of your mouth, a word,until the day when I say unto you Shout! then shall ye shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So he caused the ark of Yahweh to compass the city, going round once,and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua rose early in the morning,and the priests bare the ark of Yahweh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>and, the seven priests who bare the seven rams horns before the ark of Yahweh, went on and on, and blew with the horns,with, the armed host going on before them, and, the rear-guard, coming after the ark of Yahweh, going on and blowing with the horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>So they compassed the city on the second day once, and returned into the camp,thus, did they, six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>And it came to pass, on the seventh day, that they rose early at the uprisings of the dawn, and compassed the city after this manner, seven times,only on that day they compassed the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And it came to pass, at the seventh timewhen the priests blew with the horns, then did Joshua say unto the peopleShout, for Yahweh hath delivered unto you the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And it shall be, that, as for the city, devoted, shall it be and all that is therein unto Yahweh,nevertheless, Rahab the harlot, shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>But, in any wise, do, ye, beware of what is devoted, lest ye should covet, and then take of what is devoted,and so cause the camp of Israel to be devoted, and bring trouble upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>But, as for all silver and gold and vessels of bronze and iron, hallowed, it is to Yahweh,unto the treasury of Yahweh, shall it come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.20'>So the people shouted, when the horns were blown,yea it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the horn, that the people shouted with a great shout, and the wall fell down under it, and the people went up into the city every man straight before him, and so they captured the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.21'>And they devoted all that were in the city, both man and woman, both young and old,and ox and sheep and ass, with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.22'>But, unto the two men who spied out the land, Joshua said, Go into the house of the woman, the harlot,and bring out thence the woman and all that she hath, as ye aware unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.23'>So the young men the spies went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brethren and all that she had, yea, all her kindred, brought they out,and set them outside the camp of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.24'>But, the city, burned they with fire, and all that was therein,save only, the silver and the gold and the vessels of bronze and of iron, put they into the treasury of the house of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.25'>And, Rahab the harlot and the household of her father and all that she had, did Joshua save alive, so she hath dwelt in the midst of Israel until this day,because she hid the messengers whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.26'>And Joshua imposed an oath at that time, saying,Cursed be the man before Yahweh who shall raise up and build this cityJericho, At the price of his firstborn, shall he lay its foundation, and, at the price of his youngest, shall he set up its doors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.27'>And so it was that Yahweh was with Joshua,and his fame was in all the land.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.1'>But the sons of Israel had committed an act of unfaithfulness in respect of what was devoted,for Achan son of Carmi son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah had taken of what was devoted, and the anger of Yahweh had kindled against the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.2'>And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai which was beside Beth-aven on the east side of Bethel, and spake unto them saying, Go up and spy out the land. So the men went up, and spied out Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.3'>And they returned unto Joshua and said unto himLet not all the people go up, about two thousand men or three thousand men, can go up and smite Ai,do not weary the whole people to go thither, for, but few, they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.4'>There went up thither of the people therefore, about three thousand men,but they fled before the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.5'>And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty-six men, and pursued them before the gate as far as the Shebarim, and smote them on the slope,so that the heart of the people melted and became as water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.6'>Then Joshua rent his clothes and fell upon his face to the earth before the ark of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel,and they lifted up dust upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.7'>And Joshua saidAlas! My Lord Yahweh! Wherefore hast thou, brought, this people over the Jordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorite to destroy us? Would then we had been content to dwell on the other side of the Jordan!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.8'>Oh My Lord,what shall I say, after Israel have turned their backs before their enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.9'>Only let the Canaanite and all the inhabitants of the land hear, and they will surround us, and cut off our name out of the earth,what then wilt thou do for thy great name?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.10'>And Yahweh said unto JoshuaGet thee up! wherefore is it that thou art lying upon thy face?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.11'>Israel hath sinned, yea moreover they have transgressed my covenant which I commanded them,yea moreover they have taken of what was devoted, yea moreover they have stolen, yea moreover they have dissembled, yea moreover they have put it among their own goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.12'>Therefore cannot the sons of Israel stand before their enemies, their back, do they turn before their enemies, because they have become devoted,I will no more be with you, except ye destroy the devoted thing out of your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.13'>Up! hallow the people, and thou shalt say, Hallow yourselves by to-morrow,for, Thus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel: A devoted thing, is in the midst of thee O Israel, Thou canst not stand before thine enemies, until ye have put away the devoted thing out of your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.14'>Therefore shall ye be brought near in the morning by your tribes,and it shall be thatthe tribe which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, by families, and the family which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, by households, and the household which Yahweh shall seize, shall come near, man by man;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.7.16'>So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel near by their tribes,and, the tribe of Judah, was seized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.17'>and he brought near the family of Judah, and, the family of the Zarhites, was seized,and he brought near the family of the Zarhites, man by man, and, Zabdi, was seized;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.7.20'>And Achan answered Joshua and said,Of a truth, I, have sinned against Yahweh God of Israel, and, thus and thus, have I done:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.21'>When I saw among the spoil a certain goodly mantle of Babylonia and two hundred shekels of silver and a certain wedge of goldfifty shekels the weight thereof, then I coveted them, then I took them,and, there they are, hid in the earth, in the midst of my tent, and the silver under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.22'>So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent,and, there it was, hid in his tent, and, the silver, under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.23'>And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought them in unto Joshua, and unto all the sons of Israel,and poured them out before Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.24'>And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achanson of Zerah, and the silver and the mantle and the wedge of gold, and his sons and his daughters, and his oxen and his asses and his sheep and his tent, and all that he had, and brought them up the valley of Achor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.7.25'>And Joshua saidWhy hast thou troubled us? Yahweh, will trouble thee, this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones, and burned them up with fire, and covered them with stones;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.8'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.1'>Then said Yahweh unto JoshuaDo not fear nor be dismayed, take with thee all the army, and arise, go up to Ai,see! I have given into thy hand, the king of Ai and his people, and his city, and his land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.2'>so shalt thou do unto Ai and to her king, as thou didst unto Jericho unto her king, save only, the spoil thereof and the cattle thereof, shall ye take as your own prey,set thee an ambush for the city, behind it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.3'>So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up to Ai,and Joshua chose out thirty thousand men, the mighty men of valour, and sent them forth by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.4'>And he commanded them, sayingSee! ye, shall be lying in ambush against the city, behind the city, do not go very far from the city,so shall ye all be ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.5'>But, I, and all the people who are with me, will draw near unto the city,and it shall be, when they come out to meet us, as at the first, then will we flee before them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.6'>so will they come out after us, until we have drawn them away from the city, for they will say, Fleeing before us, as at the first! therefore will we flee before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.7'>Then, ye, shall rise up out of the ambush, and take possession of the city,and Yahweh your God will deliver it into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.8'>And it shall be, when ye have seized the city, then shall ye burn the city with fire, according to the word of Yahweh, shall ye do,see! I have commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.9'>So Joshua sent them forth, and they went into ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west of Ai,but Joshua lodged that night in the midst of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.10'>And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and mustered the people,and went uphe and the elders of Israel, before the people, to Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.11'>And, all the people of war who were with him, went up, and drew near, and came in, right before the city,and pitched on the north of Ai, with, a valley, between them and Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.12'>And he took about five thousand men,and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.13'>And, when the people had set all the host that was on the north of the city, with the rear thereof on the west of the city, then went Joshua, during the night, into the midst of the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.14'>And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they hasted, and rose up early, and the men of the city came out to meet Israel for battle, he and all his people, at an appointed time, before the waste plain,he not knowing that there was an ambush lying in wait for him, behind the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.15'>So then Joshua and all Israel suffered themselves to be smitten before them,and fled, by the way of the wilderness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.16'>and all the people who were in the city were called out to pursue them,and they pursued Joshua, and so were drawn out away from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.17'>And there remained not a man, in Ai or Bethel, who had not gone out after Israel,and they left the city, open, and pursued Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.18'>Then said Yahweh unto JoshuaStretch out with the javelin which is in thy hand, towards Ai, for, into thy hand, will I deliver it. So Joshua stretched out with the javelin which was in his hand, towards the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.19'>And, the ambush, rose up quickly, out of their place, and ran, when he stretched out his hand, and entered the city, and captured it,and hasted, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.20'>And the men of Ai turned behind them, and looked, and lo! the smoke of the city had risen up towards the heavens, and there was in them no strength, to flee this way or that way,moreover, the people that were fleeing to the wilderness, turned back upon the pursuers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.21'>Yea, when, Joshua and all Israel, saw that the ambush had captured the city, and that the smoke of the city had risen up, then returned they, and smote the men of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.22'>And, the others, came forth out of the city to meet them, so they were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on that side,and they smote them, until there was left them none to remain or to escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.23'>And, the king of Ai, they caught alive,and brought him near unto Joshua.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.24'>And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness whither they had pursued them, and all of them had fallen by the edge of the sword until they were consumed, then all Israel returned to Ai, and smote it with the edge of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.25'>And so it was, that all who fell that day, both of men and of women, were twelve thousand,all people of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.26'>Now, Joshua, drew not back his hand which he had stretched out with the javelin,until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.27'>Nevertheless, the cattle and the spoil of that city, Israel took as their own prey,according to the word of Yahweh, which he commanded Joshua.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.8.29'>And, the king of Ai, hanged he on a tree until eventide,but, at the going in of the sun, Joshua gave command and they took down his dead body from the tree, and cast it in at the opening of the gate of the city, and raised up over it a great heap of stones</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.30'>Than, built Joshua, an altar, unto Yahweh, God of Israel,in Mount Ebal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.31'>as Moses, the servant of Yahweh, commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the scroll of the law of Moses, an altar of whole stones, whereon had not been wielded any tool of iron,and they caused to go up thereon, ascending-sacrifices unto Yahweh, and sacrificed peace-offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.32'>Then wrote he there, upon the stones, a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote, in the presence of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.33'>And, all Israel, and their elders and officers, and their judges, were standing on this side and on that side of the ark, before the priests the Levites, who were bearing the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, as well the sojourner as the home-born, half of them over against Mount Gerizim, and half of them over against Mount Ebal,as Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded to bless the sons of Israel, first of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.34'>And, after that, read he all the words of the law, the blessing and the cursing,according to all that was written in the scroll of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.8.35'>Them was not a word of all that Moses commanded,which Joshua read not before all the convocation of Israel, with the women and the little ones, and the sojourner who was going on in their midst.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.9.2'>then gathered they themselves together as one man, to fight with Joshua, and with Israel,with one accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.3'>Now, the inhabitants of Gibeon, heard that which Joshua had done unto Jericho and unto Ai;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.4'>they, however, acted craftily, and went and started,and took old sacks for their asses, and leathern wine bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.5'>and sandals, old and patched, upon their feet, and worn-out mantles upon them,and, all the bread of their provision, was dry and broken.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.9.11'>So our elders and all the inhabitants of our land spake unto us, sayingTake ye, in your hand, provision for the journey, and go your way to meet them,then shall ye say unto them, Your servants, we are. Now, therefore, solemnise with us a covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.12'>This our bread, took we, hot, for our provision, out of our houses, on the day we came forth to journey unto you,but, now, lo! it is dry, yea it is broken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.9.13'>and, these leathern wine bottles, which we filled new, lo! also, they are rent,and, as for these our mantles and our sandals, they are worn out, by reason of the very long journey.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.10.1'>And it came to pass, when Adonizedec, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and devoted it to destruction, as he had done unto Jericho and her king, so, had he done unto Ai and her king,and that the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and had come into their midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.2'>then feared they greatly, because Gibeon was, a great city, as one of the royal cities,and because, it, was greater than Ai, and, all the men thereof, were mighty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.3'>therefore sent Adonizedec, king of Jerusalem, unto Hoham, king of Hebron, and unto Piram, king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia, king of Lachish, and unto Debir, king of Eglon, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.4'>Come up unto me and help me, that we may smite Gibeon,for it hath made peace with Joshua, and with the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.5'>So they gathered themselves together and came up, even the five kings of the Amoritesthe king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon,they, and all their hosts,and encamped near Gibeon, and made war against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.6'>So the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua, unto the camp at Gilgal, saying, Do not withhold thy hand from thy servants,Come up unto us quickly, and save us, and help us, for all the kings of the Amorites that dwell in the hill-country, are gathered together against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.7'>So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, even all the mighty men of valour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.8'>And Yahweh said unto Joshua: Do not fear because of them, for, into thy hand, have I delivered them,not a man of them shall stand before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.9'>So then Joshua came in unto them, suddenly,all the night, came he up, from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.10'>And Yahweh confused them before Israel, and smote them with a great slaughter at Gibeon,and chased them along the way that goeth up Beth-horon, and smote them as far as Azekah and as far as Makkedah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.11'>And it came to pass, when they fled from before Israel, they, being on the slope of Beth-horon, that, Yahweh, cast down upon them great stones out of the heavens, as far as Azekah, and they died,more, were they who died by the hailstones, than they whom the sons of Israel slew with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.12'>Then, spake Joshua unto Yahweh, on the day when Yahweh delivered up the Amorites before the sons of Israel,yea he said, in the presence of IsraelThou Sun! in Gibeon, be still, and thou Moon! in the vale of Aijalon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.13'>So the sun, was still, and, the moon, stayed, until a nation should be avenged on its fees. Is not, that, written in the Book of the Upright? So then the sun stayed in the middle of the heavens, and hastened not to go in, about a whole day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.10.14'>And there was no day like thatbefore it or after it, when Yahweh hearkened unto the voice of a man,in that, Yahweh, himself fought for Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Josh.23.15'>But it shall be that, as all the good things have come unto you, which Yahweh your God spake unto you, so, will Yahweh bring upon you all the evil things, until he hath destroyed you from off this goodly soil, which Yahweh your God hath given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.23.16'>When ye transgress the covenant of Yahweh your God which he hath commanded you, and go and serve other gods, and bow yourselves down unto them, then will the anger of Yahweh kindle upon you, and ye will perish quickly, from off the good land which he hath given unto you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.24'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.1'>And Joshua gathered together all the tribes of Israel, unto Shechem,and called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers, and they presented themselves before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.2'>Then said Joshua unto all the peopleThus, saith Yahweh, God of Israel, Beyond the River, dwelt your fathers from age-past times,   Terah, father of Abraham, and father of Nahor,and they served other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.3'>So I took your father, Abraham, from beyond the River, and led him through all the land of Canaan,and multiplied his seed, and gave unto him, Isaac;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.4'>and gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau,and gave unto Esau, Mount Seir, to possess it, but, Jacob and his sons, went down into Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.5'>Then sent I Moses and Aaron, and plagued Egypt, according to that which I did in their midst, and, afterwards, brought you forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.6'>Yea I brought forth your fathers, out of Egypt, and ye came unto the sea, and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers, with chariots and with horsemen, unto the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.7'>So they made outcry unto Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought in upon them the sea, and covered them,and your eyes beheld what I did with the Egyptians. And, when ye had remained in the desert many days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.8'>then I brought you into the land of the Amorites, who were dwelling over the Jordan, and they fought with you,then delivered I them into your hand, and ye took possession of their land, so I destroyed them from before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.9'>Then rose up Balak, son of Zippor, king of Moab, and made war with Israel,and sent and called for Balaam son of Beor, to curse you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.10'>but I was not willing to hearken unto Balaam,so, he kept on blessing, you, and I rescued you out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.11'>Then passed ye over the Jordan, and came in unto Jericho, and, when they would have made war with youeven the lords of Jerichothe Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, then delivered I them into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.12'>And I sent before you the hornet, which drave them out from before you, the two kings of the Amorites,not with thy sword, nor with thy bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.13'>Thus I gave unto you a land on which thou hadst not laboured, and cities which ye had not built, and ye proceeded to dwell therein,of vineyards and oliveyards, which ye planted not, ye are eating.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.14'>Now, therefore, revere ye Yahweh, and serve him, in sincerity and in truth,and put away the gods which your fathers served beyond the River, and in Egypt, and serve ye Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.15'>But, if it be, a vexation, in your eyes, to serve Yahweh, choose ye for yourselves, to-day, whom ye will serve, whether the gods which your fathers served, that were beyond the River, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye are dwelling,but, I and my house, will serve Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.16'>Then responded the people, and said, Far be it from us, that we should forsake Yahweh,to serve other gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.17'>for, as for Yahweh our God, he, brought up both us and our fathers, out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of servants,and who did before our eyes, these great signs, and preserved us throughout all the way wherein we journeyed, and among all the peoples through the midst of whom we passed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.18'>then did Yahweh drive out all the peoples, even the Amorites were dwelling in the land, from before us,we too, will serve Yahweh, for, he, is our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.19'>Then said Joshua unto the peopleYe cannot serve Yahweh, for, a holy God, he is, a jealous GOD, he is, he will not forgive your transgression, nor your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.20'>When ye forsake Yahweh, and serve the gods of a stranger, then will he turn, and inflict on you calamity, and consume you, after that he hath dealt well with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.21'>But the people said unto Joshua,Nay! but, Yahweh, will we serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.22'>Then said Joshua unto the peopleWitnesses, are ye, against yourselves, that, ye yourselves, have chosen you Yahweh, to serve him. And they said: Witnesses!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.23'>Now, therefore, put ye away the gods of the stranger, that are in your midst,and incline your heart unto Yahweh, God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.24'>And the people said unto Joshua,Yahweh our God, will we serve, and, unto his voice, will we hearken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.25'>So then Joshua solemnised a covenant for the people, on that day,and set for them a statute and a regulation, in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.26'>And Joshua wrote these words in the scroll of the law of God,and took a great stone, and set it up there, under the oak that was by the sanctuary of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.27'>And Joshua said unto all the peopleLo! this stone, shall serve against us as a witness, for, it, hath heard all the sayings of Yahweh, which he hath spoken with us,so shall it serve against you as a witness, lest ye should act deceptively against your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.28'>And Joshua sent the people away, every man unto his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.29'>And it came to pass, after these things, that Joshua son of Nun, servant of Yahweh, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.30'>And they buried him within the bounds of his own inheritance, in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north of Mount Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.31'>So then Israel served Yahweh all the days of Joshua,and all the days of the elders who prolonged their days after Joshua, and who had known all the work of Yahweh, which he had wrought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.32'>And, the bones of Josephwhich the sons of Israel had brought up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in the portion of field, which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of money,and they belonged unto the sons of Joseph, as an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.24.33'>And, Eleazar son of Aaron, died,and they buried him in the hill of Phinehas his son, which was given to him, in the hill country of Ephraim.</verse>
