      <chapter osisID='Dan.1'>
        <title>And it shall be that with whatsoever tribe the sojourner hath become a sojourner, there shall ye give his inheritance, Declareth My Lord Yahweh.</title>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah, came Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Jerusalem, and laid siege against it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>and the Lord gave into his hand Jehoiakim king of Judah, and a part of the vessels of the house of God, and he brought them into the land of Shinar, into the house of his gods,and, the vessels, brought he into the treasure-house of his gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>Then did the king give word to Ashpenaz, the chief of his eunuchs,that he should bring in, of the sons of Israel, even of the seed royal, and of the nobles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>youths in whom was no blemish, but comely of countenance, and skilful in all wisdom, and possessed of knowledge, and able to impart instruction, and who had vigour in them, to stand in the palace of the king,and that they should be taught the learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>And the king appointed them the provision of each day upon its day, out of the delicacies of the king and out of the wine which he drank, and so to let them grow three years,and, at the end thereof, that they should stand before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now there were, among them, out of the sons of Judah, Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>and the ruler of the eunuchs gave them names,yea he gave to Daniel the name of Belteshazzar, and to Hananiah of Shadrach, and to Mishael of Meshach, and to Azariah of Abed-nego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>But Daniel laid it upon his heart, that he would not defile himself with the delicacies of the king, nor with the wine which he drank,therefore sought he of the ruler of the eunuchs, that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>But, although God had brought Daniel into lovingkindness and tender compassion, before the ruler of the eunuchs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>yet said the ruler of the eunuchs unto Daniel, I do fear my lord the king, who hath appointed your food and your drink,for why should he see your faces more sad than those of the youths of your own age? so should ye bring me under the penalty of mine own head unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Then said Daniel, unto the overseer whom the ruler of the eunuchs had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>I pray theeprove thy servants, ten days,and let them give us vegetable food, that we may eat, and water that we may drink:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the countenances of the youths who have been eating the delicacies of the king,and, as thou shalt see, deal thou with thy servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So then he hearkened unto them, according to this word,and proved them ten-days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>and, at the end of ten days, their countenances appeared more comely, and fatter in flesh,than any of the youths who had been eating the delicacies of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>Thus it came about that the overseer continued taking away their delicacies, and the wine appointed them to drink,and kept on giving them vegetable food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>And, as for these four youths, God, gave them, knowledge and skill, in all learning and wisdom,and, Daniel, had discernment, in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>Now, at the end of the days after which the king had given word to bring them in, then did the ruler of the eunuchs bring them in, before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>So then the king, spake with them, and there was not found, from among them all, one like unto Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,therefore stood they before the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>and, in any matter of wisdom and discernment as to which the king, enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the sacred scribesthe magicians, who were in all his realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>Now Daniel continued, until the first year of Cyrus the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>And, in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams,and his spirit, was troubled, and, his sleep, had gone from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>So the king gave word to call for the sacred scribes and for the magicians, and for the users of incantations, and for the Chaldeans, that they might tell the king his dreams,they came in therefore, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>And the king, said to them, A dream, have I dreamed,and my spirit is troubled to know the dream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>Then spake the Chaldeans to the king, in Aramaic,O king, to the ages, live! Tell the dream to thy servants, and, the interpretation, we will declare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The word from me, is unalterable: If ye shall not make known to me the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and, your houses, into a dunghill, shall be turned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>but, if, the dream and the interpretation thereof, ye will declare, gifts and a present and great dignity, shall ye receive from before me,therefore, the dream and the interpretation thereof, declare ye unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered again and said,Let, the king, tell, the dream, to his servants, and, the interpretation thereof, we will declare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king answered and said, Of a certainty, I know, that, time, ye, would gain,merely because ye see that, unalterable, from me, is the word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>That, if, the dream, ye shall not make known to me, one and the same, is the decree, and, a lying and wicked word, have ye agreed to speak before me, that meanwhile the time may be changed,therefore, the dream, tell ye me, so shall I know that, the interpretation thereof, ye can declare for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered before the king and said, There is not a man upon the earth, who can declare, the matter of the king,although indeed, there is no king, chief ruler who, a thing like this, hath asked of any sacred scribe or magician or Chaldean;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>and, the thing which the king hath asked, is difficult, and, none other, is there, who can declare it before the king,saving the gods whose dwelling is, not with flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>For this cause, the king, was provoked and exceedingly indignant,and gave word to destroy all the wise men of Babylon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>and, the decree, went forth, that, the wise men, should be slain,and they sought Daniel and his companions that they might be slain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Immediately, Daniel, made answer with prudence and discretion, to Arioch, chief of the executioners of the king,who had come forth to slay the wise men of Babylon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>he began to speak and said to Arioch the kings captain,For what cause, is the decree raging forth from before the king? Then did Arioch make the matter known unto Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>So Daniel entered in, and desired of the king,that, an appointed time, he would give him, and then, the interpretation, he would declare unto the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel, to his own house, departed,and, to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions, made the matter known;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>that, tender compassion, they might seek from before the God of the heavens, concerning this secret,that Daniel and his companions, might not be destroyed, with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>Then, unto Danielin a vision of the night, the secret was revealed,whereupon, Daniel, blessed the God of the heavens:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel responded, and said, Let the name of God be blessed from age to age,in that wisdom and might, to him belong;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>And, he, changeth times and seasons, removeth kings, and setteth up kings,giving wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to them who are skilled in understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>He, revealeth the deep things, and the hidden,knoweth what is in the darkness, and, light, with him, doth dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>Unto the, O God of my fathers, do I render thanks and praise, in that, wisdom and might, thou hast given unto me,yea, already, hast thou made known to me that which we desired of thee, for, the matter of the king, hast thou made known unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore, Daniel entered in unto Arioch, whom the king had appointed to destroy the wise men of Babylon,he went in, and, thus, he said unto him, The wise men of Babylon, do not thou destroy, bring me in before the king, and, the interpretationunto the king, will I declare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Thereupon, Ariochwith haste, brought in Daniel before the king,and, thus, he said to himI have found a man of the sons of the exile of Judah, who, the interpretationunto the king, will make known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king answered and said unto Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar,Art thou able to make known unto me the dream which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered before the king, and said,The secret which the king hath asked, the wise men, the magicians, the sacred scribes, the astrologers, are not able to declare unto the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>but there is a God in the heavens, who revealeth secrets, and hath made known to King Nebuchadnezzar, what shall come to pass, in the afterpart of the days: Thy dream and the visions of thy head upon thy bed, are, these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>As for thee, O king, thy thoughts upon thy bed, arose regarding what should come to pass hereafter; and, he that revealeth secrets, made known to thee what shall come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>But, as for menot for any wisdom that is in me, more than any of the living, is, this secret, revealed to me,therefore, it is in order that, the interpretationunto the king, they should make known, and that, the thoughts of thy heart, thou shouldst get to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>As for thee, O king, thou wast looking, when lo! a great image, this image, being mighty, and the brightness thereof surpassing, was standing before thee,and, the appearance thereof, was terrible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>As for this image, its head, was of fine gold, its breast and its arms, were of silver,its belly and its thighs, of bronze;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>its legs, of iron,and, its feet, part of them, of iron, and, part of them, of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>Thou didst look, until that a stone tare itself away, not by the aid of hands, and smote the image upon its feet, which were of iron and clay,and they were broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>Then were broken in pieces at once, the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold, and became like chaff out of the summer threshing-floors, and the wind, carried them away, and, no place, was found for them,but, the stone that smote the image, became a mighty rock, and filled all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>This, is the dream, and, the interpretation thereof, we will tell before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>Thou, O king, art the king of kings,for, the God of the heavens, hath given unto thee, the kingship, the might, the power and the dignity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>and, wheresoever the sons of men do dwell, the wild beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens, hath he given into thy hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou, art the head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>And, after thee, shall arise another kingdom, inferior to thee,and anothera third kingdom, of bronze, which shall bear rule throughout all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>And, the fourth kingdom, shall be hard as iron,in like manner as iron breaketh in pieces and crusheth all things,even as iron which bringeth to ruins all these, shall it break in pieces and bring to ruins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>And, whereas thou sawest the feet and the toes, part of them of potters clay, and part of them of iron, the kingdom, shall be, divided, and, of the hardness of the iron, shall there be in it,forasmuch as thou sawest, the iron, combined with the miry clay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>and, the toes of the feet, part of them, iron, and, part, of clay,some part of the kingdom, shall be strong, but, a part thereof, shall be brittle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>and, whereas thou sawest, the iron, combined with the miry clay, they shall be combined with the seed of men, but shall not cleave firmly one to another,lo! as iron is not to be combined with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>And, in the days of those kings, shall the God of the heavens, set up, a kingdom which, to the ages, shall not be destroyed, and, the kingdom, to another people, shall not be left,it shall break in pieces and make an end of all these kingdoms, but, itself, shall stand to the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>Forasmuch as thou sawest that, out of the rock, a stone tare itself away, but not with hands, and brake in pieces the clay, the iron, the bronze, the silver and the gold, the mighty God, hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter. Exact then is the dream, and trusty its interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>Then, King Nebuchadnezzar, fell upon his face, and, unto Daniel, paid adoration; and, a present and sweet odours, gave he word to pour out unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king answered Daniel, and saidOf a truth, your God, is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a Revealer of secrets,seeing thou wast able to reveal this secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>Then, the king, exalted, Daniel, and, many large presents, gave he unto him, and set him to be ruler over all the province of Babylon,and chief of the nobles, over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>And, Daniel, desired of the king, and he appointedover the business of the province of BabylonShadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,but, Daniel himself, was in the gate of the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king, made an image of gold, the height thereof, sixty cubits, the breadth thereof, six cubits,he set it up in the valley of Dura, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>And, Nebuchadnezzar the king, sent to gather together the satraps, the nobles and the pashas, the chief judges, the treasurers, the judges, the lawyers, and all the rulers of the province,to come to the dedication of the image, which Nebuchadnezzar the king, had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>Then were gathered together, the satraps, the nobles and the pashas, the chief judges, the treasurers, the judges, the lawyers, and all the rulers of the province, to the dedication of the image, which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up,and they stood before the image, which Nebuchadnezzar, had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>And, the herald, proclaimed aloud,To you, is given the word, O ye peoples, races, and tongues:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>At what time ye shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the lyre, the harp, the psaltery, the bagpipes, and all kinds of instruments of music, ye shall fall down and adore the image of gold, which Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>and, whosoever shall not fall down and adore, shall, instantly, be cast into the burning furnace of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>Wherefore, at the same timewhen all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, the pipe, the lyre, the harp, the psaltery, and all kinds of instruments of music, they were falling downeven all the peoples, the races, and the tongues,adoring the image of gold, which Nebuchadnezzar the king, had set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Wherefore, at the same time, drew near certain Chaldeans,and accused the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>they spake, and said, to Nebuchadnezzar the king: O king! for ages, live!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>Thou thyself, O king, hast made a decree, that, any man who shall hear the sound of the horn, the pipe, the lyre, the harp, the psaltery and the bagpipes, and all kinds of instruments of music, shall fall down and adore the image of gold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>and, whosoever shall not fall down and adore, shall be cast into the burning furnace of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the business of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,these men, have made thee, O king, of no account, thy god, they serve not, and, the image of gold which thou hast set up, do they not adore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then, Nebuchadnezzarwith anger and wrath, gave word to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, then, these men, brought they before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it, with design, O Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,that, my god, ye are not serving, and, the image which I have set up, are not adoring?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>Now, if ye be ready, at what time ye shall hear the sound of the cornet, the pipe, the lyre, the harp, the psaltery and the bagpipes, and all the instruments of music, ye shall fall down and adore the image which I have made, but, if ye shall not adore, instantly, shall ye be cast into the midst of the burning furnace of fire,and who is the god that shall deliver you out of my hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego answered, and said to the king: O Nebuchadnezzar! we are not accounting it needful, concerning this, to answer thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>If it is, our God, whom we serve, is able to deliver us,out of the burning furnace of fire, and out of thy hand, O king, he will deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>But, if not, be it known to thee, O king,that, thy god, will we not serve, and, the image of gold which thou hast set up, will we not adore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Then, Nebuchadnezzar, was filled with wrath, and, the likeness of his countenance, was changed, against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,he spake and gave word to heat the furnace seven times hotter than it was ever seen heated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>and, to men, who were the mightiest men in his army, gave he word to bind fast Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego,to cast them into the burning furnace of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then bound they, these men, in their trousers, their tunics, and their cloaks, and their (other) clothing,and cast into the midst of the burning furnace of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Therefore, because the word of the king had raged forth, and the furnace was exceeding hot, those very men who took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, were slain by the flame of the fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>and, these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, fell down into the midst of the burning furnace of fire, fast bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Then, Nebuchadnezzar the king, was amazed, and rose up in haste: he spake and said to his nearest friendsWere there not three men, we cast into the midst of the fire, fast bound? They answered and said to the king, Surely, O king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He answered and said, Lo! I, see four men, unbound, walking in the midst of the fire, and, injury, there is not in them, and, the appearance of the fourth, is like to a son of the gods!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then did Nebuchadnezzar, draw near, to the door of the burning furnace of fire, he spake and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, ye servants of the most high God, step forth and come hither. Then stepped forth Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>Andbeing gathered togetherthe satraps, the nobles, and the pashas and near friends of the king, saw these men, over whose bodies the fire had, no power, nor was, a hair of their head, singed, neither were, their trousers, disfigured,nor had, the smell of fire, come upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, who hath sent his messenger, and delivered his servants, who trusted in him,when, the word of the king, they transgressed, and delivered up their bodies, that they might not serve nor adore any god, saving their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>Therefore do I make a decree, that, whosoever of any people, race, or tongue it be that shall charge any error upon the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, shall be cut in pieces, and, his house, into a dunghill, shall be changed; because there is no other God, who is able to deliver, like this!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>Then, the king, advanced Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, in the province of Babylon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all the peoples, the races and the tongues who are dwelling in all the earth, Let, your prosperity, abound!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>In the third year of the reign of Belshazzar the king, a vision, appeared unto me Daniel, after that which appeared unto me at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>So then I saw, in the vision, and it came to pass, when I saw, that I was in Shusan the fortress, which is in Persia the province,yea I saw it in a vision, when, I, was by the river Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>So then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and lo! a ram, standing before the river, and, it, had two horns,and, the two horns, were high, but, the one, was higher than the other, and, the higher, had come up, last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram, pushing strongly westward and northward and southward, so that no wild beast could stand before him, and none could deliver out of his hand,but he did according to his own pleasure, and shewed himself great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>Now, I, was observing, when lo! a he-goat, coming in out of the west, over the face of all the earth, but it meddled not with the earth,and, the goat, had a conspicuous horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>So then he came up to the ram having the two horns, which I had seen, standing before the river,and ran unto him, in the fury of his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>Yea I saw him coming close upon the ram, and he was enraged at him, and smote the ram, and brake in pieces both his horns, and there was no strength in the ram to stand before him,but he cast him down to the ground, and trampled him underfoot, and there was none could deliver the ram out of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>But, the he-goat, shewed himself very great,and, when he had become mighty, the great horn, was broken in pieces, and there came up afterwards four, in its stead, towards the four winds of the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>and, out of the first of them, came forth a little horn,which became exceedingly great, against the south and against the east, and against the beautiful   ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>yea it became great as far as the host of the heavens,and caused to fall, to the earth, some of the host and some of the stars, and trampled them underfoot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>even as far as the ruler of the host, shewed he his greatness,and, because of him, was taken away the continual   , and the place of the sanctuary, was cast down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>and, a host, was set over the continual   , by transgression,and faithfulness, was cast down, to the ground, and so he acted with effect, and succeeded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then heard I a certain holy one, speaking,and another holy one said to that certain holy one who was speakingHow long is the vision of the continual   as taken away, and the transgression which astoundeth, for both sanctuary and host to be given over to be trampled underfoot?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'>And he said unto him, Until two thousand and three hundred evening-mornings,then shall the sanctuary, be vindicated.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.8.17'>So he came near where I stood, and, when he came, I was terrified, and fell upon my face,but he said unto me, Understand, O son of man, that, to the time of the end, belongeth the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.18'>And, when he spake with me, I fell stunned upon my face, to the earth,but he touched me, and caused me to stand up where I was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.19'>Then said he, Behold me! causing thee to know, that which shall come to pass in the afterpart of the indignation,for, at an appointed time, shall be an end.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.8.23'>but, in the aftertime of their kingdom, when transgressions, have filled up their measure,there will stand up a king of mighty presence, and skilful in dissimulation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.24'>and his strength, will be mighty, but not through his own strength, and, wonderfully, will he destroy, and succeed and act with effect,and will destroy mighty ones, and the people of holy ones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.25'>and, by his cunning, will he both cause deceit to succeed in his hand, and, in his own heart, will he shew himself to be great, and, by their careless security, will he destroy many,and, against the ruler of rulers, will he stand up, but, without hand, shall be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.26'>Now, the revelation of the evening and the morning which hath been told, faithful, indeed it is,but, thou, close up the vision, because it is for many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.27'>Now, as for me Daniel, then was I sick for days, but I arose and did the business of the king,and, though I was confounded concerning the revelation, yet could no one discern it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.33'>And, they who make the people wise, will impart understanding to the many,yet shall they be brought low, by sword and by flame, by captivity and by prey, for some days;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.11.40'>And, in the time of the end, will the king of the south, push at him, and the king of the north, will rush against him, with chariots and with horsemen, and with many ships,and he will enter the lands, and overwhelm and pass over;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.11.41'>yea he will enter the beautiful land, and, many   , shall be laid low,but, these, shall be delivered out of his hand, Edom and Moab, and the first portion of the sons of Ammon;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.12.1'>And, at that time, will Michael, the great ruler who standeth for the sons of thy people, make a stand, and there will be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a nation, up to that time,and, at that time, shall thy people, be delivered, every one found written in the hook;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.2'>and, many of the sleepers in the dusty ground, shall awake,these,   to age-abiding life, but, those, to reproach, and age-abiding abhorrence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.3'>and, they who make wise, shall shine like the shining of the expanse,and, they who bring the many to righteousness, like the stars to times age-abiding and beyond.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.4'>But, thou, Daniel, close up the words, and seal the book, until the time of the end,many will run to and fro, and knowledge, shall abound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.5'>Then, I, Daniel, looked, and lo! two others, standing,one on this side of the bank of the river, and one on that side of the bank of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.12.6'>And one said to the man clothed with linen, who was upon the waters of the river, How long shall be the end of the wonders?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.12.12'>Happy! is he that waiteth, and attaineth to one thousand three hundred and thirty-five days.</verse>
