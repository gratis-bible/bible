        <title>Completed is thy punishment, O daughter of Zion, He will no more carry thee away captiveHe hath punished thine iniquity, O daughter of Edom, he hath stripped the veil from off thy sins.</title>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>And it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth mouth on the fifth day of the month I being in the midst of them of the captivity, by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>On the fifth of the month, that was the fifth year of the captivity of King Jehoiachin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>in very deed came the word of Yahweh unto Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar,yea the hand of Yahweh I came on him there I-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>So then I beheld and lo! a tempestuous wind coming out of the North, a great cloud and a fire catching hold of itself, and it had a brightness round about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>and out of the midst thereof, as burnished copper to look upon out of the midst of the fire; and out of the midst thereof, a likeness of four living ones, and this was their appearance, the likeness of a man, had they;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>and four faces each, and four wings each, had they;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>and their feet were straight feet,and the sole of their feet was like the sole of the foot of a calf, but sparkling, as shining bronze to look upon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>and the hands of a man! were under their wings, on their four sides,and their faces and their wings belonged to the four of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>joined to each other, were their wings,they turned not when they went, each one straight before him, did they go;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>and the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, with the face of a lion to the right of the four of them, and the face of an ox on the left, of the four of them,the face of an eagle, also had they four;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>and their wings were spread above, two of each joined one another, and two covered their bodies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>and each one straight before him, did they go,whithersoever the spirit was minded to go, they went, they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living ones, their appearance was like live coals of fire burning up like the appearance of torches, the same went to and fro between the living ones,and the fire had brightness and out of the fire, went forth a lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living ones ran and returned,like the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>And I looked at the living ones,and lo! one wheel upon the earth beside the living ones for each of his four faces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and of their structure was like a Tarshish-stone to look upon, and they four had one likeness,and their appearance and their structure were just as would be a wheel in the midst of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>Upon their four sides, when they went, so did they go,they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rings, they were so high that they were terrible, -and their rings full of eyes round about, had they four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living ones went, the wheels went beside them,and when the living ones were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>whithersoever the spirit was minded to go, they wentthither was the spirit minded to go,and the wheels would be lifted up along with them, for the spirit of the living one was in the wheels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>when they went, these went, and when they stood, there stood,ad when they were lifted up from off the earth, the wheels were lifted up along with them, for the spirit of the living one was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And there was a likeness over the heads of the living onean expanse, like terrible crystal to look upon, -stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the expanse, their wings were straight, one towards another,each one had two covering on this side, and each one had two covering on that side, their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And I heard the sound of their wings, as the sound of many waters, as the sound of the Almighty, when they went, the sound of a storm as the sound of a host,when they stood, they let down their wings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice above the expanse that was over their head,when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the expanse that was over their heads, as the appearance of a sapphire stone, was the likeness of a throne,and upon the likeness of a throne, was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as burnished copper to look upon, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upwards and from the appearance of his loins and downward, saw I as the appearance of fire, and he had brightness round about:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>as the appearance of the bow which is in a cloud on a day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about, that was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of Yahweh, and when I saw, I fell upon my face, and heard a voice of one speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said unto me,Son of man, Stand upon thy feet, that I may, speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>Then the Spirit entered into me as soon as he spoke unto me, and it caused me to stand upon my feet,and I heard one speaking unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said unto me- Son of man I am sending thee unto the sons of Israel, unto rebellious nations, which have rebelled against me,they, and their fathers have transgressed against me, until this very day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>and it is unto such sonsof shameless face, and emboldened heart, that I am sending thee,therefore shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith My Lord, Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they! whether they will hear or whether they will forbear, for a perverse house, they are, shall then know that la prophet hath been in their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>But thou son of man Be not afraid of them Nor of their words, be afraid Though thorns and thistles are about thee, And amongst prickly plants, thou dost dwell, Of their words, be not afraid nor At their faces, be thou dismayed, For a perverse house, they are!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>Thou shalt therefore speak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear For perverse, they are!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>Thou, therefore son of man, hear what I am speaking unto thee., become not perverse like the perverse house,open thy mouth, and eat that which I am giving unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>So I looked, and lo! a hand put forth unto me,and lo! therein a scroll;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>and he spread it out before me, and, it was written on the front and the back,and there were written thereon, lamentation and sighing, and wailing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>Then said he unto me, Son of man What thou findest, eat,-eat this roll, and go speak unto the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth,and he caused me to eat this roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>Then said he unto me Son of man. Thy belly, cause thou to eat and thy bowels, fl thou with this roll which I am giving unto thee. So I did eat, and it became in my mouth, as honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>Then said he unto me, Son of man Go get thee unto the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak with my words, unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For not unto a people deep of lip and heavy of tongue, art thou sent   unto the house of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>liner unto many peoples deep of lip and heavy of tongue, whose words thou couldst not understand,surely if unto them I had sent thee, they would have hearkened unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not be willing to hearken unto thee, for they are not willing to hearken unto me,for all the house of Israel are bold of forehead and hard of heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Lo! I have made thy face bold like as their faces, and thy forehead bold like as their forehead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint, have I made thy forehead,thou shalt not fear them neither shalt thou be dismayed at their faces, For a perverse house, they are!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Then said he unto me, Son of man. All my words which I shall speak unto thee, receive thou into thy heart and in thine ears, hear thou:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>then go get thee unto them of the captivity, unto the cons of thy people, and thou shalt speak unto them and say unto them, Thus saith My Lord Yahweh, whether they will hear or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the sound of a great rushing, Blessed be the glory of Yahweh. From his place!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>Yea the sound of the wings of the living ones, gently touching each other, and the sound of the wheels, along with them, even the sound of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away,and I went bitterly, in the rage of my spirit, but the hand of Yahweh upon me was strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Thus came I unto them of the captivity, at Tel-abib. who were dwelling towards he river Chebar and I dwelt where They were dwelling; yea I dwelt there seven days, stunned in their midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of Yahweh came unto me saying</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, A watchman, have I appointed thee to the house of Israel,and thou shalt hear, at my mouth a message, and shalt warn them from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say to the lawless man Thou shalt surely die, and thou hast not given him warning, neither hast spoken to warn the lawless man from his lawless way, to save him- self alive the same lawless man in his iniquity shall die, but his blood, tat thy hand will I require.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Whereas when thou hast warned a lawless man, and he hath not turned from his lawlessness and from his lawless way he in his iniquity shall die, but Thou hast delivered thine own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>And when a righteous man hath turned from his righteousness, and committed perversity, and I have suffered a stumbling- block to be laid before him he shall die, though thou hast not warned him, in his sin I shall he die, neither shall be remembered his righteous deeds which he hath done, but his blood, at thy hand will I require;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>whereas when Thou hast warned a righteous man. That a righteous man must not sin and he hath not sinned, he shall surely live in that he took warning, and thou hast delivered thine own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>Then came upon me there the hand of Yahweh,and he said unto me, Arise go forth into the valley, and there, will I speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>So I arose and went forth into the valley, and lo! there the glory of Yahweh, standing, like the glory which I saw by the river Chebar,-and I fell upon my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the Spirit entered into me, and caused me to stand upon my feet,and he spake with me and said unto me, Go in shut thyself up, in the midst of thine own house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>And thouO son of man, lo! they have put upon thee bands, and they will bind thee therewith,-.so that thou go not forth in their midst;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>thy tongue also, will I cause to cleave unto the roof of thy mouth, so shalt thou be dumb and not be to them a reprover, For a perverse house, they are!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say unto them. Thus saith My Lord Yahweh,He that is minded to hear, let him hear, And he that is minded to forbear, let him forbear! For a perverse house, they are!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>Thou therefore O son of man Take thee a tablet, and lay it before thee,and pourtray thereon a city, even Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>Then shalt thou lay siege against it And bud up against it a siege-wall And cast up against it, a mound, And set against it camps, And place against it battering-rams, round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>Thou, therefore take time a pan of iron, and set it for a wall of iron, between thee and the city,then shalt thou direct thy face against it and it shall come into siege and thou shalt lay siege to it, a sign, shall it be to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Thou, therefore lie thou on thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it, during the number of the days which thou shalt lie thereon, shalt thou bear their punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>I therefore have appointed thee the years of their punishment, by the number of days a hundred and ninety days,so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when thou hast ended these, then shalt thou lie, on thy right side. a second time, and shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah, forty days, one day for each year, have I appointed thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>Thus then unto the siege of Jerusalem, shalt thou direct thy face, with thine arm made bare,so shalt thou prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And lo! I have laid upon thee-bands,and thou shalt not turn thee from thy one side to thine other, until thou have ended the days of thy siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Thou, therefore, take thee wheat and barley and peas and lentils and millet and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make them ready for thee as bread,during the number of days which thou art lying on thy side. a hundred and ninety days, shalt thou eat it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>and thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight twenty shekels a day, from time to time, shalt thou eat it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>and water by measure, shalt thou drink the sixth part of a hin,-from time to time shalt thou drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>and as a barley cake, shalt thou eat it,and the same with dung proceeding from man, shalt thou bake, before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>Then said Yahweh, In like manner, shall the sons of Israel eat their bread defiled,among the nations whither I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then said, I, Ah! My Lord. Yahweh, lo! my person, hath not been defiled: neither of what hath died of itself nor of what hath been torn in pieces: have I eaten, from my youthful days even unto now, neither hath come into my mouth the flesh of a foul thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>So then he said unto me, See I have granted thee cows dung for mans dung,and thou shalt prepare thy bread thereupon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>And he said unto me, Son of man Behold me! breaking the staff of bread in Jerusalem, So shall they eat bread by weight and with anxious care, And water by measure, and in astonishment, shall they drink:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>that they may lack bread and water and be astonished one with another, and pine away in their punishment.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>Thou therefore son of man Take thee a sharp cuting instrument, a barbers razor, shalt thou take thee, and shalt cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy chin,and shalt take the balances for weighing, and shalt divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>A third part in the fire, shalt thou burn in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled,and thou shalt take a third part, thou shalt smite it with the cuting instrument round about it, and a third part, shalt thou scatter to the wind, and sword, will I, make bare after then;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>and thou shalt take from thence, a few in number,and shalt bind them in thy skirts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>and of them, again take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire,-therefrom, shall go forth a fire unto all the house of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>But she hath changed my regulations rote lawlessness, more than the nations, And my statutes more than the countries which are round bout her, For my regulations, have they rejected, And in my statutes, have they not walked. Therefore,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Thus saith My Lord, Yahweh. Because ye have become more rebellious than the nations who are round about you, In My statutes, have not walked. And my regulations, have not done, And according to the regulations of the nations which are round about you, have not done:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>Therefore, Thus, saith My Lord Yahweh, Lo! I am against thee, even I, Therefore will I, execute in thy midst, judgments, in the eyes of the nations;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>The third part of thee by pestilence, shall die, and by famine, be consumed in thy midst And the third part by the sword, shall fall round about thee,- And the third part to every wind, will I scatter, and a sword, will I make bare after them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>And it came to pass, in the sixth year in the sixth month, on the fifth of the month, I being seated in my house, and the elders of Judah being seated before me, then fell upon me there the hand of My Lord Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>So I looked, and lo! a likeness as the appearance of a man, from the appearance of his loins and downward fire, and from his loins and upwards as an appearance of shining, as the look of amber,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>Then put he forth the similitude of a hand, and took me by the forelock of my head,and the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heavens and brought me to Jerusalem in the visions of God into the opening of the inner gate that looketh toward the north, where was the seat of the Statue of Jealousy. that provoketh to jealousy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>and lo! there, the glory of the God of Israel, like the appearance which I had seen in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>Then said he unto me, Son of man Lift up. I pray thee thine eyes, the way toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes the way toward the north, and 1o! on the north by the gate of the altar, this Statue of Jealousy, in the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>Then said he unto me, Son of man Canst thou see what they are doing,the great abominations which the house of Israel are committing here, that I should go faraway from my sanctuary? Howbeit yet again, shalt thou see great abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>So he brought me into the opening of the court,and I looked, and lo! a single hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>Then said he unto m Son of man Break I pray thee through the wall. So I broke through the wall, and lo! a single opening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.9'>Then said he unto me, Go in, and see the wicked abominations. which they are committing here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>So I went in. and looked, and lo! every similitude of creeping thing, and detestable beast, and all the manufactured gods of the house of Israel,- pourtrayed upon the wall round about on every side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>and seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan, who stood in their midst were standing before them, even every man with his censer in his hand,and the fragrance of the cloud of incense ascending. le</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>Then said he unto me, Hast thou seen Son of man what the elders of the house of Israel, are doing in the dark, every man in his image-chambers? for they are saying Yahweh doth not see us! Yahweh hath forsaken the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.13'>Then said he unto me, Yet again, shalt thou see great abominations, which they are committing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.14'>So he brought me into the opening of the gate of the house of Yahweh, which was toward the north,and Lo! there, women sitting, weeping for Tammuz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.15'>Then said he unto me Hast thou seen O son of man? Yet again, shalt thou see greater abominations than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>So he brought me into the inner court of the house of Yahweh, and lo! at the opening of the temple of Yahweh, between the porch and the altar, about twenty-five men,their backs towards the temple of Yahweh and their faces eastward, and they were bowing down eastward unto the Sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>Then said he unto me Hast thou seen O son of man? Is it too small a thing for the house of Judah, to be committing the abominations which they have committed here,that they have fled the land with violence and have again provoked me to anger and there they are! putting the branch to my nose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>Therefore even I, will act with indignation, Mine eye shall not shield. Neither will I pity, Though they have cried in mine ears with a loud voice, yet will I not hear them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.1'>Then cried he in mine ears with a loud voice, saying, Draw near ye that have charge of the city,-even every man with his weapon of destruction in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.2'>And lo! six men coming in out of the way of the upper gate which looketh toward the north even every man with his destructive weapon in his hand, and one man in their midst clothed with linen, having a scribes ink holder by his side,so they came in and stood beside the altar of bronze.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>And the glory of the God of Israel lifted itself up from off the cherub whereon it had been, unto the threshold of the house,and he called unto the man clothed with linen, who had the scribes ink holder by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.4'>Then said Yahweh unto him. Pass along through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem,and set thou a mark upon the foreheads of the men who are sighing and crying over all the abominations that are being done in her midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>But unto these, said he in mine ears, Pass along through the city after him and smite,let not your eyes shield, neither have ye pity:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>elder, young man and virgin and little ones and women, shall ye slay utterly, but unto any man who hath upon him the mark, do not ye come near, and at my sanctuary, shall ye begin. So they began with the elder men. who were before the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>And he said unto them Defile ye the house and fl the courts with the slain,go ye forth! So they went forth and smote in the city. s</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>And it came to pass when they were smiting themI being left remaining, that I fell upon my face and made outcry, and said Alas! My Lord. Yahweh art thou about to destroy all the remnant of Israel, in that thou art pouring out of thine indignation upon Jerusalem?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>And he said unto me the iniquity of the house of Israel and Judah, is exceeding, great, and the land is filled with shed blood, and the city is full of over-reaching,for they have said. Yahweh hath forsaken the land, and Yahweh doth not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>Therefore as for even me, Mine eye shall not shield. Neither will I pity, Their way upon their own head, have I rendered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.11'>And lo! the man clothed in linen, having the ink-holder by his side, bringing back word saying, I have done according to all which thou didst command me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.1'>Then looked I. and lo! in the expanses which was over the head of the cherubim as a sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne, appeared over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.2'>Then said he unto the man clothed in linenthen said he Go in between the whirling wheels, even under the cherub, and fl both thy hands with live coals of fire from between the cherubim, and throw over the city. So he went in before mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.3'>Now the cherubim were standing on the right side of the house when the man went in,and, the, cloud filled the inner court,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.4'>Then arose the glory of Yahweh from off the cherub, unto the threshold of the house,and the house was fled with the cloud, and the, court, was fled with the brightness of the glory of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.5'>And the sound of the wings of the cherubim was heard, as far as the outer court,like the voice of the Almighty GOD when he speaketh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.6'>So then it came to pass when he commanded the man clothed with linen, saying, Take fire from between the whirling wheels, from between the cherubim, then went he in and stood beside the wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.7'>And the cherub put forth his hand from between the cherubim unto the fire that was between the cherubim, and took up thereof and gave into the hands of him who was clothed with linen,who took</verse>
