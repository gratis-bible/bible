      <chapter osisID='Deut.1'>
        <title>thou must not then make unclean the land wherein, ye, are dwelling, in the midst of which, I, have my habitation; for, I,Yahweh, am making my habitation in the midst of the sons of Israel.</title>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.1'>These, are the words, which Moses spake unto all Israel, over the Jordan,in the wilderness in the waste plain over against Suph, between Paran and Tophel, and Laban and Hazeroth and Di-zahab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.2'>eleven days from Horeb, by way of Mount Seir, as far as Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.3'>And it came to pass, in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first of the month, that Moses spake unto the sons of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given him in charge for them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.4'>after he had smitten Sihon, king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon,and Og, king of Bashan, who dwelt in Ashtaroth, in Edrei:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.5'>over the Jordan, in the land of Moab, did Moses take in hand to expound this law, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.6'>Yahweh our God, spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Long enough, have ye dwelt in this mountain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.7'>Turn ye and set yourselves forward, and enter into the hill country of the Amorites, and into all the places near, in the plain, in the mountain, and in the lowland, and in the south, and in the coast of the sea,the land of Canaan and the Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.8'>See! I have set before you the land,enter and possess the land, which, Yahweh sware unto your fathers to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give unto them, and unto their seed, after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.9'>So spake unto you, at that time saying, I am unable, by myself, to carry you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.10'>Yahweh your God hath multiplied you, and here ye are to-day, like the stars of the heavens for multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.11'>Yahweh, the God of your fathers, be adding unto you the like of you, a thousand times,and bless you, as he hath spoken unto you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.12'>How should I carry by myself the fatigue of you and the burden of you and your controversies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.13'>Set forth for youmen wise and discerning, and known to your tribes,that I may appoint them to be heads over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.14'>And ye answered me,and said, Good, is the word which thou hast spoken to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.15'>So I took heads for your tribes wise men and known, and placed them as heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties and captains of tens, and overseers for your tribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.16'>And I charged your judges, at that time, saying,Ye are to hear between your brethren and shall judge righteously, between each magi and his brother and his sojourner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.17'>Ye shall not take note of faces in judgmentso the small as the great, shall ye hear, ye shall not shrink from the face of any man, for judgment, unto God, belongeth,but the thing which is too hard for you, shall ye bring near unto me, and I will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.18'>So I commanded you at that time all the things which ye should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.19'>And when we brake up from Horeb, we came through all that great and terrible desert which ye saw, by way of the hill-country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us,and we entered in as far as Kadesh-barnea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.20'>Then said I unto you,Ye are come in as far as the hill-country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God, is giving unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.21'>See thouYahweh thy God hath set before thee the land,go uptake possession as Yahweh the God of thy fathers hath spoken unto thee, do not fear, neither be dismayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.22'>And ye came near unto me all of you, and said Let us send men before us, that they may search out for us the land,and bring us back word, the way by which we must go up, and the cities whereinto we must enter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.23'>And the thing, was good in mine eyes,so I took from among you twelve men, one man for each tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.24'>And they turned and went up the hill-country, and entered in as far as the ravine of Eshcol, and explored it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.25'>And they took in their hand of the fruit of the country, and bare it down unto us, and brought us back word, and said, Good is the land, which Yahweh our God, is giving unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.26'>Nevertheless ye were not willing to go up,but rebelled against the bidding of Yahweh, your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.27'>and murmured in your tents and said, Because Yahweh hated us, hath he brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.28'>Whither, are, we, to go up? Our own brethren, have made our heart melt sayingA people greater and taller than we, cities large and walled-up into the heavens,yea, moreover sons of Anakim, have we seen there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.29'>Then I said unto you,Ye must not tremble, nor be afraid of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.30'>Yahweh your God, who is going before you, he, will fight for you,according to all that he did with you in Egypt, before your eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.31'>also in the desert which thou hast seen, where Yahweh thy God carried thee as a man will carry his son, throughout all the way that ye journeyed, until ye entered as far as, this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.32'>But in this firing, ye were putting no trust in Yahweh your God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.33'>who was going before you in the wayto search out for you a place, where ye might encamp,in the fire by night, that ye might get sight of the way wherein ye should go, and in the cloud, by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.34'>And Yahweh heard the voice of your words,and was wroth and swaresaying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.35'>Surely, not one of these men, this wicked generation,shall see the good land, which I sware to give unto your fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.36'>saving Caleb son of Jephunneh, he, shall see it, and unto him, will I give the land through which he hath trodden, and unto his sons,because he hath wholly followed Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.37'>Even with me, did Yahweh show himself angry, for your sakes, saying,Even thou, shalt not enter therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.38'>Joshua son of Nun, who standeth before thee, he, shall enter in thither, him, strengthen thou, for he, shall cause Israel to inherit it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.39'>And your little ones, of whom ye said they should become, a prey, and your sons who to-day know not good and evil, they, shall enter in thither,and unto them, will I give it, and they, shall possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.40'>But as for you, turn ye, for your part,and set forward towards the desert, by way of the Red Sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.41'>Then responded ye and said unto meWe have sinned against Yahweh, We, ourselves, will go up, and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God hath commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war, ye foolishly went up towards the hill-country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.42'>Then said Yahweh unto meSay unto them Ye shall not go up, nor fight, for I am not in your midst,lest ye should be smitten before your enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.43'>So I spake unto you howbeit ye hearkened not,but rebelled against the bidding of Yahweh, and presumptuously went up the hill-country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.44'>Then came forth the Amorites who were dwelling in that country, to meet you, and they chased you, as do, bees; and struck you down in Seir, as far as Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.45'>So then ye returned and wept before Yahweh,but Yahweh hearkened not unto your voice, nor gave ear unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.1.46'>And ye abode in Kadesh many days,how many were the days that ye abode</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.2'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.1'>Then turned we, and set forward towards the desert by way of the Red Sea, as Yahweh, spake unto me; and we encompassed Mount Seir many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.2'>And Yahweh spake unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.3'>Long enough, have ye encompassed this mountain,turn yourselves north, wards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.4'>And, the people, command thou saying, Ye are about to pass through the boundary of your brethren the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir,and should they he afraid of you, take ye good heed to yourselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.5'>do not engage in strife with them, for I will not give you of their land, so much as place for the tread of a foot-sole,for as a possession to Esau, have I given Mount Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.6'>Food, shall ye buy of them with silver so shall ye eat,yea even water, shall ye buy of them with silver so shall ye drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.7'>For Yahweh thy God, hath blessed thee in all the work of thy hand, he hath considered thy traversing of this great desert,these forty years, hath Yahweh thy God been with thee, thou hast lacked, nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.8'>So we passed on, a way from our brethren the sons of Esau who dwell in Seir, from the way of the waste plain, from Elath, and from Ezion-geber,and we turned and passed on by way of the desert of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.9'>And Yahweh said unto meDo not lay siege to Moab, nor engage in strife with them in battle,for I will not give unto thee of his and as a possession, for unto the sons of Lot, have I given Ar, as a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.10'>the Emim, formerly dwelt therein,a people great and many and tall, like the Anakim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.11'>Giants, used, they also, to be accounted like the Anakim,but the Moabites, called them Emim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.12'>And in Seir, dwelt the Horim aforetime, but, the sons of Esau, dispossessed them, and destroyed them from before them, and dwelt in their stead,as did Israel unto the land of his own possession, which Yahweh had given unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.13'>Now, arise, and pass ye over the ravine of Zered. So we passed over the ravine of Zered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.14'>Now, the days in which we journeyed from Kadesh-barnea, as far as where we crossed the ravine of Zered, were thirty-eight years,until all the generation of the men of war were consumed out of the midst of the camp, as Yahweh had sworn unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.15'>Yea, even the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them out of the midst of the camp,until they were consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.16'>So it came to pass when all the men of war were consumed by dying, out of the midst of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.17'>then spake Yahweh unto me, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.18'>Thou, art passing, to-day, the boundary of Moab even Ar;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.19'>so wilt thou draw near over against the sons of Ammon, do not thou besiege them neither engage in strife with them,for I will not give of the land of the sons of Ammon unto thee as a possession, for unto the sons of Lot, have I given it as a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.20'>A land of giants, used, that also, to be accounted,giants, dwelt therein aforetime, but the Ammonites, called them Zamzummim:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.21'>a people great and many and tall, like the Anakim,but Yahweh destroyed them from before them, and they took their possessions, and dwelt in their stead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.22'>as he did for the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir,when he destroyed the Horim from before them, and they took their possessions and have dwelt in their stead, even unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.23'>The Avvim also, who dwelt in settlements as far as Gaza, Caphtorim, who were coming forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.24'>Arise ye, set forward and cross over the ravine of Arnon, see! I have given into thy handSihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite and his land, begintake possession,and engage in strife with him in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.25'>This day, will I begin to extend the dread of thee and the fear of thee over the face of the peoples under all the heavens,who will hear the report of thee, then will they quake and writhe in pain because of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.26'>So I sent messengers out of the desert of Kademoth, unto Sihon, king of Heshbon,with words of peace saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.27'>I would pass along through thy land, by the road, by the road, will I go,I will not turn aside, to the right hand or to the left:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.28'>Food for silver, shalt thou sell me so will I eat, and water for silver, shalt thou let me have, so will I drink,only I would pass through on my feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.29'>as the sons of Esau, who are dwelling in Seir, did to me, and the Moabites who are dwelling in Ar,until that I pass over the Jordan, into the land which, Yahweh our God, is giving unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.30'>But Sihon king of Heshbon, was not willing, to let us pass along through it,for Yahweh thy God had suffered him to make his spirit harsh and his heart bold, that he might give him into thy hand(as   this day).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.31'>Then said Yahweh unto me, See! I have begun to deliver up before thee Sihon and his land,begin take possession, that thou mayest make a possession of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.32'>So then Sihon came out to meet us he, and all his people, to give battle at Jahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.33'>And Yahweh our God delivered him up before us,and we smote him and his sons, and all his people</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.34'>And we captured all his cities, at that time, and devoted to destruction every city of males, with the women and the little ones,we left not remaining a survivor:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.35'>only the cattle, made we our prey,and the spoil of the cities which we captured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.36'>From Aroer, which is on the edge of the ravine of Arnon and the city that is in the ravine even as far as Gilead, there was not a fortress that proved too high for us,the whole, did Yahweh our God deliver up before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.2.37'>Only unto the land of the sons of Ammon, didst thou not come near,all the side of the Jabbok ravine, nor the cities of the hill country, nor any which Yahweh our God had forbidden to us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.3'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.1'>Then turned we and went up, the way of Bashan; and Og king of Bashan, came out to meet us, he, and all his people, to give battle at Edrei.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.2'>And Yahweh said unto me: Do not fear him, for into thy hand, have I delivered him and all his people and his land,so then thou shalt do unto him, as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites who was dwelling in Heshbon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.3'>Then did Yahweh our God deliver into our hand, Og also, king of Bashan and all his people,so we smote him until there was not left remaining to him a survivor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.4'>And we captured all his cities, at that time, there was no fortress which we took not from them,sixty cities all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.5'>All these, were fortified cities each with a high wall, folding gates and a bar,besides country towns exceeding many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.6'>And we devoted them to destruction, doing unto them as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon,devoting to destruction every city of males, the women, and the little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.7'>But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, made we our prey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.8'>Thus did we at that time take the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites (which was over the Jordan),from the ravine of Arnon as far as Mount Hermon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.9'>Sidonians, call Hermon Sirion,but, the Amorites, call it Senir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.10'>All the cities of the table-land, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,unto Salecah, and Edrei,cities of the kingdom of Og, in Bashan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.11'>For, only Og, king of Bashan was left remaining of the remnant of the giants, lo! his bedstead, was a bedstead of iron, is not, the same, in Rabbath of the sons of Ammon? nine cubits, the length thereof and four cubits, the breadth thereof, by the fore-arm of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.12'>And this land, took we in possession at that time,from Aroer which is by the ravine of Arnon, and half the hill-country of Gilead and the cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.13'>but the remainder of Gilead, and all Bashan the kingdom of Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh,all the region of the Argob with all Bashan. The same, is called, A land of giants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.14'>Jair, son of Manasseh, took all the region of Argob, as far as the boundary of the Geshurites, and the Maachathites,and called them after his own name The Bashan of Havvoth-jair unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.15'>And, unto Machir, gave I Gilead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.16'>And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites, gave Ifrom Gilead even as far as the ravine of Arnon, the middle of the ravine and boundary,even as far as the Jabbok ravine, the boundary of the sons</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.17'>Ammon; the Waste Plain also and the Jordan and boundary,from Chinnereth, even as far as the sea of the Waste Plain the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah, on the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.18'>So I commanded you, at that time saying,Yahweh your God hath given unto you this land to possess it, armed, shall ye pass over before your brethren the sons of Israel all the sons of valour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.19'>Only, your wives and your little ones and your cattleI know that ye have much cattleshall abide in your cities which I have given unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.20'>until that Yahweh shall give rest unto your brethren, as well as you, so shall, they too, possess the land which, Yahweh your God, is giving unto them, over the Jordan,then shall ye return every man unto his possession, which I have given unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.21'>Jeshua also, commanded I, at that time saying,Thine are the eyes, that have seen all that Yahweh your God hath done unto these two kings, thus, will Yahweh do unto all the kingdoms whereunto thou, art passing over:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.22'>ye shall not fear them,for, Yahweh your God, he, it is that is fighting for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.23'>Then sought I Yahweh at that time, for a favour saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.24'>My Lord Yahweh, thou thyself, hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness, and thy firm hand,as to which, what GOD is there, in the heavens or in the earth, that can do according to thy doings, and according to thy mighty deeds?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.25'>Let me pass over, I pray thee that I may see the good land that is over the Jordan,this good mountain, and the Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.26'>But Yahweh had been provoked with me for your sakes, and hearkened not unto me,and Yahweh said unto me, Enough for thee! do not add a word unto me further in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.27'>Ascend the top of the Pisgah, and lift up thine eyeswestward, and northward and southward and eastwardand see with thine own eyes,for thou shalt not pass over this Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.28'>But command thou Joshua and confirm him and embolden him,for, he, shall pass over before this people, and, he shall cause them to inherit the land which thou shalt see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.3.29'>So we abode in the valley, over against Beth-peor.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Deut.4'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.4.1'>Now, therefore, O Israel, hearken thou unto the statutes, and unto the regulations, which, I, am teaching you, to do   ,to the end ye may live and enter and possess the land, which, Yahweh, the God of your fathers, is giving unto you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.9'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.1'>Hear O Israel! thou art passing, to-day, over the Jordan, to go in to dispossess nations, greater and stronger than thou,cities great and fortified into the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.2'>a people great and tall, the sons of Anakim,whom, thou, knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand before the sons of Anak?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.3'>So then, thou must consider to-day, that Yahweh thy God, he it is that is passing over before thee as a consuming fire, he, will destroy them, and, he, will cause them to bow down before thee,so shalt thou dispossess them, and destroy them speedily, as Yahweh hath spoken unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.4'>Do not speak in thy heart, when Yahweh thy God casteth them out from before thee saying, For mine own righteousness, hath Yahweh brought me in, to possess this land,whereas it is for the lawlessness of these nations, that, Yahweh, is dispossessing them from before thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.5'>Not for thine own righteousness, nor for the uprightness of thine own heart, art thou going in to possess their land,but or the lawlessness of these nations, is, Yahweh thy God driving them out from before thee, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh sware unto thy fathers, unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.6'>So then, thou must consider that, not for thine own righteousness, is Yahweh thy God giving unto thee this good land to possess it,for a stiff-necked people, thou art.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.7'>Rememberdo not forget, how thou didst provoke Yahweh thy God, in the desert,yea from the day when thou earnest forth out of the and of Egypt until ye entered as far as this place, have ye been quarrelling, with Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.8'>Even in Horeb, ye provoked Yahweh to wrath,so that Yahweh showed himself angry with you to destroy you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.9'>When I went up into the mountain to receive the tables of stonethe tables of the covenant, which Yahweh had solemnised with you, then abode I in the mountain forty days and forty nights, food, did I not, eat, and water, did I not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.10'>Then did Yahweh deliver unto me the two tables of stone, written with the finger of God,and   upon them, according to all the words which Yahweh had spoken with you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the convocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.11'>So then it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave unto me the two tables of stone the tables of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.12'>Then said Yahweh unto meUp! get down quickly out of this mountain, for thy people whom thou hast brought forth out of Egypt, have broken faith,they have turned aside quickly, out of the way which I commanded them,they have made them a molten image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.13'>And Yahweh spake unto me saying,I have looked on this people, and lo! a stiff-necked people, it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.14'>Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and wipe out their name from under the heavens,and make thee into a nation stronger and more in number than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.15'>So I turned, and came down out of the mountain, now the mountain was burning with fire,and the two tables of the covenant were upon my two hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.16'>Then looked I, and lo! ye had sinned against Yahweh your God, ye had made you a molten calf,ye had turned aside quickly, out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.17'>So I seized the two tables, and cast them from off my two hands,and brake them in pieces before your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.18'>Then lay I prostrate before Yahweh as at the first, forty days and forty nights, food, did I not eat, and water, did I not drink,because of all your sin which ye had sinned, in doing the thing that was wicked, in the eyes of Yahweh. to provoke him to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.19'>For I shrank with fear from the face of the anger and the hot displeasure, wherewith Yahweh was provoked against you to destroy you,but Yahweh hearkened unto me, even at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.20'>And with Aaron, did Yahweh show himself exceedingly angry, to destroy him,so I prostrated myself, even in behalf of Aaron at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.21'>And your sin which ye had made even the calf, took I and burned it up with fire, and pounded it very small, until it was fine as dust,then cast I the dust thereof into the torrent that descended out of the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.22'>Also, at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hataavah, a cause of provocation, became ye unto Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.23'>Also when Yahweh sent you out of Kadesh-barnea saying, Go up and possess the land which I have given unto you then quarreled ye with the bidding of Yahweh your God, and trusted him not, neither hearkened unto his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.24'>Ye have been quarrelling, with Yahweh,from the day that I first knew you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.25'>Thus, then lay I prostrate before Yahweh, the forty days and the forty nights that I did lie prostrate,because Yahweh spake of destroying you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.26'>Therefore I prostrated myself unto Yahweh and said, My Lord Yahweh! Do not destroy thy people even thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness,which thou hast brought forth out of Egypt with a firm hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.27'>Have remembrance of thy servants, of Abraham, of Isaac and of Jacob,do not regard the obduracy of this people, or their lawlessness or their sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.28'>lest the land out of which thou hast brought us forth say, Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land of which he had spoken to them,and because he hated them, took he them forth to put them to death in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.9.29'>Yet, they, are thy people and thine inheritance,whom thou hast brought forth with thy great strength, and with thy stretched-out arm.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Deut.10'>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.1'>At that time, said Yahweh unto meCut thee out two tables of stone like the first, and come up unto me into the mountain,and make thee an ark of wood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.2'>that I may write, upon the tables, the words which were on the first tables which thou brakest in pieces,then shalt thou put them in the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.3'>So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut out two tables of stone like the first,and went up the mountain, having the two tables in my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.4'>And he wrote upon the tables according to the first writingthe ten words, which Yahweh had spoken unto you in the mountain, out of the midst of the fire in the day of the convocation,and Yahweh delivered them unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.5'>Then turned I, and came down out of the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made,and they have remained there, as Yahweh commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.6'>And, the sons of Israel, set forward out of Beeroth Bene-jaakan to Moserah,there, died Aaron and was buried there, and Eleazar his son became priest in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.7'>From thence, set they forward unto the Gudgodah,and from the Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of torrents of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.8'>At that time, did Yahweh separate the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh,to stand before Yahweh to wait upon him and to bless in his name (until this day).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.9'>For this cause, hath Levi neither portion nor inheritance with his brethren,Yahweh, is his inheritance, as Yahweh thy God spake unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.10'>But, I, stayed in the mountain according to the former days, forty days and forty nights,and Yahweh hearkened unto me at that time also, Yahweh was not willing a to destroy thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.11'>So then Yahweh said unto me, Up with theeto break away onward, before the people,that they may enter in and possess the land, which I sware unto their fathers, to give unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.10.12'>Now, therefore, O Israel, what is, Yahweh thy God, asking of thee,but to revere Yahweh thy God to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Yahweh thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Deut.32.15'>Then Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: Thou wast fat, Thou wast thick, Thou wast gorged, So he forsook the GOD who made him, And treated as foolish his Rock of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Deut.32.16'>They moved him to jealousy with foreign   ,With abominations, angered they him:</verse>
