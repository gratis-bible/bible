        <title>And, returning, they made ready spices and perfumes. And, on the Sabbath, indeed, they were quiet, according to the commandment;</title>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>Originally, was, the Word, and, the Word, was, with God; and, the Word, was, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same, was originally, with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things, through him, came into existence, and, without him, came into existence, not even one thing: that which hath come into existence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>in him, was, life, and, the life, was, the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And, the light, in the darkness, shineth; and, the darkness, thereof, laid not hold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There arose a man, sent from God, whose name was, John:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>The same, came, for a witness, That he might bear witness, concerning the light, that, all, might believe, through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He, was not the light,but, that he might bear witness concerning the light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>It, wasThe real light that enlighteneth every manComing into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>In the world, he was, and, the world, through him, came into existence, and, the world, knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>Into his own possessions, he came, and, his own people, received him not home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But, as many as did receive him, he gave, unto them, authority, children of God, to become,unto them who were believing on his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>Whonot of bloods, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, butof God, were born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And, the Word, became, flesh, and pitched his tent among us, and we gazed upon his glory,a glory, as an Only-begotten from his Father. Full of favour and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>(John beareth witness concerning him, and hath cried aloud, sayingthe same, was he that saidHe who, after me, was coming, before me, hath advanced; because, my Chief, was he.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>Because, out of his fulness, we all, received, even favour over against favour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>Because, the law, through Moses, was given, favour and truth, through Jesus Christ, came into existence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one, hath seen, God, at any time: An Only Begotten God, The One existing within the bosom of the Father, He, hath interpreted</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And, this, is the witness of John, when the Jews sent forth unto him, out of Jerusalem, priests and Levites,that they might question himWho art, thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>and he confessed, and did not deny,and he confessedI, am not, the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>and they questioned himWhat then? Art, thou, Elijah? and he saithI am not; The prophet, art, thou? and he answeredNo!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>So they said unto himWho, art thou? that, an answer, we may give, unto them who sent us,What sayest thou, concerning thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He saidI, am a Voice, of one crying aloud;In the desert, make ye straight, the way of the Lord: according as said Isaiah the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they had been sent forth from among the Pharisees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>and they questioned him, and said unto himWhy, then, dost thou immerse,if, thou, art not, the Christ, nor Elijah, nor, the Prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, sayingI, immerse, in water. In the midst of you, standeth one, whom, ye, know not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>after me, coming:Of whom, I, am not worthy that I should unloose the thong of the sandal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things, in Bethany, came to pass, beyond the Jordan, where John was, immersing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the morrow, he beholdeth Jesus, coming unto him, and saithSee! the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This, is he, of whom, I, saidAfter me, cometh a man, who, before me, hath advanced, because, my Chief, was he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And, I, knew him not, but, that he might be manifested unto Israel, therefore, came, I, in water, immersing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bare witness, sayingI have gazed upon the Spirit, descending like a dove, out of heaven,and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And, I, knew him not,but, he that sent me to immerse in water, he, unto me, saidUpon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending and abiding upon him, the same, is he that immerseth in Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>I, therefore, have seen, and borne witnessThat, this, is, the, Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>On the morrow, again, was John standing, and, from among his disciples, two;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and, looking at Jesus walking, he saithSee! the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>and the two disciples hearkened unto him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>But Jesus, turning, and looking at them following, saith unto themWhat seek ye? And, they, said unto himRabbi! which meaneth, when translated, Teacher, Where abidest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith unto themBe coming, and ye shall see. They came, therefore, and saw where he abode, and, with him, they abode that day. It was about the tenth, hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two that heard from John and followed him, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>The same findeth, first, his own brother Simon, and saith unto himWe have found the Messiah! which is, when translated, Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He led him unto Jesus. Jesus, looking at him, saidThou, art Simon, the son of John,thou, shalt be called, Cephas; which is to be translated, Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the morrow, he desired to go forth into Galilee. And Jesus findeth Philip, and saith unto himBe following me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip, findeth, Nathanael, and saith unto himHim, of whom wrote Moses in the law, and the Prophets, have we found.Jesus, son of Joseph, him from Nazareth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said unto himOut of Nazareth, can any good thing come? Philip saith unto himCome, and see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him, and saith concerning himSee! Truly, an Israelite, in whom is no guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael saith unto himWhence, dost thou, know, me? Jesus answered, and said unto himBefore Philip called thee,when thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered himRabbi! thou, art, the Son of God: Thou, art, King, of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered, and said unto himBecause I said unto thee, I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? A greater thing than these, shalt thou see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he saith unto himVerily, verily, I say unto you: Ye shall see heavenwhen set open, and, the messengers of God, ascending and descending unto the Son of Man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And, on the third day, a marriage, took place, in Cana, of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and Jesus also was invited, with his disciples, unto the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And, wine falling short, the mother of Jesus saith unto himWine, have they none!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>And Jesus saith unto herWhat part can I take with thee, O woman? Not yet, hath come, mine hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother saith unto them who are ministeringWhatsoever he may say to you, do!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were there, six stone water-vessels, placed, according to the purification of the Jews; holding each, two or three measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus saith unto themFill the vessels with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he saith unto themDraw out now, and be bearing unto the master of the feast. And they bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And, when the master of the feast had tasted the water, now made, wine, and knew not whence it was,though, they who were ministering, knew, even they who had drawn out the water, the master accosteth the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and saith unto himEvery man, first the good wine, setteth out; and, when they had been well-supplied, the inferior:Thou, hast kept the good wine until, even now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This, beginning of his signs, did Jesus, in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this, he came down into Capernaum,he, and his mother and brethren, and his disciples; and, there, they abode, not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And, near, was the passover of the Jews; and, Jesus, went up unto Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found, in the temple, them that were selling oxen and sheep and doves, also the money-changers sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And, making a scourge out of rushes, all of them, thrust he forth out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and, the money-changers small coins, poured he forth, and, the tables, he overturned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and unto them who were selling, the doves, he saidTake these things hence! Be not making, the house of my Father, a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it was writtenThe zeal of thy house, eateth me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jews therefore answered, and said unto him, What sign, dost thou point out to us, in that, these things, thou doest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered, and said unto themTake down this shrine, and, in three days, will I raise it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews, therefore, saidIn forty and six years, was this shrine built. And, thou, in three days, wilt raise it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But, he, was speaking concerning the shrine of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When, therefore, he had been raised from among the dead, his disciples remembered, that, this, he had been saying; and they believed in the Scripture, and in the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now, when he was in Jerusalem, during the passover, during the feast, many, believed on his name, viewing his signs which he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>Jesus himself, however, was not trusting himself unto them, by reason of his understanding them all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and because he had, no need, that anyone should bear witness concerning man; for, he, understood what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>There was however, a man from among the Pharisees, Nicodemus, his name,ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>The same, came unto him, by night, and said unto himRabbi! we know that, from God, thou hast come, a teacher; for, no one, can be doing, these signs, which, thou, art doing, except, God, be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered, and said unto himVerily, verily, I say unto thee: Except one be born from above, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus saith unto himHow, can a man be born, when he is, old? Can he, into the womb of his mother, a second time, enter, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answeredVerily, verily, I say unto thee: Except one be born of water and spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which hath been born of the flesh, is, flesh, and, that which hath been born of the spirit, is, spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not marvel, that I said unto thee: Ye must needs be born from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The spirit, where it pleaseth, doth breathe, and, the sound thereof, thou hearest; but knowest not, whence it cometh and whither it goeth: Thus, is every one who hath been born of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered, and said unto himHow, can these things, come about?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered, and said unto himArt, thou, the teacher of Israel, and, these things, knowest not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Verily, verily, I say unto thee: What we know, we speak, and, of what we have seen, we bear witness, and, our witness, ye receive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If, the earthly things, I told you, and ye believe not, How, if I should tell you the heavenly things, will ye believe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And, no one, hath ascended into heaven, save he that, out of heaven, descended,The Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And, just as, Moses, lifted up the serpent in the desert, so, must, the Son of Man, be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>That, whosoever believeth in him, may have life age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God, so loved, the world, that, his Only Begotten Son, he gave,that, whosoever believeth on him, might not perish, but have life age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God, sent not, his Son into the world, that he might judge the world, but, that the world might be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believeth on him, is not to be judged: he that believeth not, already, hath been judged,because he hath not believed on the name of the Only Begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And, this, is the judgment: That, the light, hath come into the world,and men loved, rather the darkness than the light, for, wicked, were their, works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For, whosoever doth practise corrupt things, hateth the light, and cometh not unto the light, lest his works should be reproved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But, he that doeth the truth, cometh unto the light, that his works may be, made manifest, that, in God, have they been wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things, came Jesus, and his disciples, into the Judaean land; and, there, was he tarrying with them, and immersing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was immersing in Aenon, near to him, because, many waters, were there; and they were coming, and being immersed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>for, not yet, had John been cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>There arose, therefore, a questioning, from among the disciples of John, with a Jew,concerning purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came unto John, and said unto himRabbi! he who was with thee beyond the Jordan, unto whom, thou, hast borne witness, see! the same, is immersing; and, all, are coming unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, and saidA man can receive, nothing, except it have been given him out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>Ye yourselves, unto me, bear witness, that, I, saidI, am not the Christ; butI am sent before, That One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that hath the bride, is, bridegroom; but, the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth by and hearkeneth unto him, greatly, rejoiceth, by reason of the voice of the bridegroom. This, my joy, therefore, is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>That One, it behoveth to increase,but, me, to decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He that, from above, doth come, over all, is: he that is of the earth, of the earth, is, and, of the earth, doth speak: he that, out of heaven, doth come, over all, is,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What he hath seen and heard, of, the same, he beareth witness,and, his witness, no one, receiveth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He that hath received his witness, hath set sealthat, God, is, true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For, he whom God hath sent, the sayings of God, doth speak; for, not by measure, giveth he the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father, loveth the Son, and, all things, hath given into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He that believeth on the Son, hath life age-abiding: whereas, he that yieldeth not unto the Son, shall not see life,but, the anger of God, awaiteth him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew, that the Pharisees had heardJesus, more disciples, is making and immersing, than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>although indeed, Jesus himself, was not immersing, but his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judaea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>Now he must needs pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>He cometh, therefore, unto a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near the parcel of ground which Jacob gave unto Joseph his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacobs fountain was there. Jesus, therefore, having become toil-worn with the journey, was sitting thus, upon the fountain. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus saith unto herGive me to drink!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>for, his disciples, had gone away into the city, that, food, they might buy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The Samaritan woman, therefore, saith unto himHow dost, thou, being, a Jew, ask to drink, of me, who am, a Samaritan woman?  for, Jews, have no dealings with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered, and said unto herIf thou hadst known the free gift of God, and who it is that is saying unto thee, Give me to drink, thou, wouldst have asked him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>She saith unto himSir! not even a bucket, hast thou,and, the well, is, deep:Whence, then, hast thou the living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art, thou, greater than, our father Jacob, who gave us the well,and, himself, out of it drank, and his sons, and his flocks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered, and said unto herWhosoever drinketh of this water, will thirst, again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>But, whosoever shall drink of the water which, I, will give him, in nowise shall thirst, unto times age-abiding,but, the water which I will give him, shall become, within him, a fountain of water, springing up unto life age-abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman saith unto himSir! give me this water, that I thirst not, neither be coming hither to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>He saith unto herGo, call thy husband, and come hither!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered, and said  unto him I have no husband. Jesus saith unto herWell, saidst thou, A husband, I have not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for, five husbands, thou hast had,and, now, he whom thou hast, is not thy, husband: This true thing, hast thou spoken.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>And, after these things, Jesus was walking in Galilee; for he was not wishing, in Judaea, to be walking, because the Jews were seeking to slay him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>But the feast of the Jews was near, that of the pitching of tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brethren, therefore, said unto himRemove hence, and withdraw into Judaea, that, thy disciples also, may view thy works which thou art doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For, no one, anything in secret, doeth, and yet is seeking, himself, to be well-known. If, these things, thou art doing, manifest thyself unto the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus, therefore, saith unto themMy season, not yet, is here; but, your season, at anytime, is ready:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you; but, me, it hateth, because, I, bear witness concerning it, that, the works thereof, are, wicked.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>No one, nevertheless, was speaking, openly, about him, because of their fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>Presently, however, the feast being at its height, Jesus went up unto the temple and was teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>The Jews, therefore, began to marvel, sayingHow, doth this one know, letters, not having learned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus, therefore, answered them, and saidMy teaching, is not mine, but his who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any one intend, his will, to do, he shall get to know concerning the teachingwhether it is, of God, or, I, from myself, am speaking,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees hearkened unto the multitude murmuring concerning him these things; and the High-priests and the Pharisees sent forth officers, that they might seize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Jesus, therefore, saidYet a little time, I am, with you, and withdraw unto him that sent me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>Ye shall seek me, and not find me, and, where, I, am, ye, cannot come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews, therefore, said unto themselvesWhither, is, this one, about to go, that we shall not find him? Unto the dispersion of the Greeks, is he about to go, and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What, is this which he said: Ye shall seek me and not find me, and, where, I, am, ye, cannot come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>Now, on the lastthe greatday of the feast, Jesus was standing, and he cried aloud, sayingIf any man thirst, let him come unto me and drink:</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>Now, this, spake he concerning the Spirit which they who believed on him were about to receive; for, not yet, was there Spirit, because, Jesus, not yet, was glorified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Some from amongst the multitude, therefore, having hearkened unto these words, were sayingThis, is, in truth, the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others, were sayingThis, is, the Christ. But, others, were sayingOut of Galilee, is, the Christ, to come?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>Certain, indeed, from among them, were wishing to seize him; but, no one, thrust upon him his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>So then the officers came unto the High-priests and Pharisees, and, they, said unto themFor what cause, have ye not brought him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answeredNever, man spake thus!</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>Verily, verily, I say unto you:He that entereth not, through the door, into the fold of the sheep, but goeth up from another place, that man, is, a thief, and, a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.2'>But, he that entereth through the door, is, shepherd, of the sheep:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'>To him, the porter openeth, and, the sheep, unto his voice, hearken: and, his own sheep, he calleth by name, and leadeth them forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.4'>As soon as, all his own, he hath put forth, before them, he moveth on, and, the sheep, follow him, because they know his voice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.5'>But, a stranger, will they in nowise follow, but will flee from him, because they know not the voice, of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.6'>This similitude, spake Jesus unto them; but, those men, understood not what the things were which he was speaking unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>Jesus, therefore, said, againVerily, verily, I say unto you:I, am the door of the sheep:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.8'>All, as many as came before me, are thieves, and, robbers: but the sheep hearkened nor unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.9'>I, am the door: through me, if anyone enter, he shall be saved, and shall come in and go out, and, pasture, shall find.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>Because, a hireling, he is, and hath no care for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.14'>I, am the good shepherd, and know my own, and, my own, know me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.15'>Just as, the Father, knoweth me, and, I, know, the Father; and, my life, I lay down for the sheep.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>A division, again, took place among the Jews, because of these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>But many from among them were sayingA demon, he hath, and is raving,Why, unto him, do ye hearken?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>The Jews again lifted up stones, that they might stone him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus answered themMany works, have I showed you, noble ones, from my Father: For which of those works are ye stoning me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When, therefore, he heard that he was sick, then, indeed, he abode in the place where he was, two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then, after this, he saith unto the disciplesLet us be leading on into Judaea, again.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Jesus, therefore, coming, found that, four days already, had he been in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and, many from among the Jews, had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might console them concerning their brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Not yet, however, had Jesus come into the village, but was still in the place where, Martha, met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house and consoling her, seeing Mary, that quickly she arose and went out, followed her, supposing that she was withdrawing unto the tomb, that she might weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, seeing him, fell at his feet, saying unto himLord! if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, was indignant in the spirit, and troubled himself,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews, therefore, were sayingSee! how tenderly he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But, some from among them, saidCould not this man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that, this one also, should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus, therefore, again, being indignant within himself, cometh unto the tomb. Now it was a cave, and, a stone, was lying thereon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus, saith, Take ye away the stone! Martha, the sister of the deceased, saith unto himLord! by this time, he stinketh, for it is, four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus saith unto herSaid I not unto thee, that, if thou wouldst believe, thou shouldst see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone. And, Jesus, lifted up his eyes on high, and saidFather! I thank thee, thou didst hear me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>I, indeed, knew that, always, unto me, thou dost hearken; but, for the sake of the multitude standing around, I spake,that they might believe that, thou, didst send me forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And, these things, having said, with a loud voice, he cried outLazarus! Come forth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>He that was dead came forth, bound feet and hands with bandages, and, his face, with a napkin, was bound about. Jesus saith unto themLoose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many therefore from among the Jews, who had come unto Mary, and gazed on what he did, believed on him</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>but, certain from among them, went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>The High-priests and Pharisees, therefore, brought together a high-council, and were sayingWhat are we to do, in that, this man, doeth, many signs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him alone thus, all, will believe on him, and the Romans will come, and take away, both our place and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But, a certain one from among them, Caiaphas, being, High-priest, for that year, said unto themYe, know, nothing at all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do ye take into account, that it is profitable for you that, one man, should die for the people, and not, the whole nation, perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>This, however, from himself, he spake not, but, being, High-priest, for that year, he prophesied, that Jesus was about to die for the nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and, not for the nation only, but that, the scattered children of God also, he might gather together into one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>From that day, therefore, they took counsel, that they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus, therefore, no longer openly, was walking among the Jews, but departed thence, into the country near the desert, unto a city called, Ephraim; and, there, abode, with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went up unto Jerusalem, out of the country, before the passover, that they might purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They were therefore seeking Jesus, and were saying one to another, in the temple, standingHow seemeth it unto you? that he will in nowise come unto the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the High-priests and the Pharisees had given commands, that, if anyone came to know where he was, he should inform</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came unto Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>So they made for him a supper, there; and, Martha, was ministering, but, Lazarus, was one of them who were reclining with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary, therefore, taking a pound of pure nard perfume, very precious, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped, with her hair, his feet; and, the house, was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'> But  Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, he that was about to deliver him up, saith</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was, this perfume, not sold for three hundred denaries, and given unto the destitute?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>Howbeit he said this, not that, for the destitute, he cared, but because, a thief, he was, and holding, the bag, used to carry away, what was cast therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus, therefore, saidLet her alone, that, for the day of my burial, she may observe it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For, the destitute, always, have ye with you, whereas, me, not always, have ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>The great multitude of the Jews, therefore, got to know that he was, there, and came, not on account of Jesus only, but that, Lazarus also, they might see, whom he had raised from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the High-priests took counsel, that Lazarus also, they might put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because, many of the Jews, by reason of him, were withdrawing, and believing on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the morrow, the great multitude that had come unto the feast, hearing that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of the palm trees, and went out to meet him, and began crying aloudHosanna! Blessed is he that is coming in the name of the Lord,even the King of Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, finding a young ass, took his seat thereon, just as it is written</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things, his disciples noticed not, at the first; but, when Jesus was glorified, then, remembered they that, these things, had, for him, been written,and that, these things, they had done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The multitude, therefore, that was with him when he called, Lazarus, out of the tomb, and raised him from among the dead, was bearing witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>On this account, the multitude met him also, because they heard that he had done, this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>the Pharisees, therefore, said among themselvesYe observe that ye are profiting nothing: See! the world, after him, hath gone away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were certain Greeks, from among them who were coming up that they might worship in the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These, therefore, came unto Philip, him who was from Bethsaida of Galilee,and were requesting him, sayingSir! We desire to see, Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>But, Jesus, answereth them, sayingThe hour hath come, that the Son of Man should be glorified!</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>Having said these things, Jesus, went out, with his disciples, across the winter-torrent of the Kedron, where was a garden,into which he entered, he, and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>Now, Judas also, who was delivering him up, knew the place: because, oft, had Jesus been gathered there, with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>Judas, therefore, receiving the band, and officers, from among the High-priests and  from among  the Pharisees, cometh thither, with lights and torches and weapons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Jesus, therefore, knowing all the things coming upon him, went forth, and saith unto themWhom, seek ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered himJesus, the Nazarene. He saith unto themI, am he. Now Judas also, who was delivering him up, was standing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>When, therefore, he said unto them, I, am he, they went backwards, and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Again, therefore, he questioned themWhom, seek ye? And, they, saidJesus, the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus answeredI told you, I, am he. If, then, ye seek me, let these go their way:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>that the word might be fulfilled which he had saidAs touching them whom thou hast given me, I lost from among them, not so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Simon Peter, therefore, having a sword, drew it, and smote the High-priests servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Jesus, therefore, said unto PeterThrust the sword into its sheath:The cup which the Father hath given me, shall I in anywise not drink it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>The band, therefore, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, apprehended Jesus, and bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>and led him unto Annas, first; for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was the High-priest of that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>Now Caiaphas was he that gave counsel unto the Jews, that it was profitable for, one man, to die in behalf of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>And Simon Peter was following with Jesus, also another disciple. But, that disciple, was known unto the High-priest, and entered in, with Jesus, into the court of the High-priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>whereas, Peter, remained standing at the door outside. The other disciple, therefore, that was known of the High-priest, went out, and spake unto the portress, and brought in Peter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>Now the servants and the officers were standing by, having made, a coal fire, because it was cold,and were warming themselves; and Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>The High-priest, therefore, questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered himI, openly, have spoken, unto the world,I, ever, taught, in synagogue, and in the temple, where all the Jews gather together; and, in secret, spake nothing:</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Annas therefore sent him forth, bound, unto Caiaphas the High-priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They said, therefore, unto himArt, thou also, from among his disciples? He, denied, and saidI am not!</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Again, therefore, Peter denied. And, straightway, a cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>So they lead Jesus from Caiaphas unto the judgment-hall. Now it was early; and, they themselves, entered not into the judgment-hall, that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate, therefore, went forth outside unto them, and saith,What accusation bring ye against this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered and said unto himIf this one had not been doing, mischief, unto thee, had we not delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate, therefore, said unto themYe, take him, and, according to your law, judge ye him. The Jews said unto himUnto us, it is not allowed, to kill anyone!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>that, the word of Jesus, might be fulfilled, which he spake, signifying, by what manner of death, he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Pilate, therefore, entered again into the judgment-hall; and addressed Jesus, and said unto himArt, thou, the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answeredOf thyself, art, thou, this thing saying; or did, others, tell thee concerning me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answeredAm, I, a Jew? Thine own nation, and the High-priests, delivered thee up, unto me! What, hast thou done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answeredMy kingdom, is not of this world: If, of this world, had been my kingdom, mine own officers, would have been striving, that I should not be delivered up unto the Jews: but, now, my kingdom, is not from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate, therefore, said unto himAnd yet, thou, art, not a king? Jesus answeredThou, sayest, that, a king, I am: I, for this, have been born, and, for this, have come into the world,that I may bear witness unto the truth: Every one who is of the truth, hearkeneth unto my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate saith unto himWhat, is truth? And, this saying, again, went he out to the Jews, and saith unto them,I, find in him, not a single fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>Howbeit ye have, a custom, that, some one, I should release unto you, during the passover:Are ye minded, then, that I release unto you the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>So they cried aloud again, sayingNot this man, but Barabbas! Now, Barabbas, was, a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate, therefore, took Jesus, and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And, the soldiers, plaiting a crown out of thorns, placed it upon his head, and, a purple robe, cast they about him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and kept coming unto him, and sayingJoy to thee! O King of the Jews!and were giving unto him smart blows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>And Pilate went forth again outside, and saith unto themSee! I lead him unto you outside, that ye may take knowledge, that, no single fault, do I find in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Jesus, therefore, came forth outside, wearing the thorn crown, and the purple mantle. And he saith unto themLo! the Man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When, therefore, the High-priests and the officers saw him, they cried aloud, sayingCrucify! Crucify! Pilate saith unto themYe, take him, and crucify; for, I, find not in him, a fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered himWe, have, a law, and, according to the law, he ought to die, because, Son of God, himself, he made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When, therefore, Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and entered into the judgment-hail again, and saith unto JesusWhence, art, thou? But, Jesus, gave him no, answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate, therefore, saith unto himUnto me, dost thou not speak? Knowest thou not, that, authority, have I to release thee, and, authority, have I to crucify thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered himThou couldst have had no authority against me, at all, if it had not been given unto thee from above. Therefore, he that delivered me unto thee, hath, greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>For this cause, Pilate, began seeking to release him; but, the Jews, cried aloud sayingIf this man thou release, thou art not a friend of Caesar, for, every one who maketh himself king, speaketh against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate, therefore, when he heard these words, led Jesus outside, and sat down upon a raised seat, in a place called Pavement, but, in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the preparation of the passover,it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the JewsSee! your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>They, therefore, cried aloudAway! away! Crucify him! Pilate saith unto themYour king, shall I crucify? The High-priests answeredWe have no king but Caesar!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then, therefore, he delivered him up unto them, that he might be crucified. They took possession, therefore, of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And, bearing for himself the cross, he went forth unto the so-called Skull-place, which is named, in Hebrew, Golgotha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where, him, they crucified; and, with him, other two, on this side and on that, and, in the midst, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title also, and placed on the cross; and there was writtenJESUS, THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>This title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because, near, was the place to the city where Jesus was crucified; ad it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, in Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The High-priests of the Jews, therefore, were saying unto PilateDo not be writing, The King of the Jews; but that, he, said: King of the Jews, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answeredWhat I have written, I have written!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers, therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, unto each soldier, a part; also the tunic. Howbeit, the tunic was without seam, from above, woven throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said, therefore, one to anotherLet us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose, it shall be;that, the Scripture, might be fulfilledThey parted my garments amongst them, and, for my vestment, they cast lots:yes verily, the soldiers, these things did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>And there were standing by the cross of Jesus, his mother, and his mothers sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary the Magdalene.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>A vessel, was standing, full of vinegar. A sponge, therefore, full of the vinegar, put about, hyssop, brought they unto his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When, therefore, he had received the vinegar, Jesus saidIt is finished! And, bowing his head, delivered up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews, therefore, since it was, a preparation, that the bodies might not remain upon the cross during the Sabbath,for that Sabbath day was, great, requested Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers, therefore, came; and, of the first, indeed, brake the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>but coming, unto Jesus, when they saw that, already, he was dead, they brake not his legs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>but, one of the soldiers, with a spear, pierced, his side, and there came out, straightway, blood and water.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>and, again, a different Scripture, saithThey shall look unto him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>But, after these things, Joseph from Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but having kept it secret for fear of the Jews, requested Pilate, that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave permission. He came, therefore, and took away his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>There came, moreover, Nicodemus also,he that came unto him by night at the first,bearing a roll of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they received the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen-bandages with the spices,just as it is, a custom, with the Jews to prepare for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now there was, in the place where he was crucified, a garden; and, in the garden, an unused tomb, wherein, as yet, no one had been laid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And, he, said unto themCast the net, on the right side of the boat,and ye shall find. They cast, therefore; and, no longer, were they able, to draw, it, for the multitude of the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple, therefore, whom Jesus loved, saith unto PeterIt is, the Lord! Simon Peter, therefore, hearing that it was the Lord, girded about him, his upper garment,for he was naked; and cast himself into the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>but, the other disciples, came, by the little boat,for they were not farther from the land than about two hundred cubits off,dragging the net of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>So, when they got out upon the land, they behold a coal fire lying, and fish lying over, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus saith unto themBring of the fish which ye caught just now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter, therefore, went on board, and drew the net on to the land,full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and, though they were so many, the net was not rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus saith unto themCome! break your fast. Not one, of the disciples was venturing to ask him, Who art, thou? knowing that it was, the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth unto them; and the fish, in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This, already, is the third time Jesus was manifested unto the disciples, after he was raised from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When, therefore, they had broken their fast, Jesus saith unto Simon PeterSimon, son of John! lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto himYea, Lord! thou, knowest that I am fond of thee, he saith unto himBe feeding my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He saith unto him, again, the second timeSimon, son of John! lovest thou me? He saith unto himYea, Lord! thou, knowest that I am fond of thee. He saith unto himBe shepherding my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He saith unto him, the third timeSimon, son of John! art thou fond of me? Peter was grieved, that he said unto him, the third time, Art thou fond of me? and he said unto himLord! all things, thou, knowest: thou perceivest that I am fond of thee. Jesus saith unto himBe feeding my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Verily, verily, I say unto theeWhen thou wast younger, thou usedst to gird thyself, and to walk whither thou didst choose; but, when thou shalt become aged, thou shalt stretch out thy hands, and, another, shall gird thee, and bear thee, whither thou dost not choose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>Now, this, he said, signifying, by what manner of death, he should glorify God. And, having said this, he saith unto himBe following me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter, turning about, beholdeth the disciple whom Jesus loved, following,who also reclined during the supper upon his breast, and saidLord, who is it that is delivering thee up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter, therefore, seeing, this one, saith unto JesusLord! and, this one, what?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus saith unto himIf I will that, he, remain until I come, what is that to thee? Thou, be following me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>This word, therefore, went forth unto the brethren, that, that disciple, should not die. Howbeit, Jesus did not tell him, he should not die; but, If I will that, he, remain until I come, what is that to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This, is the disciple who beareth witness concerning these things, and who hath written these things; and we know that, true, is, his witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>Now there are many other things also, which Jesus did, which, indeed, if they were to be written one by one, not even the world, itself, I suppose, would contain, the books which must be written.</verse>
