      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <title>O Yahweh, God of Israel, righteous thou art, for we have had left us a deliverance as at this day,here we are, before thee, in our guilty deeds, for there is no standing before thee, because of this thing!</title>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The story of Nehemiah, son of Hacaliah,and it came to pass, in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, when, I, was in Shusan the fortress,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hanani one of my brethren came, he and certain men out of Judah,so I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said unto me, The remnant who are left of the captivity, there in the province, are in great misfortune and reproach, the wall of Jerusalem, is broken down, and, the gates thereof, are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and I mourned certain days,and continued fasting and praying, before the God of the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>and said, I beseech thee, O Yahweh God of the heavens, the great and fearful GOD,keeping the covenant and lovingkindness for them who love him and keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let, I pray thee, thine ears be attentive and thine eyes opento hearken unto the prayer of thy servant-which, I, am praying before thee now, day and night, for the sons of Israel, thy servants,-and making confession concerning the sins of the sons of Israel, which we have committed against thee, both I and the house of my father, have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>We have dealt, very corruptly, against thee,and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes nor the regulations, which thou didst command Moses thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I pray thee, the word, which thou didst command Moses thy servant, saying,If, ye, are unfaithful, I, will scatter you among the peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>When ye return unto me and keep my commandments and do them, though it should be that ye have been driven out unto the uttermost part of the heavens, from thence, will I gather them, and bring them into the place that I have chosen to make a habitation for my Name there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>They, therefore, are thy servants, and thy people,whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy firm hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>I beseech thee O My Lord, letI pray theethine ear be attentive unto the prayer of thy servant, and unto the prayer of thy servants who delight to revere thy Name, and oh prosper, I pray thee, thy servant to-day, and grant him compassion before this man. Now, I, was cup-bearer unto the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass, in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that, wine, was before him,so I took up the wine, and gave unto the king, and I had never been sad before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>Then said the king unto me, Wherefore is thy countenance sad, seeing that, thou, art not sick? this is nothing else, but sadness of heart. Then feared I exceedingly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>and said unto the kingLet the, king, unto times age-abiding, live! Wherefore should my countenance, not be sad, when, the citythe place of the sepulchres of my fathers, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said to me, Concerning what, is it, thou, wouldst make request? So I prayed unto the God of the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>and then said unto the king, If, unto the king, it seemeth good, and if thy servant might find favour before thee, That thou wouldst send me unto Judah, unto the city of the sepulchres of my fathers, that I might build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said unto me, the queen, also sitting beside him, For how long would be thy journey? and when wouldst thou return? So it seemed good before the king to send me, and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Then said I unto the king, If, unto the king, it seemeth good, may, letters, be given me, unto the pashas Beyond the River,that they may convey me over, until I come into Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>also a letter unto Asaph, keeper of the park that belongeth unto the king, that he may give me timber to build up the gates of the fortress which pertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house whereinto I shall enter. And the king gave me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then came I unto the pashas Beyond the River, and gave them the letters of the king,now the king, had sent with me, captains of the army, and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>And, when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, heard of it, it vexed them, with a great vexation,that there had come a man, to seek welfare, for the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I entered Jerusalem,and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>Then rose I by night, I, and a few men with me, I having told no man, what, my God, had been putting in my heart, to do for Jerusalem,and, beast, was there none with me, save the beast on which, I myself, was riding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>So I went forth through the valley-gate by night, even unto the front of the snake-fountain, and into the dung-gate,and I viewed the walls of Jerusalem, how, they, were broken down, and, the gates thereof, consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then passed I over unto the fountain-gate, and unto the pool of the king,but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then went I up in the torrent-bed, by night, and viewed the wall,and turned back, and entered by the valley-gate, and so returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>Now, the deputies, knew not whither I had gone, nor what I was doing,not even to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the deputies, nor to the rest who were doing the work, had I as yet told it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>So I said unto them, Ye, can see the misfortune that, we, are in, how that, Jerusalem, lieth waste, and, the gates thereof, are burned with fire: Come, and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, that we may remain, no longer, a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>Then told I them, of the hand of my God, that, it, had been good upon me, as also of the words of the king, which he had spoken unto me,so they said, We will arise and build! and they strengthened their hands right well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But, when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed at us, and poured contempt upon us,and said, What is this thing which ye would do? against the king, would ye rebel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then answered I them, and said to themThe God of the heavenshe, will prosper us, therefore, we his servants, will arise and build,But, to you, pertaineth no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then arose Eliashib the high priest and his brethren the priests, and built the sheep-gate, they, hallowed it, and set up the doors thereof,even unto the tower of Hammeah, hallowed they it, unto the tower of Hananel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>and, at his hand, built, the men of Jericho,and at his   hand built Zaccur, son of Imri.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>But it came to pass, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, it angered him, and he was greatly displeased,and mocked the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>and spake before his brethren, and the army of Samaria, and said, What are, these feeble Jews, doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they bring to life the stones out of the heaps of dust, when, they, have been burned up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now, Tobiah the Ammonite, was beside him,so he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox should go up, he would break down their stone wall!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, O our God, for we have become a contempt, and turn thou back their reproach upon their own head,and give them up as a prey, in the land of captivity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>and do not cover their iniquity, and, their sin before thee, let it not be blotted out,for they have caused vexation before them who are building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall, and all the wall was finished unto the half thereof,-and the people had a mind to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>But it came to pass, when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites heard that the repair of the walls of Jerusalem had gone up, that the breaches began to be stopped, that it angered them exceedingly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and they conspired, all of them together, to come, to fight against Jerusalem,and to cause it harm;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>howbeit we prayed unto our God,and set a watch against them, day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>Then said Judah, The strength of the burden-bearer faileth, and, the rubbish, aboundeth,and, we, are not able to build at the wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>and our adversaries have said, They shall not know, neither shall they see, until we come into their midst, and slay them,so shall we cause the work to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>But it came to pass, when the Jews dwelling near them came in, then said they unto us, ten times, From all places whither ye shall turn,   upon us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>So I seton the lower slopes of the place behind the wall in the waste grounds,yea I set the people, by their families, with their swords, their spears and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>Then I looked and rose up, and saidunto the nobles and unto the deputies and unto the rest of the people, Do not ye fear because of them,the great and fearful Lord, remember ye, so shall ye fight for your brethren, your sons and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and that God had overturned their counsel, then returned we, all of us, unto the wall, every man unto his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass, from that day, the half of my young men, were working in the work, and, the half of them, were grasping the spears, the bucklers, and the bows, and the coats of mail,but, the rulers, were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>They who were building at the wall and they who were carrying burdens, they who were lifting,   , with his one hand, was working at the work, and, with the other, was grasping the weapon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>Even they who were building, every man, had his sword girded upon his loins, and so was building,and, he that sounded the horn, was by my side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>So I said unto the nobles and unto the deputies, and unto the rest of the people, The work, is great and large,and, we, are separated upon the wall, far away, each man from his brother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>In what place soever ye shall hear the sound of the horn, thither, gather yourselves unto us,our God, will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So, we, were working at the work,one half of them, grasping the spears, from the uprisings of the dawn, until the coming out of the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>Moreover, at that time, I said to the people, Let, every one with his young man, lodge for the night in the midst of Jerusalem,so shall they serve us, in the night, as a watch, and, the day, for work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my young men, nor the men of the watch that followed me, none of us, put off our clothes,every one</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Then came there to be a great outcry of the people and their wives,against their brethren the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>And there were some who were saying, Our sons and our daughters, are we pledging,that we may obtain corn, and eat, and keep ourselves alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>And there were some who were saying, Our fields and our vineyards and our houses, are we pledging,-that we may obtain corn in the dearth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>And there were others who were saying, We have borrowed silver, for the kings tribute,  our lands and our vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Now, therefore, as is the flesh of our brethren, so is our flesh, as are their children, so are our children. Yet lo! we are putting in subjection our sons and our daughters, for bondservants, yea there are some of our daughters already trodden down, and we are powerless, and, our fields and our vineyards, belong to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And it angered me greatly,when I heard their outcry, and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>So my heart took counsel unto me and I contended with the nobles and with the deputies, and said to them, A loan on interestevery man to his brother, are ye making,So I appointed over them a great assembly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>and I said unto them, We, have bought our brethren the Jews, who had sold themselves unto the nations, according to our ability, and will, ye, even sell your brethren, or shall they sell themselves unto us? And they were silent, and found no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Then said I, Not good, is the thing which ye are doing,ought ye not, in the fear of God, to walk, because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>I too, then, my brethren and my young men, might be lending unto them on interest silver and corn! I pray you, let us leave off this lending on interest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore, I pray you, unto them this very day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses,also the hundredth of silver and corn, new wine and oil, for which ye have been lending to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>And they said, We will restore them, and, from them, will we require nothing, so, will we do, as thou, art saying. Then called I the priests, and put them on oath, to do according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also, my lap, shook I out, and saidThus and thus, may God shake out every man who shall not confirm this promise, out of his house and out of his labour, yea, thus and thus, let him be shaken out and empty,And all the convocation said, Amen! and praised Yahweh, and the people did according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover, from the day I was commanded to become their pasha in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year, even unto the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I and my brethren, pashas bread, have not eaten;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>whereas, the former pashas, who were before me, suffered themselves to be a burden upon the people, and took from them in bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver, even, their young men, bare rule over the people,but, I, did not so, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Moreover also, in this work of the wall, I repaired, and, no field, did we buy,though, all my young men, were gathered thither unto the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>And, Jews and deputies, a hundred and fifty men, and they who were coming in unto us from among the nations which were round about us,   upon my table.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>And it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arabian and to the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall, and there was left therein no breach,though, up to that time, the doors, had I not set up in the gates,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come! and let us meet together in the villages, in the valley of Ono,But, they, were plotting to do me harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>So I sent unto them messengers, saying, A great work, am, I, doing, and cannot come down,wherefore should the work cease whilst I leave it, and come down unto you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>Yet they sent unto me, according to this message, four times,and I replied to them according to this answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then Sanballat sent unto me, according to this message, a fifth time, by his young man,with an open letter, in his hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>wherein was writtenAmong the nations, it is reported, and, Gashmu, saith it, that, thou and the Jews, are plotting to rebel, for which cause, thou art building the wall,and, thou, art to become their king, according to these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>Moreover also, prophets, hast thou set up to make proclamation concerning thee in Jerusalem, saying, He hath become king in Judah! Now, therefore, will it he reported to the king, according to these words. Now, therefore, come, and let us take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then sent I unto him, saying, Nothing hath been done, according to these words, which thou art saying,but, out of thine own heart, art thou feigning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For, they all, were seeking to put us in fear, saying, Their hands will slacken from the work, and it will not be accomplished. Now, therefore, strengthen thou my hands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>When, I, came into the house of Shemaiah, son of Delaiah, son of Mehetabel, he, being shut in, he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, in the midst of the temple, and let us close the doors of the temple, for they are coming to slay thee, yea, by night, are they coming to slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>Then said I, Should, such a man as I, flee? Who then, being such as I, would enter the temple to save his life? I will not enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>Then perceived I, that lo! it was, not God, who had sent him,though, a prophecy, he had spoken concerning me, but, Tobiah and Sanballat, had hired him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>to this end, hired, he was, to the end that I might be afraid and do so, and might sin,and it might serve them for an evil report, to the end they might bring reproach upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>Have remembrance, O my God, of Tobiah and of Sanballat, according to these their doings,moreover also, of Noadiah the prophetess, and of the rest of the prophets, who would have put me in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished, on the twenty-fifth of Elul,in fifty-two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard, and all the nations that were round about us saw, that they fell greatly in their own eyes, and took knowledge that, from God, had this work been wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover, in those days, were the nobles of Judah busy with their letters which were going unto Tobiah,and those of Tobiah were coming unto them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>for, many in Judah, had taken an oath to him, because he was in marriage affinity with Shecaniah son of Arah,and, Jehohanan his son, had taken the daughter of Meshullam, son of Berechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Moreover, his good deeds, were they telling before me, and, my affairs, were they carrying out to him,letters, did Tobiah send to put me in fear.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Neh.7'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>And it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors,and the doorkeepers and the singers and the Levites had been appointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.2'>that I gave Hanani my brother, and Hananiah captain of the castle, charge over Jerusalem, for, he, was a truly faithful man, and revered God above many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.3'>And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until, hot, be the sun, and, while they are standing by, let them close the doors, and make them fast,setting watches, of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one over against his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.4'>Now, the city, was broad on both hands, and large, but, the people, were few in the midst thereof,and the houses had not been built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.7.5'>So then my God put it into my heart, and I gathered together the nobles and the deputies and the people, to register their genealogy,then found I a register roll, of them who came up at the first, and found written therein:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.1'>On that day, a portion, was read in the book of Moses, in the ears of the people,and it was found written therein, that the Ammonite and the Moabite should not enter into the convocation of God, unto times age-abiding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.2'>because they met not the sons of Israel, with bread and with water,but hired against them Balaam, to curse them, although our God turned the curse into a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.3'>So it came to pass, when they had heard the law,that they separated all the mixed multitude from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.4'>Now, before this, Eliashib the priest, who was set over a chamber of the house of God, was allied unto Tobiah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.5'>so he prepared him a large chamber, where aforetime they used to lay the meal-offering, the frankincense, and the utensils, and the tithe of the corn, the new wine and the oil, in charge of the Levites, and the singers, and the doorkeepers,and the heave-offerings for the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.6'>But, throughout all this   , was I not in Jerusalem,for, in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon, I came unto the king, and, at the end of certain days, obtained I leave of the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.7'>and came to Jerusalem,and had intelligence of the wickedness which Eliashib had committed for Tobiah, in preparing for him a chamber, in the courts of the house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.8'>and it grieved me exceedingly,and I cast forth all the household utensils of Tobiah, outside of the chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.9'>Then commanded I, and they purified the chambers,and I put back there, the utensils of the house of God, the meal-offering and the frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.10'>Then came I to know, that, the portions of the Levites, had not been given   ,so that the Levites and the singers, who had been doing the work, had fled every one to his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.11'>Therefore contended I with the deputies, and said, Wherefore is the house of God, forsaken? So I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.12'>Then, all Judah, brought in the tithe of corn, and new wine, and oil, unto the treasuries;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>and I made treasurers over the treasuriesShelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from among the Levites, and, next unto them, Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah,for faithful were they accounted, and it was   upon them to distribute unto their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this,and do not wipe out my lovingkindnesses, which I have done for the house of my God, and for those keeping charge thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days, saw I in Judahsome treading winepresses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves and lading asses, moreover also wine, grapes, and figs, and every kind of burden, which they were bringing into Jerusalem on the sabbath day,so I protested against it, as a day for them to sell provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>And, men of Tyre, dwelt therein, who were bringing in fishand every kind of ware for sale,and were selling, on the sabbath, to the sons of Judah, and in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>so I contended with the nobles of Judah,and said unto them, What is this wicked thing which, ye, are doing, and profaning the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Was it not, thus, your fathers did, and our God brought upon us all this calamity, and upon this city?and, ye, would add indignation against Israel, by profaning the sabbath!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem made a shadow before the sabbath, then gave I word, and they shut the doors, and I gave word, that they should not open them, until after the sabbath,and, some of my young men, set I near the gates, so that no burden should be brought in, on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>But the traders and sellers of all kinds of wares lodged outside Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Therefore I testified against them, and said unto them, Wherefore are ye lodging against the wall? if ye do it again, a hand, will I thrust upon you,From that time, they came not on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I gave word to the Levites, that they should be purifying themselves and coming in, as keepers of the gates, to hallow the sabbath day. This also, remember to me, O my God, and have pity upon me, according to the abundance of thy lovingkindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>Moreover, in these days, saw I the Jews who had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>and, their children, were one-half speaking the language of Ashdod, and understood not how to speak the language of the Jews,but after the tongue of both people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>So I contended with them, and laid a curse upon them, and I smote, from among them, certain men, and pulled out their hair,and I put them on oath by God, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take of their daughters, for your sons nor for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Was it not, over these things, that Solomon king of Israel sinnedthough, among many nations, there was no king such as he, and he was, beloved by his God, and so God gave him to be king over all Israel,even him, did foreign women, cause to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Unto you, then, shall we hearken, to do all this great wickedness, to act unfaithfully with our God,by marrying foreign wives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And, one of the sons of Joiada, son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite,therefore I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O my God,on account of the Defilings of the Priesthood, and the Covenant of the Priesthood, and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>So I purified them from everything foreign,and appointed charges unto the priests and unto the Levites, every one in his work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>also for the offering of wood, at times appointed, and for the firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good!</verse>
