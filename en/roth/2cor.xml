      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <title>So, then, my beloved brethren,become ye, steadfast, immovable, superabounding in the work of the Lord, at all times; knowing that, your toil, is not in vain in the Lord.</title>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, through the will of God, and Timothy the brother,unto the assembly of God which is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Favour unto you, and peace, from God</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed, be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of compassions, and God of all encouragement,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>Who encourageth us in all our tribulation, to the end we may be able to encourage them who are in any tribulationthrough means of the encouragement wherewith we, ourselves, are encouraged by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>Because, even as the sufferings of the Christ overflow unto us, so, through the Christ, overfloweth, our encouragement also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>But, whether we are in tribulation, it is for your encouragement and salvation; whether we are encouraged, it is for your encouragement, which worketh inwardly by the endurance of the same sufferings which, we also, suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And so, our hope, is sure in your behalf,knowing that,as ye are sharers of the sufferings, so, also of the encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, as to our tribulation which happened in Asia,that, exceedingly, beyond power, were we weighed down, so that we despaired, even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>But, we ourselves, within ourselves, have had the sentence of death, that we might not rest our confidence upon ourselves, but upon God, who raiseth the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>Who, out of so great a death, rescued us, and will rescue,unto whom we have turned our hope,  that , even yet, he will rescue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>Ye also labouring together on our behalf, by your supplication, that, unto many persons, being due the gift of favour, unto us, through means of many, might thanks be given in our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For, our boasting, is, this,the witness of our conscience, that, in sanctity and sincerity of God,  and  not in fleshly wisdom, but in Gods favour, have we behaved ourselves in the world,and more abundantly towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For, no other things, are we writing unto you, than what ye are either reading or even acknowledging,I hope, moreover, that, throughout, ye will acknowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>According as ye have also acknowledged us, in part,that, your theme of boasting, we are, even indeed as, ye, also</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And, in this confidence, I purposed, before, to come unto you,in order that, a second joy, ye might have,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>And, by your means, to pass into Macedonia, and, again, from Macedonia, to come unto you, and, by you, be set forward unto Judea:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>This, then, being my purpose, perhaps, after all, with lightness, I dealt   ? or, the things that I purpose, according to the flesh, I purpose,that, with me, should be the Yea, yea, and the Nay, nay?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>Faithful, however, is God, in that, our discourse, which was   unto you, is not Yea and Nay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For, the Son of God, Christ Jesuswho, among you, through us, was proclaimed,through me, and Silvanus, and Timothy, became not Yea and Nay,but Yea, in him, hath it become;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For, how many soever be the promises of God, in him, is the Yea,wherefore also, through him,   the Amen, unto God, for glory, through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now, he that confirmeth us, together with you, for Christ, and hath anointed us, is God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>Who also hath sealed us, and given the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>But, I, call upon God, as a witness, against my own soul,that, to spare you, not yet, have I come unto Corinth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we have lordship over your faith, but are, helpers, of your joy, for, by your faith, ye stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>For I have determined, unto myself, thisnot, again, in grief, to come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For, if, I, grieve you, who then is he that is to gladden me,save he who is being grieved through me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this very thinglest, if I came, I should have, grief, from those over whom I had need to rejoice,having confidence in you all, that, my joy, is the joy, of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For, out of much tribulation and anguish of heart, wrote I unto you, through many tears,not that ye might be grieved, but that, the love, ye might know, which I have very abundantly unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>Now, if anyone hath caused grief, not unto me hath he caused grief, butthat I may not bear too heavilyunto you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient, unto such a one, the punishment itself which   by the many;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So that, on the contrary, ye should forgive and encourage, lest, by any means, by his excessive grief, such a one should be swallowed up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Wherefore, I beseech you, assure him, of love;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For, to this end, I also wrote,that I might know the proof of you, whether, in all things, ye are obedient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>Now, to whom ye forgive anything, I, also; for, I also, what I have forgiven, if, anything, I have forgiven, for your sake, in the person of Christ,   .</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>Lest we should be overreached by Satan, for, of his thoughts, we are not ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Moreover, although I came unto Troas for the glad-message of the Christ, and a door for me had been opened in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no relief in my spirit, because I found not Titus my brother; but, taking my leave of them, I came away into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>But, unto God, be thanks, who, ever, leadeth us in triumph in the Christ, and, the fragrance of the knowledge of him, maketh manifest, through us, in every place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>That, of Christ, a grateful odour, are we, unto God,in them who are being saved, and in them who are being lost:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>In these, indeed, a fragrance out of death into death, but, in those, a fragrance out of life into life. And, for these things, who is sufficient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not, as the many, driving a petty trade with the word of God; but, as of sincerity, but, as of God, before God, in Christ, we speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Are we to begin again, ourselves, to commend? or have we need, like some, of commendatory letters unto you, or from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>Our letter, ye, are, inscribed in our hearts, noted and read by all men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>Manifesting yourselves that ye are a letter of Christ, ministered by us,inscribednot with ink, but with   hearts of flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>But, such confidence as this, have we, through the Christ, towards God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that, of our own selves, sufficient, are we, to reckon anything as of ourselves, but, our sufficiency, is of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>Who also hath made us sufficient to be ministers of a new covenantnot of letter, but of spirit, for, the letter, killeth, whereas, the Spirit, maketh alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>But, if, the ministry of death, in letters engraven in stones, was brought into existence with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look steadfastly into the face of Moses, by reason of the glory of his facewhich   was to be done away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>How shall not, rather, the ministry of the Spirit, be with glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For, if, the ministry of condemnation was glory, much rather, doth the ministry of righteousness abound with glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For that which hath been made glorious, hath not even been made glorious, in this respect,by reason of the surpassing glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For, if that which was to be done away</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having, then, such hope as this, great openness of speech, do we use;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>And are not just like Moses,   kept putting a veil upon his face, so that the sons of Israel should not look steadily unto the end of that which was to be done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their thoughts were turned into stone: for, until this very day, the same veil, upon the reading of the old covenant, abideth, not to be removed, because, in Christ, it is to be done away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But, until this day, whensoever Moses is read, a veil upon their heart, doth lie;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>Howbeit, whensoever he turneth unto   Lord, he taketh off the veil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>And, the Lord, is, the Spirit: now, where the Spirit of one who is Lord   freedom!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>And, we all, with unveiled face, receiving and reflecting, the glory of</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Wherefore, having this ministry, even as we received mercy, we faint not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully,but, by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves unto every conscience of men, in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>And, even if our glad-message is veiled, in them who are perishing, it is veiled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>In whom, the god of this age, hath blinded the minds of the unbelieving, to the end they may not discern the radiance e of the glad-message of the glory of the Christwho is the image of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For, not ourselves, do we proclaim, but Christ Jesus, as Lord, and, ourselves, as your servants for Jesus sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>Because, the God who saidOut of darkness, light shall shine!   who hath shone in our hearts, in proportion to the radiance of the glorious knowledge of God, in the face of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>Howbeit we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that, the surpassing greatness of the power, may be of God, and not from ourselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>On every side, pressed hard, but not hemmed in, without a way, but not without a by-way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>Pursued, but not abandoned, thrown down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>At all times, the putting to death of Jesus, in our body, bearing about, in order that, the life also of Jesus, in our body, may be made manifest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For, evermore, we, the living, unto death are being delivered, for Jesus sake, in order that, the life also of Jesus, may be made manifest in our mortal flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So that, his death, in us, doth energise, but, his life, in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>Howbeit, seeing that we have the same spirit of faith, according to that which is writtenI believed, therefore I spake, we, also believe, therefore also we speak:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>Knowing that, he who raised up  the Lord  Jesus, will raise up, us also, together with Jesus, and will present   together with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For, all things, are for your sakes, in order that, the favour abounding, may, through means of the greater number, cause, the thanksgiving, to superabound unto the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Wherefore we faint not, but, even if, our outer man, is decaying, nevertheless, our inner   , is renewing day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For, the momentary lightness of thee tribulation, in a manner yet more and more excelling, is working out for us, an age-abiding weight of glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>So long as we are not looking out for the visible things, but for the invisible; for, the visible things, are temporary, whereas, the invisible, are age-abiding.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that-if, our earthly tent-dwelling, should be taken down, we have, a building of God, a dwelling not made by hand, age-abiding in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>And verily, in this, we sigh, earnestly desiring to clothe ourselves over, with our habitation which is of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>Although, indeed, even clothing ourselves, we shall not be found, naked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>And verily, we who are in the tent, do sigh, being weighed down, while yet we are not wishing to unclothe ourselves, but to clothe ourselves over,in order that, what is mortal, may be swallowed up, by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now, he that hath wrought us for this very thing, is, God,who hath given unto us the earnest of the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Having good courage, therefore, at all times, and knowing thatremaining at home in the body, we are away from home from the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>By faith, are we walking, not by sight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We have good courage, however, and are well pleasedrather to be away from home, out of the body, and to come home, unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Wherefore also we are ambitiouswhether at home, or away from home, to be, well-pleasing unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For, we all, must needs be made manifest before the judgment seat of the Christ, that each one may get back the things done by means of the body, according to the things which he practised, whether good or corrupt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing, then, the fear of the Lord, we persuade, men, but, unto God, are manifest,I hope, moreover, even in your consciences, that we are manifest:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>Not again, ourselves, do we commend unto you, but as though an occasion we were giving unto yousomething to boast of, in our behalf; that ye may have something suited unto them who, in appearance, are boasting, and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For, whether we have been beside ourselves, it hath been for God, or, whether we are sober-minded, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For, the love of the Christ, constraineth us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>Having judged this,that, one, in behalf of all, died, hence, they all, died; and, in behalf of all, died he,in order that, they who live, no longer for themselves, should live, but for him who, in their behalf, died and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So that, we, henceforth, know, no one, after the flesh: if we have even been gaining, after the flesh, a knowledge of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>On the contrary, now, no longer, are we gaining it. So that, if any one is in Christ, there is a new creation! the old things, have passed away,Lo! they have become new!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>The all things, moreover, are of God,who hath reconciled us unto himself, through Christ, and hath given, unto us, the reconciling ministry:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>How that, God, was in Christ, reconciling, a world, unto himself, not reckoning, unto them, their offences,and hath put, in us, the reconciling discourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>In behalf of Christ, therefore, are we ambassadors,as if God were beseeching through us: we entreat, in behalf of Christ,be reconciled unto God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>Him who knew not sin, in our behalf, he made to be, sin, that we might become Gods righteousness in him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>As co-workers, however, we also beseech, that, not in vain, the favour of God, ye welcome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For he saithIn an approved season, have I hearkened unto thee, and, in a day of salvation, have succoured thee;Lo! now, a well-approved season, Lo! now, a day of salvation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Giving, no single, occasion of stumbling, in anything, that the ministry be not blamed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>But, in everything, commending ourselves as Gods ministers,in much endurance, in tribulations, in necessities, in straits,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in stripes, in imprisonments, in tumults, in toilings, in watchings, in fastings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in sanctity, in knowledge, in long-suffering, in graciousness, in Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>in love unfeigned, in discourse of truth, in power of God; through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and left,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through glory and dishonour, through bad report and good report; as deceivers, and yet true,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, and yet well-known, as dying, and lo! we live, as disciplined, and yet not put to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as grieving, yet, ever, rejoicing, as destitute, yet making, many, rich, as holding, nothing, and yet firmly holding, all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>Our mouth, is opened unto you, O Corinthians! our heart, hath become enlarged:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>Ye are not straitened in us, but are straitened in your hearts affections;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Howbeit, by way of the like recompenseas, unto children, I speak, be enlarged, even, ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Be not getting diversely yoked with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness? Or what fellowship hath light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what concord hath Christ with Beliar? Or what part hath a believer with an unbeliever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what agreement hath a shrine of God with idols? For, we, are   shrine of a God, that liveth:even as God hath saidwill dwell in them, and walk, and will be their God, and, they, shall be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Wherefore come ye forth out of their midst, and be separated,saith   Lord,and, one impure, do not touch; and, I, will give you welcome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>And will become your Father, and, ye, shall become my sons and daughters, saith</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Having therefore, these, promises, beloved, let us purify ourselves from all pollution of flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Give place to us! no one, have we wronged, no one, have we corrupted, no one, have we defrauded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>Unto condemnation, I am not saying   , for I have before saidIn our hearts, are ye, to the end we may die together and live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great, is my freedom of speech towards you, great, is my boasting in behalf of you: I am filled with the encouragement, I am greatly superabounding with the joy, in all our tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For, even when we came into Macedonia, no relief at all, had our flesh; but, in every way, were we in tribulation,without, fightings! within, fears!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>But, he who encourageth them that are brought low, encouraged us,even God,by the presence of Titus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>Because, if I even grieved you by the letter, I do not regret,though I could even have regretted,I see that that letter, if even for an hour, did cause you grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now, am I rejoicing,not that ye were grieved, but that ye were grieved unto repentance; for ye were grieved according to God, in order that, in nothing, should ye receive damage from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For, grief according to God, worketh, repentance unto salvation, not to be regretted; although, the grieving of the world, worketh, death.</verse>

In every way, ye shewed yourselves to be, chaste, in the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Hence, if I even wrote unto you, it was not for the sake of him that did the wrong,  nay  not even for the sake of him that suffered the wrong; but for the sake of your earnestness, which was on our account, being made manifest unto you, before God:-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>For this cause, have we received encouragement. In addition to our encouragement, however, much more abundantly, have we rejoiced over the joy of Titus,that his spirit hath received refreshment from you all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>That, if in anythingunto himin your behalfI have boasted, I have not been put to shame; but, as, all things, in truth, we told you, so, even our boasting before Titus, turned out to be, truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And, his tender affections, are, much more abundantly towards you, when he calleth to mind the obedience, of you all,how, with fear and trembling, ye gave him welcome.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>Moreover God is able to cause, every gracious gift, to superabound unto you, in order that, having in every thing, at every time, every kind of sufficiency of your own, ye may be superabounding unto every good work;</verse>
