      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <title>So Jacob made an end of commanding his sons, and gathered up his feet into the couch,and ceased to breathe and was gathered unto his people.</title>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>Now, these, are the names of the Sons of Israel, who came into Egypt, with Jacob, did each man and his household come in:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zebulon, and Benjamin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>And it came to pass that all the persons who were descended from Jacob were seventy souls,but, Joseph, was already in Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>So then Joseph died and all his brethren, and all that generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>But the sons of Israel, were fruitful and swarmed and multiplied and waxed mighty, with exceeding vigour,so that the land was filled with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>Then arose a new king over Egypt,who had not known Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>So he said, unto his people, Lo! the people of the sons of Israel are too many and mighty for us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come on! let us shew ourselves wise with regard to them, lest they so multiply that it shall come to pass when war befalleth us, that they also, shall join themselves unto them who hate us, and shall make war upon us. and then go up out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>So they set over them chiefs of tribute, to the end they might humiliate them with their burdens,and they built store-cities for Pharaoh, even Pithom and Raamses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they were humiliating them, the more, were they multiplying, and, the more, were they breaking forth, so they were filled with alarm because of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>And the Egyptians rigorously made the sons of Israel serve;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>and embittered their lives with harsh service, in clay and in bricks, and in all manner of service in the field,all their service, wherein they rigorously made them serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>Then said the king of Egypt to the Hebrew midwives,of whom, the name of the one was, Shiphrah, and, the name of the other Puah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>then he saidWhen ye act as midwives unto the Hebrew women, then shall ye look out for the sex,If it is, a son, then shall ye kill it, But, if it is, a daughter, then shall it live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt spake unto them,but suffered the male children to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>Then called the king of Egypt for the midwives, and said to themWherefore have ye done this thing, that ye should let the male children live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>And the midwives said unto Pharaoh. Because not like the Egyptian women, are the Hebrew women, for they are full of life, ere yes the midwife can come in unto them, they have given birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>So then God dealt well with the midwives,and the people multiplied, and waxed exceeding mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made for them households.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>Then gave Pharaoh command to all his people sayingEvery son that is born to the Hebrews, into the river, shall ye cast him; But every daughter, shall ye suffer to live.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>And there went a man of the house of Levi,and took a laughter of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And the woman conceived and bare a son,and she saw him, that he was a goodly child, so she hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of paper-reed, and covered it over with bitumen, and with pitch,and put therein the child, and laid it among the rushes upon the bank of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>Then did his sister station herself at a distance,to see what would be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>So then the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe by the river, and her, maidens, were walking by the side of the river,when she saw the ark in the midst of the rushes, and sent her handmaid, and fetched it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>And she opened and beheld iteven the child, and lo! a boy weeping,so she took pity on him, and said, Of the children of the Hebrews, is this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>Then said his sister unto Pharaohs daughter, Shall I go and call thee a nurse, of the Hebrew women,that she may nurse for thee the child?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>And Pharaohs daughter said to herGo. So the maid went, and called the mother of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>And Pharaohs daughter said to herTake this child, and nurse it for me, and, I, will give thee thy wages. So the woman took the child, and nursed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And the child grew, and she brought him in to Pharaohs daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and saidFor out of the water, I drew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>And it came to pass in those days when Moses grew up, that he went out unto his brethren, and looked on their burdens,and saw, an Egyptian smiting a Hebrewof his brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>So he turned this way and that, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And he went out on the second day, and lo! two Hebrews, striving together,so he said to him that did the wrong, Wherefore shouldest thou smite thy fellow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And he saidWho hath set thee for a chief and a judge over us? To slay me, art thou thinking, as thou didst slay the Egyptian? Then was Moses afraid, and saidSurely the thing is, known!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>So Pharaoh heard this thing, and sought to slay Moses,and Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian and sat down by the well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>Now, the priest of Midian, had seven daughters,and they came and drew and filled the troughs, to water their fathers flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>Then came the shepherds, and drave them away,so Moses rose up, and succoured them, and watered their flock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>Then came they in unto Reuel their father,and he said, Wherefore have ye so early come in to-day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And they said, An Egyptian, delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds,Moreover also he drew, for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And he said unto his daughtersAnd where is he? wherefore is it that ye left the man? Call him that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses was well-pleased to dwell with the man,and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bare a son, and he called his name Gershom,for he said, A, sojourner, I am, in a strange land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And it came to pass, during those many days, that the king of Egypt died, and the sons of Israel sighed by reason of the servitude and lamented,and their cry for help went up to God, by reason of the servitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>And God heard their groaning,and God remembered his covenant, with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>so then, God looked upon the sons of Israel,and God regarded.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>Now, Moses, was shepherding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law priest of Midian,so he led forth the flock behind the desert, and came in unto the mountain of God to Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>Then appeared the messenger of Yahweh unto him, in a flame of fire from the midst of the thorn-bush,so he looked and lo! the thorn-bush burning with fire and yet the thorn-bush, was not consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And, Moses said, Let me turn aside, pray, and see this great sight,why the thorn-bush, doth not burn up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And Yahweh saw, that he turned aside to see,so God called unto him out of the midst of the thorn-bush, and saidMoses! Moses! And he saidBehold me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And he saidDo not draw nigh hither,put off thy sandals from thy feet, for, the place whereon thou art standing is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>And he saidI, am the God of thy father, God of Abraham, God of Isaac and God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>Then said Yahweh, I have, seen, the humiliation of my people, who are in Egypt,and their outcry, have I heard, by reason of their task-masters, for I know their pains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>therefore have I come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to take them up out of that land, into a land good and large, into a land flowing with milk and honey,into the place of the Canaanite and the Hittite, and the Amorite and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>Now, therefore, lo! the outcry of the sons of Israel, hath come in unto me,moreover also, I have seen the oppression, wherewith the Egyptians are oppressing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>Now, therefore, come thou! that I may send thee unto Pharaoh,and bring thou forth my peoplethe sons of Israelout of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said unto God, Who am, I, that I should go unto Pharaoh,and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And he saidI will be with thee, and, this, to thee,   the sign, that, I have sent thee,When thou bringest forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall do service unto God, upon this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>And Moses said unto GodLo! as surely as, I, go in unto the sons of Israel, and say unto them, The God of your fathers, hath sent me unto you, So surely will they say unto meWhat is his name? What shall I say unto them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And God said unto Moses, I Will Become whatsoever I please, And he saidThus, shalt thou say to the sons of Israel, I Will Become hath sent me unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God said yet further unto MosesThus shalt thou say unto the sons of Israel, Yahweh God of your fathers. God of Abraham God of Isaac and God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you. This, is my name to times age-abiding, And, this, my memorial to generation after generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Goand thou shalt gather together the eiders of Israel and shalt say unto them-Yahweh. God of your fathers, hath appeared unto me, the God of Abraham Isaac, and Jacob saying,I am, concerned, for you, and for what is done to you in Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>therefore do I sayI will bring you up out of the humiliation of Egypt, into the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite, and the Amorite and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite,into a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>So will they hearken to thy voice,and thou shalt go inthou, and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt and ye shall say unto himYahweh, God of the Hebrews, hath fallen in with us, Now, therefore let us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the desert, that we may sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>But, I, know, that the king of Egypt will not suffer you to go,not even by a firm hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>So then I will put forth my hand and smite Egypt, with all my wonders, which I will d in the midst thereof,and, after that, he will send you forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>Thus will I give favour to this people in the eyes of the Egyptians,so shall it come to pass that when ye do go, ye shall not go empty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold and mantles,and ye shall put them upon your sons and upon your daughters, so shall ye spoil the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>Then responded Moses, and said, And lo! they will not believe me, neither hearken to my voice,for they will say, Yahweh, hath not appeared unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>And Yahweh said unto himWhat is this in thy hand? And he saidA staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>Then said heCast it to the earth. And he cast it to the earth, and it became a serpent,and Moses fled from the face thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>And Yahweh said unto Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by its tail: So he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a staff in his hand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>that they may believe that Yahweh, God of their fathers,God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob hath appeared unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>Then said Yahweh unto him, yet againBring, I pray thee, thy hand, into thy bosom. So he brought his hand, into his bosom,and then took it out, and lo! his hand, was leprous,like snow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>And he saidPut back thy hand into thy bosom: So he put back his hand into his bosom,and then took it out of his bosom, and lo it had come again like his own flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>thus shall it come to pass, if they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the voice of the first sign, then will they believe the voice of the next sign;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>and it shall come to pass if they will not believe even these two signs nor hearken to thy voice, then shalt thou take of the water of the river, and pour it out on the dry land,so shall the water which thou hast taken from the river, become, yea it shall become, blood, on the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>And Moses said unto YahwehPardon, O My Lord! not a man of words, am I, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant,for heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>Then Yahweh said unto himWho appointed a mouth for man, or who appointeth him to be dumb, or deaf, or seeing or blind? Is it not I, Yahweh,?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>Now, therefore go,and, I, will be with thy mouth, so will I direct thee, what thou shalt speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>And he saidPardon, O My Lord! send, I pray thee by the hand of him whom thou wilt send</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>Then was kindled the anger of Yahweh against Moses, and he saidIs there not Aaron, thy brother, the Levite? I know that he lean speak. Moreover also lo! he himself is coming forth to meet thee, as surely as he seeth thee, so surely will he rejoice in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>Then shalt thou speak unto him, and shalt put the words in his mouth,and, I, will be with thy mouth and with his mouth, so will I direct you what ye shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>And, he, shall speak for thee unto the people,so shall it come to pass that he shall become thy mouth, and thou shalt become to him as God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>And this staff, take thou in thy hand,wherewith thou shalt do the signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>So Moses went and returned unto Jethro his father-in-law and said to himLet me go, I pray thee, and return unto my brethren who are in Egypt, that I my see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses: Go and prosper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>Then said Yahweh unto Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt,for all the men are dead who were seeking thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>So Moses took his wife and his sons, and caused them to ride upon the ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt,and Moses took the staff of God in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>And Yahweh said unto Moses, When thou goest to return to Egypt, see as touching all the wonders which I have put in thy hand, that thou do them before Pharaohbut, I, will let his heart wax bold, and he will not suffer the people to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>Then shalt thou say unto Pharaoh, Thus, saith YahwehMy sonmy firstborn, is Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>Therefore I say unto thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me, But if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I, am going to slay, thy son, thy firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And it came to pass, on the way, in the resting-place for the night, that Yahweh fell upon him, and sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>So Zipporah took a sharp stone and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it down at his feet,and saidSurely, a bridegroom by rites of blood, art thou to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>So he let him go, Then, it was that she said, A bridegroom by rites of bloodwith regard to the rites of circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And Yahweh said unto Aaron, Go thy way to meet Moses, towards the desert. So he went his way, and fell in with him in the mountain of God and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>And Moses told Aaron, all the words of Yahweh wherewith he had sent him,and all the signs wherewith he had charged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>So Moses and Aaron went their way,and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>And Aaron spake all the words which Yahweh had spoken unto Moses,and did the signs before the eyes of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>And the people believed,and when they heard that Yahweh had concerned himself for the sons of Israel, and that he had looked upon their humiliation, then bent they their heads and bowed themselves down.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>And afterwards, Moses and Aaron went in and said unto Pharaoh,Thus, saith Yahweh God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a festival to me in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>Then said Pharaoh, Who is Yahweh that I should hearken to his voice, to let Israel go? I know not Yahweh, and certainly. Israel, will I not let go!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>And they said, the God of the Hebrews, hath met with us,let us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the desert and sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence or with sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>And the king of Egypt said unto them, Wherefore O Moses and Aaron should ye loose the people from their works? Get you to your burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And Pharaoh said, Lo! manynow, are the people of the land,and are ye to make them rest from their burdens?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>So then Pharaoh gave command on that day, unto the taskmasters over the people and unto their overseerssaying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>Ye shall no more give straw unto the people, for making the bricks as heretofore: Let them, go, themselves, so shall they gather for themselves straw:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>Nevertheless, the fixed number of bricks, which they have been making heretofore, shall ye lay upon them, ye shall not diminish therefrom,for idle, they are, on this account, it is that they are making an outcry, saying, We must go our way, we must sacrifice to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>The service must be made heavy on the men that they may labour on it,and let them not pay regard to words of falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>Then went forth the taskmasters of the people and their overseers, and spake unto the people,saying,Thus, saith Pharaoh, I am not going to give you straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>Ye yourselves go fetch you straw, of any ye can find,yet hath there not been diminished from your service a single thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>So the people dispersed themselves throughout all the land of Egypt,to gather stubble for straw:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>the taskmasters, meanwhile, being urgent saying,Complete your works, The task of a day, in its day, as when the straw was provided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>Then were beaten the overseers of the sons of Israel, whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh had set over them saying: Wherefore have ye not completed your task for making bricks, as heretofore, so also, yesterday and, to-day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>Then came in the overseers of the sons of Israel, and made outcry unto Pharaoh, saying, Wherefore shouldst thou do thus to thy servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>No straw, is given to thy servants, yet bricks,they keep saying to usmake ye! And lo, thy servants, are beatenthou dost, therefore, wrong thy people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.32.20'>Then took he the calf which they had made and burned it in the fire, and ground it till it became powder, and strewed it on the face of the waters, and made the sons of Israel drink.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.40.12'>And thou shalt bring near Aaron and his sons, unto the opening of the teat of meeting,and shalt bathe them in the water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.13'>and thou shalt clothe Aaron with the holy garments,and shalt anoint him and hallow him so shall he minister as priest unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.14'>His sons also, shalt thou bring near,and shalt clothe them with tunics;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.15'>and shalt anoint them as thou didst anoint their father, and they shall minister as priests unto me,so shall their anointing remain to them for an age-abiding priesthood, to their generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.16'>And Moses did,according to all that Yahweh had commanded him, so did he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.17'>Thus came it to pass, in the first month, in the second year, on the first of the month, that the habitation was reared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.18'>Yea Moses reared the habitation, and placed its sockets, and fixed its boards, and fastened its bars,and reared its pillar</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.19'>Then spread he abroad the tent upon the habitation, and put the covering of the tent upon it, above,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.20'>And he took and placed the testimony within the ark, and put the staves upon the ark,and placed the propitiatory upon the ark, above;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.21'>and brought in the ark into the habitation, and put up the screening veil, and screened over the ark of the testimony,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.22'>And he placed the table in the tent of meeting,on the side of the habitation northward,outside the veil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.23'>and set in order thereupon the arrangement of bread before Yahweh,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.24'>And he put the lampstand, in the tent of meeting, over against the table,on the side of the habitation southward;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.25'>and mounted the lamps before Yahweh,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.26'>And he put the altar of gold in the tent of meeting,before the veil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.27'>and burned thereupon the fragrant incense,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.28'>And he put up the screen of the entrance pertaining to the habitation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.29'>and, the altar of ascending-sacrifice, put he at the entrance of the habitation of the tent of meeting,and he caused to ascend thereupon the ascending-sacrifice, and the meal-offering,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.30'>And he put the laver, between the tent of meeting, and the altar,and put therein water for bathing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.31'>and Moses and Aaron and his sons thenceforth bathed thereat,their hands and their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.32'>when they were entering into the tent of meeting, and when they were drawing near unto the altar, then used they to bathe,As Yahweh commanded Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.33'>And he reared the court round about to the habitation and to the altar, and put up the screen of the gate of the court,and Moses finished the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.34'>Then did the cloud cover the tent of meeting,and, the glory of Yahweh, filled the habitation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.35'>and Moses was not able to enter into the tent of meeting, because the cloud had made its habitation thereupon,and the glory of Yahweh, filled the habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.36'>And whensoever the cloud ascended from off the habitation, then did the sons of Israel set forward, in all their journeyings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.37'>but if the cloud did not ascend, then did they not set forwarduntil the day when it did ascend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.40.38'>For, the cloud of Yahweh, was upon the habitation by day, and, a fire, came to be by night therein,in the sight of all the house of Israel in all their journeyings.</verse>
