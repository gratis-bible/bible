        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw, concerning Judah and Jerusalem,in the days of Uzziah Jotham Ahaz Hezekiahkings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear O heavens, And give ear, O earth, for Yahweh, hath spoken:Sons, have I brought up, and advanced, And, they, have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>An ox knoweth, his owner, And an ass his masters crib,Israel, doth not know, My people doth not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Alas! a nationcommitting sin, a peopleburdened with iniquity, a seedpractising wickedness, sonsacting corruptly. They have forsaken Yahweh despised the Holy One of Israel,Are estranged and gone back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why should ye be smitten any more? Ye would again turn aside! The whole head is sick, And the whole heart faint:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even unto the head, there is in it no soundness, Bruise and stripe and newly-made wound,They have not been pressed out, nor bound up, nor soothed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your countryis a desolation, Your citiesare consumed with fire,Your soilright before your eyes, foreigners are devouring it, And it is a desolation a very overthrow by foreigners;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And left is the Daughter of Zion, Like a hut in a vineyard,Like a lodge in a gourd-plot Like a city besieged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>If, Yahweh of hosts, had not left us a very small remnant, Like Sodom, had we become, Gomorrah, had we resembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of Yahweh, ye rulers of Sodom,Give ear to the instruction of our God, ye people of Gomorrah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>Of what use to me, is your multitude of sacrifices: Saith Yahweh: I am sated with ascending-offerings of rams and the fat of fed beasts,In the blood of bulls and young rams and he-goats, have I no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When ye enter to see my face, Who hath required this at your hand trampling my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Ye shall not again bring in an empty, present, Incense, an abomination, is that unto me! New moon, and sabbath calling an assemblyI cannot endure, iniquity and sacred festival!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts, my soul, hateth,They have become unto me a burden I am too weary to bear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>Even when ye spread forth your open palms, I hide mine eyes from you; Yea, though ye multiply prayers, I am not hearkening,Your hands, with deeds of blood, are filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash you make you clean, Put away the wickedness of your doings from before mine eyes,Cease to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do wellSeek justice, Correct the oppressor,Vindicate the fatherless, Plead the cause of the widow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come, I pray you, and let us settle the disputer Saith Yahweh,Though your sins be found like scarlet, As snow, shall they be made white, Though they appear red like crimson, As wool, shall they become.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Thy silver, hath become dross,Thy wine, weakened with water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Thy rulers, are unruly, and companions of thieves, Every one of the people, loveth a bribe, and runneth after rewards,The fatherless, they do not vindicate, And, the plea of the widow, reacheth them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore, Declareth the Lord Yahweh of hosts, The Mighty One of Israel,Alas! I must appease me on mine adversaries, I must avenge me on mine enemies</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>That I may turn my hand against thee, And smelt away, as with potash, thy dross, And remove all thine alloy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>That I may restore thy Judges as at the first, and thy Counsellors as at the beginning,After that, shalt thou he called Righteous citadel, Trusty city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion, with justice shall be redeemed,And her returning ones, with righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>And the downfall of transgressors and sinners, shall be, together,And, they who forsake Yahweh, shall be brought to an end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall turn pale on account of the oaks which ye desired,And ye shall blush on account of the gardens which ye had chosen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For ye shall be as an oak with its leaf faded, And as a garden that hath no, water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>Then shall the strong one become tow, And his work a spark,And they shall both blaze together And there be none to quench the fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he will judge between the nations, And be umpire to many peoples,And they will beat their swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-hooks, Nationagainst nation, shall not lift up sword, Neither shall they learn any more to make war,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob! come ye and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>Therefore hast thou abandoned thy people the house of Jacob, Because they have become full of the And use hidden arts like the Philistines,And with the children of foreigners, strike hands;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>And filled is their land with idols,To the work of their own hands, do they bow themselves down, To that which they made with their own fingers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>So the mean man boweth down And the great man stoopeth low,Therefore do not thou forgive them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, Or hide thee in the dust,Because of the terribleness of Yahweh, And for his majestic splendour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of mean men, shall be humbled, And, the haughtiness of great men, shall be bowed down,And Yahweh alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For, a day of Yahweh of hosts,   Upon every one who is high and lofty,And upon every one who is lifted up, And he shall be brought low;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>And upon all cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up,And upon all the oaks of Bashan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>And upon all the lofty mountains,And upon all the uplifted hills;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>And upon every high tower,And upon every fortress wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>And upon all the ships of Tarshish,And upon all desirable banners.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Let me sing, I pray you, for a well-beloved of mine, The song of my beloved concerning his vineyard:A vineyard, had my well-beloved on a very fruitful hill;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And he thoroughly digged it, And gathered out the stones thereof, And planted it with a precious vine, And built a tower in the midst thereof, Moreover also a wine-press, hewed he therein,Then waited he that it should bring forth grapes. And it brought forth wild grapes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>Now, therefore, O inhabitant of Jerusalem, And men of Judah,Judge, I pray you, betwixt me, and my vineyard:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What could have been done further to my vineyard, That I had not done in it? Why thenWhen I had waited that it should bring forth grapes, Brought it forth, wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>Now, therefore, I pray you, let me tell, you, what I am about to do to my vineyard,To take away the fence thereof And it shall be eaten up, To destroy the wall thereof And it shall be trodden down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>And I will make it a waste;It shall be neither pruned nor hoed, But there shall come up briars and thorns,And upon the clouds, will I lay a charge, That they rain thereon no rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>Surely the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts, is the house of Israel, And, the men of Judah, are the plantation in which he dearly delighted,And he waited, For equity but lo! murderous iniquity, For the rule of right but lo the cry of the wronged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Alas for them who join house to house, Field to field, bring they near,Until there is no room, But ye are left to dwell alone in the midst of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In mine ears,   Yahweh of hosts,Verily, houses in abundance, shall become, a desolation, Large and fair, without inhabitant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>For, ten yokes of vineyard, shall yield one bath,And the seed of a homer, shall yield an ephah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Alas, for them who rise early in the morning that strong drink, they may pursue,Who follow on in the evening cool   with wine, they are heated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And it cometh to passthat lyre and harp, timbrel and flute and wine are in their banquets,But, the doing of Yahweh, they do not discern, And the work of his hands, have they not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore, are my people taken away captive before they know it,And their honourable mean are famished with hunger, And, their multitude, do gape for thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore, hath hades enlarged her desire, And opened her mouth to its widest,And their glory, and their multitude and their pomp. and he that is uproarious shall descend thereinto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And the mean man hath been bowed down And the mighty man hath been humbled,Yea the looks of the haughty shall be humbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>But Yahweh of hosts, hath been exalted, in justice,And the GOD that is holy hath been hallowed in righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the young rams feed where they please,And, the wastes of the wealthy, shall strangers consume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Alas! for them Who draw on themselves punishment with cords of falsehood,And as with waggon-bands, penalty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>Who sayLet his work quickenlet it hasten, That we may see,And let the purpose of Israels Holy One, draw near and come. That we may know!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Alas! for them Who call evil good and good evil,Who put darkness for light and light for darkness, Who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Alas for them Who are wise in their own eyes,And in their own sight, are prudent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Alas for them Who are heroes to drink wine,And men of valour to mingle strong drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>Who justify the lawless, for a bribe,Whereas the righteousness of the righteous, they take from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore, As a tongue of fire, eateth up straw, And a flame reduceth, dry grass, to powder, Their root, like rottenness, shall become, And their blossom, like dust shall ascend,Because they refused the law of Yahweh of hosts, And the utterance of the Holy One of Israel, they despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>For this cause, did the anger of Yahweh kindle upon his own people, And he stretched out his hand against them and smote themSo that the mountains, trembled, And, their dead bodies, served, for fuel in the midst of the streets. For all this, hath his anger, not turned back, But still, is his hand outstretched,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>Therefore will he lift up an ensign to the nations afar off, And signal for him from the end of the earth,And lo! with hot haste, will he come:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary, and none shall stumble in his midst, He shall neither slumber nor sleep,Nor shall be loosened, the girdle of his loins, Nor snapped, the thong of his sandals:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>Whose arrows, are sharpened, and all his bows, bent,The hoofs of his horses, like flint, are accounted, And, his wheels,   like a storm-wind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>A roar, hath he, like a lioness,He will roar like wild lionsAnd will growl, and lay hold on prey, and carry into safety, and there be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>Yea he will growl at him in that day, like the growling of the sea,Though he look hard for the land, lo! the darkness of distress, Yea the light, hath grown dark in its clouds!</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw My Lord, sitting upon a throne high and lifted up, and, his skirts, did fill the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Seraphim, were standing above him; six wings severally, had each one,With twain, he covered his face And with twain, he covered his feet And with twain, he did fly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then flew unto me one of the seraphim, And in his hand, a live coal,With tongs, had he taken it from off the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>Then touched he my month, and saidLo! this hath touched thy lips,Thus shall be taken away, thine iniquity, And, thy sin, by propitiation be covered.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'>Thus, saith Yahweh, The, heavens, are my throne, and The earth, is my footstool: Where then is the house which ye can build me? Or where is my place of rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'>For, all these things, hath mine own hand made, And all these things came into being,Declareth Yahweh. But for this one, will I look around, For him who is humbled and smitten in spirit, And so careth anxiously for my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>He that slaughtereth an ox,   who blesseth iniquity: They indeed, have chosen their own ways, And in their own abominations, their soul hath found delight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>I, also, will choose the things that vex them. And the things they dread, will I bring upon them, BecauseI called and there was none to answer, I spake, and they hearkened not,But did that which was wicked in mine eyes, And of that wherein I delighted not, made choice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the word of Yahweh, ye who care anxiously for his word: Said your brethren Who hated you. Who thrust you out for my Names sake, Yahweh be glorified! Therefore shall he appear to your rejoicing, But, they, shall turn pale.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>Before she travaileth, she hath brought forth,Before her pains come to her, she hath given birth to a man-child!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>Who hath heard the like of this? Who hath seen the like of these things? Can a land, be made to bring forth in one day? Or a nation, be born, at one time? As soon as she travaileth, Zion hath also given birth to her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'>Could, I, bring to the birth and not cause to bring forth? saith Yahweh. Or, I, be causing to bring forth and then prevent? Saith thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and exult over her All ye who love her,Joy with her right joyfully, All ye who used to mourn over her:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'>That ye may draw to satisfaction out of the fountain a of her consolations,That ye may drain out and get exquisite delight from the abundance of her glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>For, thus, saith Yahweh,Behold me! extending unto her like a river, prosperity, And as a torrent oerflowing, the glory of the nations. That ye may draw it forthUpon the side, shall ye be carried, and Upon the knees, shall ye be caressed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>As one whom, his mother, consoleth, So, will, I, console you, And in Jerusalem, shall ye be consoled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>As soon as ye have seen it, your heart, shall be joyful, And your bones, like green herbage, shall thrive,So shall be known The hand of Yahweh with his servants, But indignation with his foes!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>For lo! Yahweh, with fire, doth come, And like a storm-wind,   his chariots,To render with fury, his anger, And his rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'>For, by fire, will Yahweh enter into judgment, And by his sword, with all flesh,And many shall be the slain of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>They who hallow themselves and purify themselves for the gardens, Behind a certain thing in the midst, Who eat the flesh of swine and the abomination, and the mouse, Together, shall be cut offDeclareth Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>Because, I, for their works and their devices, doth it come! Am about to gather together all nations and tongues,So shall they come and see my glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>Then will I set among them, a sign, And will send, of them such as have escaped unto the nationsTarshish Pul and Lud that draw the bow, Tubal and Javan,The Coastlands that are afar off, Who have not heard my fame Nor seen my glory, And they shall tell my glory throughout the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>Then shall they bring in all your brethren out of all the nations, As a present unto Yahweh, Upon horses and in chariots and in palanquins and on mules and on dromedaries Unto my holy mountainJerusalem, saith Yahweh,Just as the sons of Israel, bring in their present in a pure vessel, into the house, of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>And of them also, will I take for priestsfor Levites, saith Yahweh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>For, as the new heavens and the new earth, which I am about to make, are to remain before me, Declareth Yahweh, So, shall remain your seed and your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'>And it shall come to pass, that From one new moon to another, and From one sabbath to another, Shall all flesh, come in, to bow down before me, Saith Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'>Then shall they go forth and look upon the dead bodies of the men who had been trespassing against meFor, their worm, shall not die, And, their fire, shall not be quenched; So shall they become an abhorrence to all flesh.</verse>
