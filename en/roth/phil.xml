      <chapter osisID='Phil.1'>
        <title>Nevertheless, ye also, do ye, individually, each man be so loving, his own wife, as himself, and, the wife,</title>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.1'>Paul and Timothy, servants of Jesus Christ,unto all the saints in Christ Jesus who are in Philippi, with overseers and ministers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.2'>Favour unto you, and peace, from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I am giving thanks unto my God, on occasion of all my remembrance of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.4'>At all times, in every supplication of mine, in behalf of you all, with joy, my supplication, making,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>On account of your contribution unto the glad-message, from the first day until the present:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>Being persuaded of this very thingthat, he who hath begun in you a good work, will perfect it, until the day of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>According as it is right in me to have this regard in behalf of you all,because ye have had me in your hearts, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the glad-message, all of you being, joint partakers of my favour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is, my witness, how I long for you all in the tender affections of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>And, this, I praythat, your love, may be, yet more and more, pre-eminent in personal knowledge and all perception,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.10'>To the end ye may be putting to the test the things that differ, in order that ye may be incorrupt and may give no occasion of stumbling, unto the day of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>Filled with that fruit of righteousness which is through Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>Howbeit, I am minded, brethren, that ye should be, getting to know, that, the things which relate unto myself, rather, unto an advancement of the glad-message, have fallen out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.13'>So that, my bonds, have become manifest in Christ, in the whole palace, and unto all the rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>And   , the most of the brethren in the Lord, assured by my bonds, are becoming more abundantly bold to be fearlessly speaking the word of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.15'>Some, indeed, by reason of envy and strifesome, however, by reason of good willare proclaiming, the Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.16'>These, indeed, out of love, knowing that, for the defence of the glad-message, I am set;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.17'>But, those, out of faction, are declaring, the Christ, not purelysupposing to rouse up, tribulation, with my bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.18'>What then? That, in any way, whether in pretext, or in truth, Christ, is declared, and, in this, I rejoiceyea, and will rejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.19'>For I know that, this, shall turn unto me for salvationthrough your supplication, and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.20'>According to my eager outlook and hope, that, in nothing, shall I be put to shame, but, with all freedom of speech, as always, now also, shall Christ be magnified in my body, whether through means of life, or of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.21'>For, unto meliving, is Christ, and, dying, gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.22'>But, if living in flesh,   , this, unto me, is a fruit of work,and, what I shall choose, I make not known:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.23'>I am held in constraint, however, by reason of the two,having, the coveting, to be released, and to be with, Christ, for it were far better!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.24'>But, to abide still in the flesh, is more needful for your sake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.25'>And, of, this, being assured, know that I shall abide,yea abide with you all, for your advancement, and the joy of your faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.26'>In order that, your matter of boasting, may be more abundant in Christ Jesus, regarding me, through my own presence again with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.27'>Only, in a manner worthy of the glad-message of the Christ, be using your citizenship; in order thatwhether coming and seeing you, or being absent, I may hear of the things which concern youthat ye are standing fast in one spirit, with one soul, joining for the combat along with the faith of the glad-message;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.28'>And not being affrighted in anything by the opposers,the which, is, unto them, a token of destruction, although of your salvation, and this from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.29'>Because, unto you, hath it been given as a favour, in behalf of Christ, not only, on him, to believe, but also, in his behalf, to suffer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.30'>Having, the same contest, which ye have seen in me, and now hear to be in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.2'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.1'>If there be, therefore, any encouragement in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tender affections and compassions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.2'>Fill ye up my joythat, the same thing, ye esteem, the same love, possessing, joined in soul, the one thing, esteeming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.3'>Nothing by way of faction, nothing by way of vain-glory,but, in lowliness of mind, accounting, one another, superior to yourselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.4'>Not, to your own things, severally looking, but, to the things of others, severally:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>The same thing, esteem, in yourselves, which also, in Christ Jesus,   ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>Who, in form of God, subsisting, not, a thing to be seized, accounted the being equal with God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>But, himself, emptied, taking, a servants form, coming to be, in mens likeness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>And, in fashion, being found, as a man, humbled himself, becoming obedient as far as death, yea, death upon a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Wherefore also, God, uplifted him far on high, and favoured him with the name which is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>In order that, in the name of Jesus, every knee might bowof beings in heaven, and on earth, and underground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.11'>And, every tongue, might openly confessthat Jesus Christ is, Lord, unto the glory of God the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.12'>So, then, my belovedeven as ye have always obeyed, not  as  in my presence only, but, now, much more, in my absence, with fear and trembling, your own salvation, be working out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>For it is, God, who energiseth within you, both the desiring and the energising, in behalf of his good pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>All things, be doing, apart from murmurings and disputings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>In order that ye may become faultless and inviolate, children of God, blameless amidst a crooked and perverted generation, amongst whom ye appear as luminaries in the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.16'>A word of light, holding forth,as a matter of boasting unto me, for the day of Christ,that, not in vain, I ran, nor, in vain, I toiled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>Nay! if I am even to be poured out as a drink-offering, upon the sacrifice and public ministry of your faith, I rejoice, yea rejoice together with you all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>For the same cause, moreover, do, ye also, rejoice, yea rejoice together with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>I am hoping, however, in the Lord JesusTimothy, shortly, to send unto you, in order that, I also, may be of cheerful soul, when I have ascertained the things that concern you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For, no one, have I, of equal soul, who, genuinely, as to the things that concern you, will be anxious;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For, they all, their own things, do seek, not the things of Christ Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But, of the proof of him, be taking note,that, as child, with father, with me, hath he done service for the glad-message;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.23'>Him, indeed, therefore, am I hoping to sendas soon as I can look off from the things that concern myself,forthwith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>I am assured, however, in the Lord,that I, myself, shall shortly come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Needful, nevertheless have I accounted itEpaphroditus, my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your apostle and public minister to my need, to send unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>Since he hath been longing to see, you all, and hath been in great distress, because ye had heard he was sick;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>And, in fact, he was sick, nigh unto death; but, God, had mercy on him,and, not on him only, but, on me also, lest, sorrow upon sorrow, I should have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>The more promptly, therefore, have I sent him, that, seeing him again, ye may rejoice, and, I, the less sorrowful, may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Be giving him welcome, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy; and, such as he, in honour, be holding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>Because, for the sake of the work of the Lord, unto death, he drew nigh, running hazard with his life, that he might fill up your lack of the public service, towards me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.3'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>For the rest, my brethrenrejoice in the Lord. To be writing, the same things, unto you, to me, is not irksome, while, for you, is safe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs, beware of mischievous workers, beware of the mutilation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For, we, are the circumcision, who in the Spirit of God, are doing divine service, and are boasting in Christ Jesus, and, not in flesh, having confidence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>Although, indeed, I, might have confidence even in flesh. If any other thinketh to have confidence in flesh, I, more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.5'>Circumcised, the eighth day, of the race of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews,regarding law, a Pharisee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>Regarding zeal, persecuting the assembly, regarding the righteousness that is in law, having become blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But, whatever things, unto me, were gain, the same, have I accounted, for the Christs sake, loss;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>Yea, doubtless! and I account all things to be, loss, because of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for the sake of whom, the loss, of all things, have I suffered, and do account them refuse, in order that, Christ, I may win,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>And be found in himnot having a righteousness of my own, that which is by law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is, of God, upon my faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>To get to know him, and the power of his resurrection and fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>If by any means I may advance to the earlier resurrection, which is from among the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have, already, received, or have, already, reached perfection, but I am pressing onif I may even lay hold of that for which I have also been laid hold of by Christ  Jesus :</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brethren! I, as to myself, reckon that I have, not yet, laid hold; one thing, however,the things behind, forgetting, and, unto the things before, eagerly reaching out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>With the goal in view, I press on for the prize of the upward calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>As many, therefore, as are full-grown, let, this, be our resolve; and, if, somewhat differently, ye are resolved, this, also, shall, God, unto you reveal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, whereunto we have advanced, in the same rank, stepping along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Imitators together of me, become ye, brethren, and keep an eye on them who, thus, are walking,even as ye have, us, for, an ensample.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For, many, are walkingof whom I have often been telling you, and, now, even weeping, am telling,the enemies of the cross of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>Whose, end, is destruction, whose, God, is the belly, and   , glory, is in their shame, who, upon the earthly things, are resolved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For, our citizenship, in the heavens, hath its rise; wherefore, a Saviour also, do we ardently await,The Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>Who will transfigure our humbled body, into conformity with his glorified body, according to the energy wherewith he is able even to subdue, unto himself, all things.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Phil.4'>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.1'>So then, my brethren, beloved and longed for, my joy and crown,thus, stand fast in the Lord, beloved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.2'>Euodia, I exhort, and, Syntche, I exhort,on the same thing, to be resolved in the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.3'>Yea! I request thee also, true yokefellow, be thou helping together with these women,who, indeed, in the joyful message, have maintained the combat with me, along with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names, are in the book of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.4'>Rejoice in the Lord always: again, I will sayrejoice!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.5'>Let, your considerateness, be known unto all men. The Lord, is near:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.6'>For nothing, be anxious, but, in everything, by your prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let, your petitions, be made known unto God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.7'>And, the peace of God, which riseth above every mind, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts, in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.8'>For the rest, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are dignified, whatsoever things are righteous, whatsoever things are chaste, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report,if there be any virtue, and if any praise, the same, be taking into account;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.9'>The things which ye have both learned, and accepted, and heard, and seen in me, the same, practise;and, the God of peace, shall be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.10'>Howbeit I have been made to rejoice in the Lord greatlythat, now, at length, ye have flourished in your care for me,although, indeed, ye were caring, but lacked opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that, as to coming short, I am speaking, for, I, have learned, in whatsoever circumstances I am, to be, independent:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know   to have more than enough,in every way, and in all things, have I been let into the secretboth to be well fed, and to be hungering, both to have more than enough, and to be coming short:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.13'>I have might, for all things, in him that empowereth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.14'>Nevertheless, nobly, have ye done, in taking fellowship with me in my tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Ye know, moreover, even ye, Philippians,that, in the beginning of the glad-message, when I went forth from Macedonia, not, so much as one assembly, with me had fellowshipin the matter of giving and receivingsave, ye alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>That, even in Thessalonica, both once and again, unto my need, ye sent:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek after the gift, but I seek after the fruit that is to abound unto your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>But I have all things in full, and have more than enough, I am filled, having welcomed from Epaphroditus the things that came from you,a fragrance of sweet smell, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And, my God, will fill up your every need, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.20'>Now, unto our God and Father, be the gloryunto the ages of ages. Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.21'>Salute ye every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren who are with me, salute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.22'>All the saints salute you, but especially they who are of Caesars household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.23'>The favour of our Lord Jesus Christ, be with your spirit.</verse>
