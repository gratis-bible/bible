So David sent his servants, to give him words of comfort on account of his father. And David's servants came into the land of the children of Ammon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>But the chiefs of the children of Ammon said to Hanun their lord, Does it seem to you that David is honouring your father by sending comforters to you? has he not sent his servants to go through the town and make secret observation of it, and overcome it?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>So Hanun took David's servants, and after cutting off half the hair on their chins, and cutting off the skirts of their robes up to the middle, he sent them away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When David had news of it, he sent men out with the purpose of meeting them on their way, for the men were greatly shamed: and the king said, Go to Jericho till your hair is long again, and then come back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made themselves hated by David, they sent to the Aramaeans of Beth-rehob and Zobah, and got for payment twenty thousand footmen, and they got from the king of Maacah a thousand men, and from Tob twelve thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And hearing of this, David sent Joab and all the army and the best fighting-men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And the children of Ammon came out and put their forces in position at the way into the town: and the Aramaeans of Zobah and of Rehob, with the men of Tob and Maacah, were by themselves in the field.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Now when Joab saw that their forces were in position against him in front and at his back, he took the best of the men of Israel and put them in line against the Aramaeans;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the rest of the people he put in position against the children of Ammon, with Abishai, his brother, at their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he said, If the Aramaeans are stronger and get the better of me, then you are to come to my help; but if the children of Ammon get the better of you, I will come to your help.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Take heart, and let us be strong for our people and for the towns of our God, and may the Lord do what seems good to him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Then Joab and the people with him went forward to the fight against the Aramaeans, and they went in flight before him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when the children of Ammon saw the flight of the Aramaeans, they themselves went in flight from Abishai, and came into the town. So Joab went back from fighting the children of Ammon and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when the Aramaeans saw that Israel had overcome them, they got themselves together.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And Hadadezer sent for the Aramaeans who were on the other side of the River: and they came to Helam, with Shobach, the captain of Hadadezer's army, at their head.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And word of this was given to David: and he got all Israel together and went over Jordan and came to Helam. And the Aramaeans put their forces in position against David, and made an attack on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the Aramaeans went in flight before Israel; and David put to the sword the men of seven hundred Aramaean war-carriages and forty thousand footmen, and Shobach, the captain of the army, was wounded, and came to his death there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And when all the kings who were servants of Hadadezer saw that they were overcome by Israel, they made peace with Israel and became their servants. So the Aramaeans, in fear, gave no more help to the children of Ammon.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
