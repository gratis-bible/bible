      <chapter osisID='Ezra.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>Now in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, in order that the word of the Lord given by the mouth of Jeremiah might come true, the spirit of Cyrus, king of Persia, was moved by the Lord, so that he made a public statement through all his kingdom, and put it in writing, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>These are the words of Cyrus, king of Persia: The Lord God of heaven has given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he has made me responsible for building a house for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Whoever there is among you of his people, may his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and take in hand the building of the house of the Lord, the God of Israel; he is the God who is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.4'>And whoever there may be of the rest of Israel, living in any place, let the men of that place give him help with offerings of silver and gold and goods and beasts, in addition to the offering freely given for the house of God in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then the heads of families of Judah and Benjamin, with the priests and the Levites, got ready, even all those whose spirits were moved by God to go up and take in hand the building of the Lord's house in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.6'>And all their neighbours gave them help with offerings of vessels of silver and gold and goods and beasts and things of great value, in addition to what was freely offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>And Cyrus the king got out the vessels of the house of the Lord which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and put in the house of his gods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>Even these Cyrus made Mithredath, the keeper of his wealth, get out, and he gave them, after numbering them, to Sheshbazzar, the ruler of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this is the number of them: there were thirty gold plates, a thousand silver plates, twenty-nine knives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>Thirty gold basins, four hundred and ten silver basins, and a thousand other vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.11'>There were five thousand, four hundred gold and silver vessels. All these were taken back by Sheshbazzar, when those who had been taken prisoner went up from Babylon to Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.2.70'>So the priests and the Levites and the people and the music-makers and the door-keepers and the Nethinim, took up their places in their towns; even all Israel in their towns.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.1'>And when the seventh month came, and the children of Israel were in the towns, the people came together like one man to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.2'>Then Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and his brothers the priests, and Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, with his brothers, got up and made the altar of the God of Israel for burned offerings as is recorded in the law of Moses, the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>They put the altar on its base; for fear was on them because of the people of the countries: and they made burned offerings on it to the Lord, even burned offerings morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they kept the feast of tents, as it is recorded, making the regular burned offerings every day by number, as it is ordered; for every day what was needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.5'>And after that, the regular burned offering and the offerings for the new moons and all the fixed feasts of the Lord which had been made holy, and the offering of everyone who freely gave his offering to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they made a start with the burned offerings, but the base of the Temple of the Lord had still not been put in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>And they gave money to the stoneworkers and woodworkers; and meat and drink and oil to the people of Zidon and of Tyre, for the transport of cedar-trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, as Cyrus, king of Persia, had given them authority to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now in the second year of their coming into the house of God in Jerusalem, in the second month, the work was taken in hand by Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those who had come from the land where they were prisoners to Jerusalem: and they made the Levites, of twenty years old and over, responsible for overseeing the work of the house of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.9'>Then Jeshua with his sons and his brothers, Kadmiel with his sons, the sons of Hodaviah, together took up the work of overseeing the workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad with their sons and their brothers, the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.10'>And when the builders put in position the base of the Temple of the Lord, the priests, dressed in their robes, took their places with horns, and the Levites, the sons of Asaph, with brass instruments, to give praise to the Lord in the way ordered by David, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they gave praise to the Lord, answering one another in their songs and saying, For he is good, for his mercy to Israel is eternal. And all the people gave a great cry of joy, when they gave praise to the Lord, because the base of the Lord's house was put in place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But a number of the priests and Levites and the heads of families, old men who had seen the first house, when the base of this house was put down before their eyes, were overcome with weeping; and a number were crying out with joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>So that in the ears of the people the cry of joy was mixed with the sound of weeping; for the cries of the people were loud and came to the ears of those who were a long way off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now news came to the haters of Judah and Benjamin that the people who had come back were building a Temple to the Lord, the God of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>Then they came to Zerubbabel and to the heads of families, and said to them, Let us take part in the building with you; for we are servants of your God, even as you are; and we have been making offerings to him from the days of Esar-haddon, king of Assyria, who put us here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel and Jeshua and the rest of the heads of families in Israel said to them, You have no part with us in the building of a house for our God; we ourselves will do the work together for the Lord, the God of Israel, as Cyrus, king of Persia, has given us orders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land made the hands of the people of Judah feeble, troubling them with fear in their building;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>And they gave payment to men who made designs against them and kept them from effecting their purpose, all through the time of Cyrus, king of Persia, till Darius became king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the time of Ahasuerus, when he first became king, they put on record a statement against the people of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the time of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his friends, sent a letter to Artaxerxes, king of Persia, writing it in the Aramaean writing and language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe, sent a letter against Jerusalem, to Artaxerxes the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>The letter was sent by Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe and their friends; the Dinaites and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites, the Elamites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>And the rest of the nations which the great and noble Osnappar took over and put in Samaria and the rest of the country over the river:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This is a copy of the letter which they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Your servants living across the river send these words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>We give news to the king that the Jews who came from you have come to us at Jerusalem; they are building up again that uncontrolled and evil town; the walls are complete and they are joining up the bases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>The king may be certain that when the building of this town and its walls is complete, they will give no tax or payment in goods or forced payments, and in the end it will be a cause of loss to the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we are responsible to the king, and it is not right for us to see the king's honour damaged, we have sent to give the king word of these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>So that search may be made in the book of the records of your fathers: and you will see in the book of the records that this town has been uncontrolled, and a cause of trouble to kings and countries, and that there were outbursts against authority there in the past: for which reason the town was made waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We give you word, that if the building of this town and its walls is made complete, there will be an end of your power in the country across the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>Then the king sent an answer to Rehum, the chief ruler, and Shimshai the scribe, and their friends living in Samaria, and to the rest of those across the river, saying, Peace to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>And now the sense of the letter which you sent to us has been made clear to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I gave orders for a search to be made, and it is certain that in the past this town has made trouble for kings, and that outbursts against authority have taken place there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>Further, there have been great kings in Jerusalem, ruling over all the country across the river, to whom they gave taxes and payments in goods and forced payments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Give an order now, that these men are to do nothing more, and that the building of the town is to be stopped, till I give an order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>Be certain to do this with all care: do not let trouble be increased to the king's damage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Then, after reading the king's letter, Rehum and Shimshai the scribe and their friends went quickly to Jerusalem, to the Jews, and had them stopped by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>So the work of the house of God at Jerusalem came to an end; so it was stopped, till the second year of the rule of Darius, king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Now the prophets Haggai and Zechariah, the son of Iddo, were preaching to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua, the son of Jozadak, got up and made a start at building the house of God at Jerusalem: and the prophets of God were with them, helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time, Tattenai, ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai, and their men, came to them and said, Who gave you orders to go on building this house and this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then they said these words to them: What are the names of the men who are at work on this building?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was on the chiefs of the Jews, and they did not make them give up working till the question had been put before Darius and an answer had come by letter about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>This is a copy of the letter which Tattenai, the ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai and his friends the Apharsachites, living across the river, sent to Darius the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>They sent him a letter saying, To Darius the king, all peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>This is to give the king word that we went into the land of Judah, to the house of the great God, which is made of great stones, and has its walls supported with wood, and the work is going on with industry, and they are doing it well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then we said to the men responsible, who gave you authority for the building of this house and these walls?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>And we made request for their names, so that we might send you word, and give you the names of the men at the head of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And they made answer to us, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are building the house which was put up in times long past and was designed and made complete by a great king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But when the God of heaven was moved to wrath by our fathers, he gave them up into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, the Chaldaean, who sent destruction on this house and took the people away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>But in the first year of Cyrus, king of Babylon, Cyrus the king gave an order for the building of this house of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.14'>And the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple which was in Jerusalem, and put into the house of his god in Babylon, these Cyrus the king took from the house of his god in Babylon, and gave to one named Sheshbazzar, whom he had made ruler;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.15'>And he said to him, Go, take these vessels, and put them in the Temple in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be put up again in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.16'>Then this same Sheshbazzar came and put the house of God in Jerusalem on its bases: and from that time till now the building has been going on, but it is still not complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.17'>So now, if it seems good to the king, let search be made in the king's store-house at Babylon, to see if it is true that an order was given by Cyrus the king for the building of this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king send us word of his pleasure in connection with this business.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.1'>Then Darius the king gave an order and a search was made in the house of the records, where the things of value were stored up in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.2'>And at Achmetha, in the great house of the king in the land of Media, they came across a roll, in which this statement was put on record:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.3'>In the first year of Cyrus the king, Cyrus the king made an order: In connection with the house of God at Jerusalem, let the house be put up, the place where they make offerings, and let the earth for the bases be put in place; let it be sixty cubits high and sixty cubits wide;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.4'>With three lines of great stones and one line of new wood supports; and let the necessary money be given out of the king's store-house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.5'>And let the gold and silver vessels from the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took from the Temple at Jerusalem to Babylon, be given back and taken again to the Temple at Jerusalem, every one in its place, and put them in the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.6'>So now, Tattenai, ruler of the land across the river, and Shethar-bozenai and your people the Apharsachites across the river, keep far from that place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.7'>Let the work of this house of God go on; let the ruler of the Jews and their responsible men put up this house of God in its place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.8'>Further, I give orders as to what you are to do for the responsible men of the Jews in connection with the building of this house of God: that from the king's wealth, that is, from the taxes got together in the land over the river, the money needed is to be given to these men readily, so that their work may not be stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.9'>And whatever they have need of, young oxen and sheep and lambs, for burned offerings to the God of heaven, grain, salt, wine, and oil, whatever the priests in Jerusalem say is necessary, is to be given to them day by day regularly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.10'>So that they may make offerings of a sweet smell to the God of heaven, with prayers for the life of the king and of his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.11'>And I have given orders that if anyone makes any change in this word, one of the supports is to be pulled out of his house, and he is to be lifted up and fixed to it; and his house is to be made waste for this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.12'>And may the God who has made it a resting-place for his name send destruction on all kings and peoples whose hands are outstretched to make any change in this or to do damage to this house of God at Jerusalem. I, Darius, have given this order, let it be done with all care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.13'>Then Tattenai, the ruler across the river, and Shethar-bozenai and their people, because of the order given by King Darius, did as he had said with all care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.14'>And the responsible men of the Jews went on with their building, and did well, helped by the teaching of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah, the son of Iddo. They went on building till it was complete, in keeping with the word of the God of Israel, and the orders given by Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes, king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.15'>And the building of this house was complete on the third day of the month Adar, in the sixth year of the rule of Darius the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.16'>And the children of Israel, the priests and the Levites, and the rest of those who had come back, kept the feast of the opening of this house of God with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.17'>And they gave as offerings at the opening of this house of God a hundred oxen, two hundred sheep, four hundred lambs; and for a sin-offering for all Israel, twelve he-goats, being the number of the tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.18'>And they put the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their order, for the worship of God at Jerusalem; as it is recorded in the book of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.19'>And the children of Israel who had come back kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.20'>For the priests and the Levites had made themselves clean together; they were all clean: and they put the Passover lamb to death for all those who had come back, and for their brothers the priests and for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.21'>And the children of Israel, who had come back, and all those who were joined to them, after separating themselves from the evil ways of the people of the land to become the servants of the Lord, the God of Israel, took food together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.6.22'>And kept the feast of unleavened bread for seven days with joy: for the Lord had made them full of joy, by turning the heart of the king of Assyria to them to give them help in the work of the house of God, the God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.1'>Now after these things, when Artaxerxes was king of Persia, Ezra, the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son of Hilkiah,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.6'>This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a scribe, expert in the law of Moses which the Lord, the God of Israel, had given: and the king, moved by the Lord his God, gave him whatever he made request for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.7'>And some of the children of Israel went up, with some of the priests and the Levites and the music-makers and the door-keepers and the Nethinim, to Jerusalem, in the seventh year of Artaxerxes the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.8'>And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, in the seventh year of the king's rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.9'>For, starting his journey from Babylon on the first day of the first month, he came to Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, by the good help of his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.10'>For Ezra had given his mind to learning the law of the Lord and doing it, and to teaching his rules and decisions in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.11'>Now this is a copy of the letter which King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest and the scribe, who put into writing the words of the orders of the Lord, and of his rules for Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.12'>Artaxerxes, king of kings, to Ezra the priest, scribe of the law of the God of heaven, all peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.13'>And now it is my order that all those of the people of Israel, and their priests and Levites in my kingdom, who are ready and have a desire to go to Jerusalem, are to go with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.14'>Because you are sent by the king and his seven wise men, to get knowledge about Judah and Jerusalem, as you are ordered by the law of your God which is in your hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.15'>And to take with you the silver and gold freely offered by the king and his wise men to the God of Israel, whose Temple is in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.16'>As well as all the silver and gold which you get from the land of Babylon, together with the offering of the people and of the priests, freely given for the house of their God, which is in Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.17'>So with this money get with care oxen, sheep, and lambs, with their meal offerings and their drink offerings, to be offered on the altar of the house of your God, which is in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.18'>And whatever seems right to you and to your brothers to do with the rest of the silver and gold, that do, as may be pleasing to your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.19'>And the vessels which have been given to you for the uses of the house of your God, you are to give to the God of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.20'>And whatever more is needed for the house of your God, and which you may have to give, take it from the king's store-house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.21'>And I, even I, Artaxerxes the king, now give orders to all keepers of the king's money across the river, that whatever Ezra the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, may have need of from you, is to be done with all care,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.22'>Up to a hundred talents of silver, a hundred measures of grain, a hundred measures of wine, and a hundred measures of oil, and salt without measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.23'>Whatever is ordered by the God of heaven, let it be done completely for the house of the God of heaven; so that there may not be wrath against the kingdom of the king and his sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.24'>In addition, we make it clear to you, that it will be against the law to put any tax or payment in goods or forced payment on any of the priests or Levites, the music-makers, door-keepers, Nethinim, or any servants of this house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.25'>And you, Ezra, by the wisdom of your God which is in you, are to put rulers and judges to have authority over all the people across the river who have knowledge of the laws of your God; and you are to give teaching to him who has no knowledge of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.26'>And if anyone does not keep the law of your God and the law of the king, take care that punishment is given to him, by death or by driving him from his country or by taking away his goods or by putting him in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.27'>Praise be to the Lord, the God of our fathers, who has put such a thing into the heart of the king, to make fair the house of the Lord which is in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.7.28'>And has given mercy to me before the king and his government and before all the king's great captains. And I was made strong by the hand of the Lord my God which was on me, and I got together out of Israel chief men to go up with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.16'>Then I sent for Eliezer and Ariel and Shemaiah and Elnathan Jarib and Elnathan and Nathan and Zechariah and Meshullam, all responsible men; and for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.17'>And I sent them to Iddo the chief at the place Casiphia, and gave them orders what to say to Iddo and his brothers the Nethinim at the place Casiphia, so that they might come back to us with men to do the work of the house of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.18'>And by the help of our God they got for us Ish-sechel, one of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the son of Israel; and Sherebiah with his sons and brothers, eighteen;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.21'>Then I gave orders for a time of going without food, there by the river Ahava, so that we might make ourselves low before our God in prayer, requesting from him a straight way for us and for our little ones and for all our substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.22'>For I would not, for shame, make request to the king for a band of armed men and horsemen to give us help against those who might make attacks on us on the way: for we had said to the king, The hand of our God is on his servants for good, but his power and his wrath are against all those who are turned away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.23'>So we went without food, requesting our God for this: and his ear was open to our prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.24'>So I put on one side twelve of the chiefs of the priests, Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.25'>And gave to them by weight the silver and the gold and the vessels, all the offering for the house of our God which the king and his wise men and his captains and all Israel there present had given:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.26'>Measuring into their hands six hundred and fifty talents of silver, and silver vessels, a hundred talents' weight, and a hundred talents of gold,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.28'>And I said to them, You are holy to the Lord and the vessels are holy: and the silver and the gold are an offering freely given to the Lord, the God of your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.8.29'>Take care of them and keep them, till you put them on the scales before the chiefs of the priests and the Levites and the chiefs of the families of Israel, in Jerusalem, in the rooms of the house of the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.1'>Now after these things were done, the captains came to me and said, The people of Israel and the priests and Levites have not kept themselves separate from the people of the lands, but have taken part in the disgusting ways of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.2'>For they have taken their daughters for themselves and for their sons, so that the holy seed has been mixed with the peoples of the lands; and in fact the captains and rulers have been the first to do this evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.3'>And hearing this, with signs of grief and pulling out the hair of my head and my chin, I took my seat on the earth deeply troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.4'>Then everyone who went in fear of the words of the God of Israel, because of the sin of those who had come back, came together to me; and I kept where I was, overcome with grief, till the evening offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.5'>And at the evening offering, having made myself low before God, I got up, and with signs of grief, falling down on my knees, with my hands stretched out to the Lord my God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.6'>I said, O my God, shame keeps me from lifting up my face to you, my God: for our sins are increased higher than our heads and our evil-doing has come up to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.7'>From the days of our fathers till this day we have been great sinners; and for our sins, we and our kings and our priests have been given up into the hands of the kings of the lands, to the sword and to prison and to loss of goods and to shame of face, as it is this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.8'>And now for a little time grace has come to us from the Lord our God, to let a small band of us get free and to give us a nail in his holy place, so that our God may give light to our eyes and a measure of new life in our prison chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.9'>For we are servants; but our God has not been turned away from us in our prison, but has had mercy on us before the eyes of the kings of Persia, to give us new strength to put up again the house of our God and to make fair its waste places, and to give us a wall in Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.10'>And now, O our God, what are we to say after this? for we have not kept your laws,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.11'>Which you gave to your servants the prophets, saying, The land into which you are going, to take it for a heritage, is an unclean land, because of the evil lives of the peoples of the land and their disgusting ways, which have made the land unclean from end to end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.12'>So now do not give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or do anything for their peace or well-being for ever; so that you may be strong, living on the good of the land, and handing it on to your children for a heritage for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.13'>And after everything which has come on us because of our evil-doing and our great sin, and seeing that the punishment which you, O God, have given us, is less than the measure of our sins, and that you have kept from death those of us who are here;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.14'>Are we again to go against your orders, taking wives from among the people who do these disgusting things? would you not be angry with us till our destruction was complete, till there was not one who got away safe?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.9.15'>O Lord God of Israel, righteousness is yours; we are only a small band which has been kept from death, as at this day: see, we are before you in our sin; for no one may keep his place before you because of this.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezra.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.1'>Now while Ezra was making his prayer and his statement of wrongdoing, weeping and falling down before the house of God, a very great number of men and women and children out of Israel came together round him: for the people were weeping bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.2'>And Shecaniah, the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam, answering, said to Ezra, We have done evil against our God, and have taken as our wives strange women of the peoples of the land: but still there is hope for Israel in this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.3'>Let us now make an agreement with our God to put away all the wives and all their children, if it seems right to my lord and to those who go in fear of the words of our God; and let it be done in keeping with the law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.6'>Then Ezra got up from before the house of God and went into the room of Jehohanan, the son of Eliashib; but when he came there, he took no food or drink, for he was sorrowing for the sin of those who had come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.7'>And they made a public statement through all Judah and Jerusalem, to all those who had come back, that they were to come together to Jerusalem;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.9'>Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin came together to Jerusalem before three days were past; it was the ninth month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people were seated in the wide square in front of the house of God, shaking with fear because of this business and because of the great rain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.10'>And Ezra the priest got to his feet and said to them, You have done wrong and taken strange women for your wives, so increasing the sin of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.11'>So now, give praise to the Lord, the God of your fathers, and do his pleasure; and make yourselves separate from the peoples of the land and from the strange women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.12'>Then all the people, answering, said with a loud voice, As you have said, so it is right for us to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.10.13'>But the number of people is great, and it is a time of much rain; it is not possible for us to go on waiting outside, and this is not a thing which may be done in one day or even two: for our sin in this business is great.</verse>
