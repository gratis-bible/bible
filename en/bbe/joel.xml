      <chapter osisID='Joel.1'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.1'>The word of the Lord which came to Joel, the son of Pethuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.2'>Give ear to this, you old men, and take note, you people of the land. Has this ever been in your days, or in the days of your fathers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.3'>Give the story of it to your children, and let them give it to their children, and their children to another generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.4'>What the worm did not make a meal of, has been taken by the locust; and what the locust did not take, has been food for the plant-worm; and what the plant-worm did not take, has been food for the field-fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.5'>Come out of your sleep, you who are overcome with wine, and give yourselves to weeping; give cries of sorrow, all you drinkers of wine, because of the sweet wine; for it has been cut off from your mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.6'>For a nation has come up over my land, strong and without number; his teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he has the back teeth of a great lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.7'>By him my vine is made waste and my fig-tree broken: he has taken all its fruit and sent it down to the earth; its branches are made white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.8'>Make sounds of grief like a virgin dressed in haircloth for the husband of her early years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.9'>The meal offering and the drink offering have been cut off from the house of the Lord; the priests, the Lord's servants, are sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.10'>The fields are wasted, the land has become dry; for the grain is wasted, the new wine is kept back, the oil is poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.11'>The farmers are shamed, the workers in the vine-gardens give cries of grief, for the wheat and the barley; for the produce of the fields has come to destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.12'>The vine has become dry and the fig-tree is feeble; the pomegranate and the palm-tree and the apple-tree, even all the trees of the field, are dry: because joy has gone from the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.13'>Put haircloth round you and give yourselves to sorrow, you priests; give cries of grief, you servants of the altar: come in, and, clothed in haircloth, let the night go past, you servants of my God: for the meal offering and the drink offering have been kept back from the house of your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.14'>Let a time be fixed for going without food, have a holy meeting, let the old men, even all the people of the land, come together to the house of the Lord your God, crying out to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.15'>Sorrow for the day! for the day of the Lord is near, and as destruction from the Ruler of all it will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.16'>Is not food cut off before our eyes? joy and delight from the house of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.17'>The grains have become small and dry under the spade; the store-houses are made waste, the grain-stores are broken down; for the grain is dry and dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.18'>What sounds of pain come from the beasts! the herds of cattle are at a loss because there is no grass for them; even the flocks of sheep are no longer to be seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.19'>O Lord, my cry goes up to you: for fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste, and all the trees of the field are burned with its flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.1.20'>The beasts of the field are turning to you with desire: for the water-streams are dry and fire has put an end to the grass-lands of the waste.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.2'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.1'>Let the horn be sounded in Zion, and a war-cry in my holy mountain; let all the people of the land be troubled: for the day of the Lord is coming;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.2'>For a day of dark and deep shade is near, a day of cloud and black night: like a black cloud a great and strong people is covering the mountains; there has never been any like them and will not be after them again, from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.3'>Before them fire sends destruction, and after them flame is burning: the land is like the garden of Eden before them, and after them an unpeopled waste; truly, nothing has been kept safe from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.4'>Their form is like the form of horses, and they are running like war-horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.5'>Like the sound of war-carriages they go jumping on the tops of the mountains; like the noise of a flame of fire burning up the grain-stems, like a strong people lined up for the fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.6'>At their coming the people are bent with pain: all faces become red together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.7'>They are running like strong men, they go over the wall like men of war; every man goes straight on his way, their lines are not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.8'>No one is pushing against another; everyone goes straight on his way: bursting through the sword points, their order is not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.9'>They make a rush on the town, running on the wall; they go up into the houses and in through the windows like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.10'>The earth is troubled before them and the heavens are shaking: the sun and the moon have become dark, and the stars keep back their shining:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.11'>And the Lord is thundering before his forces; for very great is his army; for he is strong who gives effect to his word: for the day of the Lord is great and greatly to be feared, and who has strength against it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.12'>But even now, says the Lord, come back to me with all your heart, keeping from food, with weeping and with sorrow:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.13'>Let your hearts be broken, and not your clothing, and come back to the Lord your God: for he is full of grace and pity, slow to be angry and great in mercy, ready to be turned from his purpose of punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.14'>May it not be that he will again let his purpose be changed and let a blessing come after him, even a meal offering and a drink offering for the Lord your God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.15'>Let a horn be sounded in Zion, let a time be fixed for going without food, have a holy meeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.16'>Get the people together, make the mass of the people holy, send for the old men, get together the children and babies at the breast: let the newly married man come out of his room and the bride from her tent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.17'>Let the priests, the servants of the Lord, be weeping between the covered way and the altar, and let them say, Have mercy on your people, O Lord, do not give up your heritage to shame, so that the nations become their rulers: why let them say among the peoples, Where is their God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.18'>Then the Lord had a care for the honour of his land and had pity on his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.19'>And the Lord made answer and said to his people, See, I will send you grain and wine and oil in full measure: and I will no longer let you be shamed among the nations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.20'>I will send the one from the north far away from you, driving him into a dry and waste land, with his front to the sea of the east and his back to the sea of the west, and the smell of him will go up, even his evil smell will go up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.21'>Have no fear, O land; be glad with great joy; for the Lord has done great things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.22'>Have no fear, you beasts of the field, for the grass-lands of the waste are becoming green, for the trees are producing fruit, the fig-tree and the vine give out their strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.23'>Be glad, then, you children of Zion, and have joy in the Lord your God: for he gives you food in full measure, making the rain come down for you, the early and the late rain as at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.24'>And the floors will be full of grain, and the crushing-places overflowing with wine and oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.25'>I will give back to you the years which were food for the locust, the plant-worm, the field-fly, and the worm, my great army which I sent among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.26'>You will have food in full measure, and give praise to the name of the Lord your God, who has done wonders for you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.2.27'>And you will be certain that I am in Israel, and that I am the Lord your God, and there is no other: and my people will never be shamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Joel.3'>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.1'>\2:28\And after that, it will come about, says the Lord, that I will send my spirit on all flesh; and your sons and your daughters will be prophets, your old men will have dreams, your young men will see visions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.2'>\2:29\And on the servants and the servant-girls in those days I will send my spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.3'>\2:30\And I will let wonders be seen in the heavens and on the earth, blood and fire and pillars of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.4'>\2:31\The sun will be made dark and the moon turned to blood, before the great day of the Lord comes, a day to be feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.5'>\2:32\And it will be that whoever makes his prayer to the name of the Lord will be kept safe: for in Mount Zion and in Jerusalem some will be kept safe, as the Lord has said, and will be among the small band marked out by the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.6'>\3:1\For in those days and in that time, when I let the fate of Judah and Jerusalem be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.7'>\3:2\I will get together all the nations, and make them come down into the valley of Jehoshaphat; and there I will take up with them the cause of my people and of my heritage Israel, whom they have sent wandering among the nations, and of my land which has been parted by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.8'>\3:3\And they have put the fate of my people to the decision of chance: giving a boy for the price of a loose woman and a girl for a drink of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.9'>\3:4\And further, what are you to me, O Tyre and Zidon and all the circle of Philistia? will you give me back any payment? and if you do, quickly and suddenly I will send it back on your head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.10'>\3:5\For you have taken my silver and my gold, putting in the houses of your gods my beautiful and pleasing things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.11'>\3:6\And the children of Judah and the children of Jerusalem you have given for a price to the sons of the Greeks, to send them far away from their land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.12'>\3:7\See, I will have them moved from the place where you have sent them, and will let what you have done come back on your head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.13'>\3:8\I will give your sons and your daughters into the hands of the children of Judah for a price, and they will give them for a price to the men of Sheba, a nation far off: for the Lord has said it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.14'>\3:9\Give this out among the nations; make ready for war: get the strong men awake; let all the men of war come near, let them come up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.15'>\3:10\Get your plough-blades hammered into swords, and your vine-knives into spears: let the feeble say, I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.16'>\3:11\Come quickly, all you nations round about, and get yourselves together there: make your strong ones come down, O Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.17'>\3:12\Let the nations be awake, and come to the valley of Jehoshaphat: for there I will be seated as judge of all the nations round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.18'>\3:13\Put in the blade, for the grain is ready: come, get you down, for the wine-crusher is full, the vessels are overflowing; for great is their evil-doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.19'>\3:14\Masses on masses in the valley of decision! for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of decision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.20'>\3:15\The sun and the moon have become dark, and the stars keep back their shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.21'>\3:16\And the Lord will be thundering from Zion, and his voice will be sounding from Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth will be shaking: but the Lord will be a breastplate for his people and a strong place for the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.22'>\3:17\And you will be certain that I am the Lord your God, living in Zion, my holy mountain: and Jerusalem will be holy, and no strange person will ever again go through her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.23'>\3:18\And it will come about in that day that the mountains will be dropping sweet wine, and the hills will be flowing with milk, and all the streams of Judah will be flowing with water; and a fountain will come out from the house of the Lord, watering the valley of acacia-trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.24'>\3:19\Egypt will be a waste and Edom a land of destruction, because of the evil done to the children of Judah, because they have let blood be drained out in their land without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.25'>\3:20\But Judah will be peopled for ever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Joel.3.26'>\3:21\And I will send punishment for their blood, for which punishment has not been sent, for the Lord is living in Zion.</verse>
