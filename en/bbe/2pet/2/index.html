Ready to take chances, uncontrolled, they have no fear of saying evil of those in high places:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Though the angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not make use of violent language against them before the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But these men, like beasts without reason, whose natural use is to be taken and put to death, crying out against things of which they have no knowledge, will undergo that same destruction which they are designing for others;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For the evil which overtakes them is the reward of their evil-doing: such men take their pleasure in the delights of the flesh even in the daytime; they are like the marks of a disease, like poisoned wounds among you, feasting together with you in joy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Having eyes full of evil desire, never having enough of sin; turning feeble souls out of the true way; they are children of cursing, whose hearts are well used to bitter envy;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Turning out of the true way, they have gone wandering in error, after the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who was pleased to take payment for wrongdoing;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But his wrongdoing was pointed out to him: an ass, talking with a man's voice, put a stop to the error of the prophet.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>These are fountains without water, and mists before a driving storm; for whom the eternal night is kept in store.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>For with high-sounding false words, making use of the attraction of unclean desires of the flesh, they get into their power those newly made free from those who are living in error;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Saying that they will be free, while they themselves are the servants of destruction; because whatever gets the better of a man makes a servant of him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>For if, after they have got free from the unclean things of the world through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, they are again taken in the net and overcome, their last condition is worse than their first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>For it would have been better for them to have had no knowledge of the way of righteousness, than to go back again from the holy law which was given to them, after having knowledge of it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They are an example of that true saying, The dog has gone back to the food it had put out, and the pig which had been washed to its rolling in the dirty earth.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
