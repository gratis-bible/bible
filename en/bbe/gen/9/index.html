everything which goes on the land, and all the fishes of the sea, are given into your hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Every living and moving thing will be food for you; I give them all to you as before I gave you all green things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>But flesh with the life-blood in it you may not take for food.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And for your blood, which is your life, will I take payment; from every beast I will take it, and from every man will I take payment for the blood of his brother-man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Whoever takes a man's life, by man will his life be taken; because God made man in his image.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And now, be fertile and have increase; have offspring on the earth and become great in number.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And God said to Noah and to his sons,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Truly, I will make my agreement with you and with your seed after you,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And with every living thing with you, all birds and cattle and every beast of the earth which comes out of the ark with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And I will make my agreement with you; never again will all flesh be cut off by the waters; never again will the waters come over all the earth for its destruction.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said, This is the sign of the agreement which I make between me and you and every living thing with you, for all future generations:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will put my bow in the cloud and it will be for a sign of the agreement between me and the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And whenever I make a cloud come over the earth, the bow will be seen in the cloud,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And I will keep in mind the agreement between me and you and every living thing; and never again will there be a great flow of waters causing destruction to all flesh.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the bow will be in the cloud, and looking on it, I will keep in mind the eternal agreement between God and every living thing on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And God said to Noah, This is the sign of the agreement which I have made between me and all flesh on the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And the sons of Noah who went out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and Ham is the father of Canaan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>These three were the sons of Noah and from them all the earth was peopled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>In those days Noah became a farmer, and he made a vine-garden.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And he took of the wine of it and was overcome by drink; and he was uncovered in his tent.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw his father unclothed, and gave news of it to his two brothers outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Shem and Japheth took a robe, and putting it on their backs went in with their faces turned away, and put it over their father so that they might not see him unclothed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And, awaking from his wine, Noah saw what his youngest son had done to him, and he said,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Cursed be Canaan; let him be a servant of servants to his brothers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he said, Praise to the Lord, the God of Shem; let Canaan be his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>May God make Japheth great, and let his living-place be in the tents of Shem, and let Canaan be his servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Noah went on living three hundred and fifty years after the great flow of waters;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>all the years of his life were nine hundred and fifty: and he came to his end.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
