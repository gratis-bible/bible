it is to be a place for their houses and for grass-land and for cattle.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>A space of land twenty-five thousand long and ten thousand wide is to be for the Levites, the servants of the house, a property for themselves, for towns for their living-places.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And as the property for the town you are to have a part five thousand wide and twenty-five thousand long, by the side of the offering of the holy part of the land: this is to be for all the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And for the ruler there is to be a part on one side and on the other side of the holy offering and of the property of the town, in front of the holy offering and in front of the property of the town on the west of it and on the east: measured in the same line as one of the parts of the land, from its limit on the west to its limit on the east of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And this will be his heritage in Israel: and my rulers will no longer be cruel masters to my people; but they will give the land as a heritage to the children of Israel by their tribes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>This is what the Lord has said: Let this be enough for you, O rulers of Israel: let there be an end of violent behaviour and wasting; do what is right, judging uprightly; let there be no more driving out of my people, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Have true scales and a true ephah and a true bath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The ephah and the bath are to be of the same measure, so that the bath is equal to a tenth of a homer, and the ephah to a tenth of a homer: the unit of measure is to be a homer.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And the shekel is to be twenty gerahs: five shekels are five, and ten shekels are ten, and your maneh is to be fifty shekels</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>This is the offering you are to give: a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of wheat, and a sixth of an ephah out of a homer of barley;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the fixed measure of oil is to be a tenth of a bath from the cor, for ten baths make up the cor;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one lamb from the flock out of every two hundred, from all the families of Israel, for a meal offering and for a burned offering and for peace-offerings, to take away their sin, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>All the people are to give this offering to the ruler.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the ruler will be responsible for the burned offering and the meal offering and the drink offering, at the feasts and the new moons and the Sabbaths, at all the fixed feasts of the children of Israel: he will give the sin-offering and meal offering and burned offering and the peace-offerings, to take away the sin of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>This is what the Lord has said: In the first month, on the first day of the month, you are to take a young ox without any mark on him, and you are to make the holy place clean.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin-offering and put it on the uprights at the sides of the doors of the house, and on the four angles of the shelf of the altar, and on the sides of the doorway of the inner square.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And this you are to do on the seventh day of the month for everyone who is in error and for the feeble-minded: you are to make the house free from sin.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, you are to have the Passover, a feast of seven days;
