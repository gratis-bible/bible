When the son has done what is ordered and right, and has kept my rules and done them, life will certainly be his.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The soul which does sin will be put to death: the son will not be made responsible for the evil-doing of the father, or the father for the evil-doing of the son; the righteousness of the upright will be on himself, and the evil-doing of the evil-doer on himself.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But if the evil-doer, turning away from all the sins which he has done, keeps my rules and does what is ordered and right, life will certainly be his; death will not be his fate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Not one of the sins which he has done will be kept in memory against him: in the righteousness which he has done he will have life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Have I any pleasure in the death of the evil-doer? says the Lord: am I not pleased if he is turned from his way so that he may have life?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But when the upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, like all the disgusting things which the evil man does, will he have life? Not one of his upright acts will be kept in memory: in the wrong which he has done and in his sin death will overtake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But you say, The way of the Lord is not equal. Give ear, now, O children of Israel; is my way not equal? are not your ways unequal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>When the upright man, turning away from his righteousness, does evil, death will overtake him; in the evil which he has done death will overtake him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Again, when the evil-doer, turning away from the evil he has done, does what is ordered and right, he will have life for his soul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Because he had fear and was turned away from all the wrong which he had done, life will certainly be his, death will not be his fate.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But still the children of Israel say, The way of the Lord is not equal. O children of Israel, are my ways not equal? are not your ways unequal?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>For this cause I will be your judge, O children of Israel, judging every man by his ways, says the Lord. Come back and be turned from all your sins; so that they may not be the cause of your falling into evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Put away all your evil-doing in which you have done sin; and make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: why are you desiring death, O children of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>For I have no pleasure in the death of him on whom death comes, says the Lord: be turned back then, and have life.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
