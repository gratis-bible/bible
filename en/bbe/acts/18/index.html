for by trade they were tent-makers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And every Sabbath he had discussions in the Synagogue, turning Jews and Greeks to the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And when Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was completely given up to the word, preaching to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And when they put themselves against him, and said evil words, he said, shaking his clothing, Your blood be on your heads, I am clean: from now I will go to the Gentiles.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And moving from there, he went into the house of a man named Titus Justus, a God-fearing man, whose house was very near the Synagogue.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And Crispus, the ruler of the Synagogue, with all his family, had faith in the Lord; and a great number of the people of Corinth, hearing the word, had faith and were given baptism.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the Lord said to Paul in the night, in a vision, Have no fear and go on preaching:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>For I am with you, and no one will make an attack on you to do you damage: for I have a number of people in this town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And he was there for a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>But when Gallio was ruler of Achaia, all the Jews together made an attack on Paul, and took him to the judge's seat,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>Saying, This man is teaching the people to give worship to God in a way which is against the law.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>But when Paul was about to say something, Gallio said to the Jews, If this was anything to do with wrongdoing or crime, there would be a reason for me to give you a hearing:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>But if it is a question of words or names or of your law, see to it yourselves; I will not be a judge of such things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And he sent them away from the judge's seat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And they all made an attack on Sosthenes, the ruler of the Synagogue, and gave him blows before the judge's seat; but Gallio gave no attention to these things.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And Paul, after waiting some days, went away from the brothers and went by ship to Syria, Priscilla and Aquila being with him; and he had had his hair cut off in Cenchrea, for he had taken an oath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they came down to Ephesus and he left them there: and he himself went into the Synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And being requested by them to be there for a longer time, he said, No;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And went from them, saying, I will come back to you if God lets me; and he took ship from Ephesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had come to land at Caesarea, he went to see the church, and then went down to Antioch.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And having been there for some time, he went through the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, making the disciples strong in the faith.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by birth, and a man of learning, came to Ephesus; and he had great knowledge of the holy Writings.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>This man had been trained in the way of the Lord; and burning in spirit, he gave himself up to teaching the facts about Jesus, though he had knowledge only of John's baptism:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And he was preaching in the Synagogue without fear. But Priscilla and Aquila, hearing his words, took him in, and gave him fuller teaching about the way of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And when he had a desire to go over into Achaia, the brothers gave him help, and sent letters to the disciples requesting them to take him in among them: and when he had come, he gave much help to those who had faith through grace:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>For he overcame the Jews in public discussion, making clear from the holy Writings that the Christ was Jesus.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
