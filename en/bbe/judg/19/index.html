and where do you come from?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And he said to him, We are on our way from Beth-lehem-judah to the inmost parts of the hill-country of Ephraim: I came from there and went to Beth-lehem-judah: now I am on my way back to my house, but no man will take me into his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>But we have dry grass and food for our asses, as well as bread and wine for me, and for the woman, and for the young man with us: we have no need of anything.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the old man said, Peace be with you; let all your needs be my care; only do not take your rest in the street.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So he took them into his house and gave the asses food; and after washing their feet they took food and drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>While they were taking their pleasure at the meal, the good-for-nothing men of the town came round the house, giving blows on the door; and they said to the old man, the master of the house, Send out that man who came to your house, so that we may take our pleasure with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So the man, the master of the house, went out to them, and said, No, my brothers, do not this evil thing; this man has come into my house, and you are not to do him this wrong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>See, here is my daughter, a virgin, and his servant-wife: I will send them out for you to take them and do with them whatever you will. But do no such thing of shame to this man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But the men would not give ear to him: so the man took his woman and sent her out to them; and they took her by force, using her for their pleasure all night till the morning; and when dawn came they let her go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then at the dawn of day the woman came, and, falling down at the door of the man's house where her master was, was stretched there till it was light.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>In the morning her master got up, and opening the door of the house went out to go on his way; and he saw his servant-wife stretched on the earth at the door of the house with her hands on the step.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And he said to her, Get up and let us be going; but there was no answer; so he took her up and put her on the ass, and went on his way and came to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And when he had come to his house, he got his knife, and took the woman, cutting her up bone by bone into twelve parts, which he sent through all Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And he gave orders to the men whom he sent, saying, This is what you are to say to all the men of Israel, Has ever an act like this been done from the day when the children of Israel came out of Egypt to this day? Give thought to it, turning it over in your minds, and give your opinion of it.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
