I have been offering myself to those who were not searching for me; I said, Here am I, here am I, to a nation which gave no respect to my name.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>All day my hands have been stretched out to an uncontrolled people, who go in an evil way, after the purposes of their hearts;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>A people who make me angry every day, making offerings in gardens, and burning perfumes on bricks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Who are seated in the resting-places of the dead, and by night are in the secret places; who take pig's flesh for food, and have the liquid of disgusting things in their vessels.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Who say, Keep away, do not come near me, for fear that I make you holy: these are a smoke in my nose, a fire burning all day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>See, it is recorded before me, says the Lord: I will not keep back my hand, till I have sent punishment,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>For their sins and the sins of their fathers, who were burning perfumes on the mountains, and saying evil things against me on the hills: so I will take the measure of their sins, and will send the punishment for them into their breast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>This is the word of the Lord: As the new wine is seen in the grapes, and they say, Do not send destruction on it, for a blessing is in it: so will I do for my servants, in order that I may not put an end to them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And I will take a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah one who will have my mountains for a heritage: and the people I have taken to be mine will have it for themselves, and my servants will have their resting-place there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Sharon will be a grass-land for the flocks, and the valley of Achor a resting-place for the herds: for my people whose hearts have been turned back to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>But as for you who have given up the Lord, who have no care for my holy mountain, who get ready a table for Chance, and make offerings of mixed wine to Fate;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Your fate will be the sword, and you will all go down to death: because when my voice came to you, you made no answer; you did not give ear to my word; but you did what was evil in my eyes, desiring what was not pleasing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>For this cause says the Lord God, My servants will have food, but you will be in need of food: my servants will have drink, but you will be dry: my servants will have joy, but you will be shamed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>My servants will make songs in the joy of their hearts, but you will be crying for sorrow, and making sounds of grief from a broken spirit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And your name will become a curse to my people, and the Lord God will put you to death, and give his servants another name:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>So that he who is requesting a blessing will make use of the name of the true God, and he who takes an oath will do so by the true God; because the past troubles are gone out of mind, and because they are covered from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For see, I am making a new heaven and a new earth: and the past things will be gone completely out of mind.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But men will be glad and have joy for ever in what I am making; for I am making Jerusalem a delight, and her people a joy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will be glad over Jerusalem, and have joy in my people: and the voice of weeping will no longer be sounding in her, or the voice of grief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>No longer will there be there a child whose days are cut short, or an old man whose days have not come to their full measure: for the young man at his death will be a hundred years old, and he whose life is shorter than a hundred years will seem as one cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And they will be building houses and living in them; planting vine-gardens and getting the fruit of them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They will no longer be building for the use of others, or planting for others to have the fruit: for the days of my people will be like the days of a tree, and my loved ones will have joy in full measure in the work of their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Their work will not be for nothing, and they will not give birth to children for destruction; for they are a seed to whom the Lord has given his blessing, and their offspring will be with them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And before they make their request I will give an answer, and while they are still making prayer to me, I will give ear.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>The wolf and the lamb will take their food together, and the lion will make a meal of grass like the ox: but dust will be the snake's food. There will be no cause of pain or destruction in all my holy mountain, says the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
