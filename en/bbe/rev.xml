      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave him so that his servants might have knowledge of the things which will quickly take place: and he sent and made it clear by his angel to his servant John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>Who gave witness of the word of God, and of the witness of Jesus Christ, even of all the things which he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>A blessing be on the reader, and on those who give ear to the prophet's words, and keep the things which he has put in the book: for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from him who is and was and is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his high seat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>And from Jesus Christ, the true witness, the first to come back from the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who had love for us and has made us clean from our sins by his blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>And has made us to be a kingdom and priests to his God and Father; to him let glory and power be given for ever and ever. So be it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>See, he comes with the clouds, and every eye will see him, and those by whom he was wounded; and all the tribes of the earth will be sorrowing because of him. Yes, so be it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the First and the Last, says the Lord God who is and was and is to come, the Ruler of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, your brother, who have a part with you in the trouble and the kingdom and the quiet strength of Jesus, was in the island which is named Patmos, for the word of God and the witness of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and a great voice at my back, as of a horn, came to my ears,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>Saying, What you see, put in a book, and send it to the seven churches; to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamos and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And turning to see the voice which said these words to me, I saw seven gold vessels with lights burning in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>And in the middle of them one like a son of man, clothed with a robe down to his feet, and with a band of gold round his breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>And his head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>And his feet like polished brass, as if it had been burned in a fire; and his voice was as the sound of great waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword: and his face was like the sun shining in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I went down on my face at his feet as one dead. And he put his right hand on me, saying, Have no fear; I am the first and the last and the Living one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>And I was dead, and see, I am living for ever, and I have the keys of death and of Hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Put in writing, then, the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will be after these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The secret of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and of the seven gold vessels with burning lights. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches: and the seven lights are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the church in Ephesus say: These things says he who has the seven stars in his right hand, who is walking in the middle of the seven gold lights:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I have knowledge of your doings, and of your hard work and long waiting, and that you will not put up with evil men, and have put to the test those who say they are Apostles and are not, and have seen that they are false;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And you have the power of waiting, and have undergone trouble because of my name, without weariness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have this against you, that you are turned away from your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>So keep in mind where you were at first, and be changed in heart and do the first works; or I will come to you, and will take away your light from its place, if your hearts are not changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But at least you have the credit of hating the works of the Nicolaitans, as I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give of the fruit of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the church in Smyrna say: These things says the first and the last, who was dead and is living:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I have knowledge of your troubles and how poor you are (but you have true wealth), and the evil words of those who say they are Jews, and are not, but are a Synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Have no fear of the things which you will have to undergo: see, the Evil One will send some of you into prison, so that you may be put to the test; and you will have great trouble for ten days. Be true till death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches. He who overcomes will not come under the power of the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church in Pergamos say: These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I have knowledge that your living-place is where Satan has his seat: and you are true to my name, and were not turned away from your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my true witness, who was put to death among you, where Satan has his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have some things against you, because you have with you those who keep the teaching of Balaam, by whose suggestion Balak made the children of Israel go out of the right way, taking food which was offered to false gods, and going after the desires of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>And you have those who keep the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>See, then, that you have a change of heart; or I will come to you quickly, and will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes I will give of the secret manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name, of which no one has knowledge but he to whom it is given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel of the church in Thyatira say: These things says the Son of God, whose eyes are like a flame of fire, and his feet like polished brass:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I have knowledge of your works, and your love and faith and help and strength in trouble, and that your last works are more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have this against you, that you let the woman Jezebel say she is a prophet and give false teaching, making my servants go after the desires of the flesh and take food offered to false gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time for a change of heart, but she has no mind to give up her unclean ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>See, I will put her into a bed, and those who make themselves unclean with her, into great trouble, if they go on with her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will put her children to death; and all the churches will see that I am he who makes search into the secret thoughts and hearts of men: and I will give to every one of you the reward of your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you I say, to the rest in Thyatira, even to those who have not this teaching, and have no knowledge of the secrets of Satan, as they say; I put on you no other weight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But what you have, keep safe till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>He who overcomes, and keeps my works to the end, to him I will give rule over the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>And he will be ruling them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of the potter they will be broken, even as I have power from my Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the angel of the church in Sardis say: These things says he who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I have knowledge of your works, that you seem to be living but are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be on the watch, and make strong the rest of the things which are near to death; because as judged by me your works have not come up to God's measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Keep in mind, then, the teaching which was given to you, and be ruled by it and have a change of heart. If then you do not keep watch, I will come like a thief, and you will have no knowledge of the hour when I will come on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But you have some names in Sardis who have kept clean their robes; and as a reward they will go in white with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who overcomes will be dressed in white, and I will not take his name from the book of life, and I will give witness to his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia say: These things says he who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, opening the door so that it may be shut by no one, and shutting it so that it may be open to no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I have knowledge of your works (see, I have put before you an open door which may be shut by no one), and that you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and have been true to my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>See, I will make those of the Synagogue of Satan who say they are Jews, and are not, but say what is false; I will make them come and give worship before your feet, and see my love for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept my word in quiet strength, I will keep you from the hour of testing which is coming on all the world, to put to the test those who are on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I come quickly: keep that which you have, so that no one may take your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>Him who overcomes I will make a pillar in the house of my God, and he will go out no more: and I will put on him the name of my God, and the name of the town of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the church in Laodicea say: These things says the true and certain witness, the head of God's new order:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I have knowledge of your works, that you are not cold or warm: it would be better if you were cold or warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So because you are not one thing or the other, I will have no more to do with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>For you say, I have wealth, and have got together goods and land, and have need of nothing; and you are not conscious of your sad and unhappy condition, that you are poor and blind and without clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>If you are wise you will get from me gold tested by fire, so that you may have true wealth; and white robes to put on, so that your shame may not be seen; and oil for your eyes, so that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>To all those who are dear to me, I give sharp words and punishment: then with all your heart have sorrow for your evil ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>See, I am waiting at the door and giving the sign; if my voice comes to any man's ears and he makes the door open, I will come in to him, and will take food with him and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>To him who overcomes I will give a place with me on my high seat, even as I overcame, and am seated with my Father on his high seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He who has ears, let him give ear to what the Spirit says to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I saw a door open in heaven, and the first voice came to my ears, like the sound of a horn, saying, Come up here, and I will make clear to you the things which are to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Straight away I was in the Spirit: and I saw a high seat in heaven, and one was seated on it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And to my eyes he was like a jasper and a sardius stone: and there was an arch of light round the high seat, like an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round about the high seat were four and twenty seats: and on them I saw four and twenty rulers seated, clothed in white robes; and on their heads crowns of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the high seat came flames and voices and thunders. And seven lights of fire were burning before the high seat, which are the seven Spirits of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And before the high seat there was, as it seemed, a clear sea of glass; and in the middle of the high seat, and round about it, four beasts full of eyes round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first beast was like a lion, and the second like an ox, and the third had a face like a man, and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four beasts, having every one of them six wings, are full of eyes round about and inside: and without resting day and night, they say, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, Ruler of all, who was and is and is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when the beasts give glory and honour to him who is seated on the high seat, to him who is living for ever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>The four and twenty rulers go down on their faces before him who is seated on the high seat, and give worship to him who is living for ever and ever, and take off their crowns before the high seat, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>It is right, our Lord and our God, for you to have glory and honour and power: because by you were all things made, and by your desire they came into being.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat, a book with writing inside it and on the back, shut with seven stamps of wax.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a strong angel saying in a loud voice, Who is able to make the book open, and to undo its stamps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to get the book open, or to see what was in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I was very sad, because there was no one able to get the book open or to see what was in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the rulers said to me, Do not be sad: see, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome, and has power to undo the book and its seven stamps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw in the middle of the high seat and of the four beasts, and in the middle of the rulers, a Lamb in his place, which seemed as if it had been put to death, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent out into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took it out of the right hand of him who was seated on the high seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and the four and twenty rulers went down on their faces before the Lamb, having every one an instrument of music, and gold vessels full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And their voices are sounding in a new song, saying, It is right for you to take the book and to make it open: for you were put to death and have made an offering to God of your blood for men of every tribe, and language, and people, and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they are ruling on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I saw, and there came to my ears the sound of a great number of angels round about the high seat and the beasts and the rulers; and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>Saying with a great voice, It is right to give to the Lamb who was put to death, power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honour and glory and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And to my ears came the voice of everything in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and of all things which are in them, saying, To him who is seated on the high seat, and to the Lamb, may blessing and honour and glory and power be given for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four beasts said, So be it. And the rulers went down on their faces and gave worship.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when the Lamb undid one of the stamps, and the voice of one of the four beasts came to my ears, saying as with a voice of thunder, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw a white horse, and he who was seated on it had a bow; and there was given to him a crown: and he went out with power to overcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when the second stamp was undone, the voice of the second beast came to my ears, saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse came out, a red horse; and it was given to him who was seated on it to take peace from the earth, so that people might put one another to death: and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when the third stamp was undone, the voice of the third beast came to my ears, saying, Come and see. And I saw a black horse; and he who was seated on it had scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And a voice came to my ears, from the middle of the four beasts, saying, A measure of grain for a penny, and three measures of barley for a penny: and see that you do no damage to the oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when the fourth stamp was undone, the voice of the fourth beast came to my ears, saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I saw a grey horse, and the name of him who was seated on it was Death; and Hell came after him. And there was given to them authority over the fourth part of the earth, to put to destruction by the sword, and by taking away their food, and by death, and by the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when the fifth stamp was undone, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been put to death for the word of God, and for the witness which they kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they gave a great cry, saying, How long will it be, O Ruler, holy and true, before you take your place as judge and give punishment for our blood to those on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there was given to every one a white robe, and they were ordered to take their rest for a little time, till the number was complete of the other servants, their brothers, who would be put to death, even as they had been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when the sixth stamp was undone, and there was a great earth-shock; and the sun became black as haircloth, and all the moon became as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven were falling to the earth, like green fruit from a tree before the force of a great wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heaven was taken away like the roll of a book when it is rolled up; and all the mountains and islands were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the rulers, and the chief captains, and the men of wealth, and the strong, and every servant and free man, took cover in the holes and the rocks of the mountains;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Come down on us, covering us from the face of him who is seated on the high seat, and from the wrath of the Lamb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of their wrath is come, and who may keep his place?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this I saw four angels in their places at the four points of the earth, keeping back the four winds in their hands, so that there might be no moving of the wind on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the mark of the living God: and he said with a great voice to the four angels, to whom it was given to do damage to the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>Do no damage to the earth, or the sea, or the trees, till we have put a mark on the servants of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And there came to my ears the number of those who had the mark on their brows, a hundred and forty-four thousand, who were marked out of every tribe of the people of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as the teeth of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>And they had breastplates like iron, and the sound of their wings was as the sound of carriages, like an army of horses rushing to the fight.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.17'>And he took the measure of its wall, one hundred and forty-four cubits, after the measure of a man, that is, of an angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.18'>And the building of its wall was of jasper, and the town was clear gold, clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.19'>The bases of the wall of the town had ornaments of all sorts of beautiful stones. The first base was jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.20'>The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprase; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>And the twelve doors were twelve pearls; every door was made of one pearl; and the street of the town was clear gold, as clear as glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>And I saw no Temple there; because the Lord God, the Ruler of all, and the Lamb are its Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>And the town has no need of the sun, or of the moon, to give it light: for the glory of God did make it light, and the light of it is the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'>And the nations will go in its light: and the kings of the earth will take their glory into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.25'>And the doors of it will never be shut by day (for there is no night there):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.26'>And the glory and honour of the nations will come into it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.27'>And nothing unclean may come into it, or anyone whose works are cursed or false; but only those whose names are in the Lamb's book of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And I saw a river of water of life, clear as glass, coming out of the high seat of God and of the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>In the middle of its street. And on this side of the river and on that was the tree of life, having twelve sorts of fruits, giving its fruit every month; and the leaves of the tree give life to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And there will be no more curse: and the high seat of God and of the Lamb will be there; and his servants will be worshipping him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>And they will see his face; and his name will be on their brows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And there will be no more night; and they have no need of a light or of the shining of the sun; for the Lord God will give them light: and they will be ruling for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>And he said to me, These words are certain and true: and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, sent his angel to make clear to his servants the things which are now to come about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>See, I come quickly. A blessing on him who keeps the words of this book of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I, John, am he who saw these things and to whose ears they came. And when I had seen and given ear, I went down on my face to give worship at the feet of the angel who made these things clear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>And he said to me, See you do it not; I am a brother-servant with you and with your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book: give worship to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>And he said to me, Let not the words of this prophet's book be kept secret, because the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>Let the evil man go on in his evil: and let the unclean be still unclean: and let the upright go on in his righteousness: and let the holy be holy still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>See, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give to every man the outcome of his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the First and the Last, the start and the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>A blessing on those whose robes are washed, so that they may have a right to the tree of life, and may go in by the doors into the town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>Outside are the dogs, and those who make use of evil powers, those who make themselves unclean, and the takers of life, and those who give worship to images, and everyone whose delight is in what is false.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give witness to you of these things in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright and morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him who gives ear, say, Come. And let him who is in need come; and let everyone desiring it take of the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>For I say to every man to whose ears have come the words of this prophet's book, If any man makes an addition to them, God will put on him the punishments which are in this book:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>And if any man takes away from the words of this book, God will take away from him his part in the tree of life and the holy town, even the things which are in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>He who gives witness to these things says, Truly, I come quickly. Even so come, Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with the saints. So be it.</verse>
