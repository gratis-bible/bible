At that time Balak, the son of Zippor, was king of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he sent men to Balaam, son of Beor, at Pethor by the River in the land of the children of his people, saying to him, See, a people has come out of Egypt, covering all the face of the earth, and they have put up their tents opposite to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Come now, in answer to my prayer, and put a curse on this people, for they are greater than I: and then I may be strong enough to overcome them and send them out of the land: for it is clear that good comes to him who has your blessing, but he on whom you put your curse is cursed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>So the responsible men of Moab and Midian went away, taking in their hands rewards for the prophet; and they came to Balaam and said to him what Balak had given them orders to say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he said to them, Take your rest here tonight, and I will give you an answer after hearing what the Lord says; so the chiefs of Moab kept there with Balaam that night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And God came to Balaam and said, Who are these men with you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And Balaam said to God, Balak, the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent them to me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>See, the people who have come out of Egypt are covering all the earth: now, put a curse on this people for me, so that I may be able to make war on them, driving them out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And God said to Balaam, You are not to go with them, or put a curse on this people, for they have my blessing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>In the morning Balaam got up and said to the chiefs of Balak, Go back to your land, for the Lord will not let me go with you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So the chiefs of Moab went back to Balak and said, Balaam will not come with us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>So Balak sent more chiefs, greater in number and of higher position than the others.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And they came to Balaam and said, Balak, son of Zippor, says, Let nothing keep you from coming to me:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will give you a place of very great honour, and whatever you say to me I will do; so come, in answer to my prayer, and put a curse on this people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But Balaam, in answer; said to the servants of Balak, Even if Balak gave me his house full of silver and gold, it would not be possible for me to do anything more or less than the orders of the Lord my God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So take your rest here this night, till I have knowledge what more the Lord has to say to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And that night God came to Balaam and said to him, If these men have come for you, go with them: but do only what I say to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So in the morning Balaam got up and, making his ass ready, went with the chiefs of Moab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But God was moved to wrath because he went: and the angel of the Lord took up a position in the road to keep him from his purpose. Now he was seated on his ass, and his two servants were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the ass saw the angel of the Lord waiting in the road with his sword in his hand; and turning from the road, the ass went into the field; and Balaam gave the ass blows, to get her back on to the road.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then the angel of the Lord took up his position in a narrow road through the vine-gardens, with a wall on this side and on that.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the ass saw the angel of the Lord, and went near the wall, crushing Balaam's foot against the wall; and he gave her more blows.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then the angel of the Lord went further, stopping in a narrow place where there was no room for turning to the right or to the left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And the ass saw the angel of the Lord and went down on the earth under Balaam; and full of wrath, Balaam gave her hard blows with his stick.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Then the Lord gave the ass the power of talking, and opening her mouth she said to Balaam, What have I done to you that you have given me blows these three times?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And Balaam said to the ass, You have made me seem foolish: if only I had a sword in my hand I would put you to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the ass said to Balaam, Am I not your ass upon which you have gone all your life till this day? and have I ever done this to you before? And he said, No.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>Then the Lord made Balaam's eyes open, and he saw the angel of the Lord in the way with his sword in his hand: and he went down on his face to the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And the angel of the Lord said to him, Why have you given your ass blows these three times? See, I have come out against you to keep you back, because your purpose is not pleasing to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And the ass saw me, turning to one side from me three times: if she had not gone to one side, I would certainly have put you to death and kept her safe.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And Balaam said to the angel of the Lord, I have done wrong, for I did not see that you were in the way against me: but now, if it is evil in your eyes, I will go back again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>And the angel of the Lord said to Balaam, Go with the men; but say only what I give you to say. Then Balaam went on with the chiefs of Balak.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Now Balak, hearing that Balaam had come, went to the chief town of Moab, on the edge of the Arnon, in the farthest part of the land, for the purpose of meeting him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not send to you, requesting you with all my heart to come to me? why did you not come? am I not able to give you a place of honour?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="38">38</a>Then Balaam said to Balak, Now I have come to you; but have I power to say anything? Only what God puts into my mouth may I say.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="39">39</a>And Balaam went with Balak to Kiriath-huzoth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="40">40</a>And Balak made offerings of oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam and the chiefs who were with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="41">41</a>And in the morning Balak took Balaam up to the high places of Baal, and from there he was able to see the outer limits of the people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
