for your pain may never be taken away: because your evil-doing was so great and because your sins were increased, I have done these things to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For this cause, all those who take you for their food will themselves become your food; and all your attackers, every one of them, will be taken prisoners; and those who send destruction on you will come to destruction; and all those who take away your goods by force will undergo the same themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For I will make you healthy again and I will make you well from your wounds, says the Lord; because they have given you the name of an outlaw, saying, It is Zion cared for by no man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>The Lord has said, See, I am changing the fate of the tents of Jacob, and I will have pity on his houses; the town will be put up on its hill, and the great houses will be living-places again.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And from them will go out praise and the sound of laughing: and I will make them great in number, and they will not become less; and I will give them glory, and they will not be small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And their children will be as they were in the old days, and the meeting of the people will have its place before me, and I will send punishment on all who are cruel to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And their chief will be of their number; their ruler will come from among themselves; and I will let him be present before me, so that he may come near to me: for who may have strength of heart to come near me? says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And you will be my people, and I will be your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>See, the storm-wind of the Lord, even the heat of his wrath, has gone out, a rolling storm, bursting on the heads of the evil-doers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The wrath of the Lord will not be turned back till he has done, till he has put into effect, the purposes of his heart: in days to come you will have full knowledge of this.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
