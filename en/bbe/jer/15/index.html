I have not made men my creditors and I am not in debt to any, but every one of them is cursing me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>...</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Is it possible for iron to be broken; even iron from the north, and brass?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>I will give your wealth and your stores to your attackers, without a price, because of all your sins, even in every part of your land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>They will go away with your haters into a land which is strange to you: for my wrath is on fire with a flame which will be burning on you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>O Lord, you have knowledge: keep me in mind and come to my help, and give their right reward to those who are attacking me; take me not away, for you are slow to be angry: see how I have undergone shame because of you from all those who make little of your word;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But to me your word is a joy, making my heart glad; for I am named by your name, O Lord God of armies.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>I did not take my seat among the band of those who are glad, and I had no joy; I kept by myself because of your hand; for you have made me full of wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Why is my pain unending and my wound without hope of being made well? Sorrow is mine, for you are to me as a stream offering false hope and as waters which are not certain.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For this cause the Lord has said, If you will come back, then I will again let you take your place before me; and if you give out what is of value and not that which has no value, you will be as my mouth: let them come back to you, but do not go back to them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And I will make you a strong wall of brass to this people; they will be fighting against you, but they will not overcome you: for I am with you to keep you safe, says the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>I will keep you safe from the hands of the evil-doers, and I will give you salvation from the hands of the cruel ones.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
