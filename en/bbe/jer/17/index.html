let it come now.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>As for me, I have not said; Let the day of trouble come to them quickly; and I have not been hoping for the death-giving day; you have knowledge of what came from my lips; it was open before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Be not a cause of fear to me: you are my safe place in the day of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Let them be put to shame who are attacking me, but let me not be shamed; let them be overcome with fear, but let me not be overcome: send on them the day of evil, and put them to destruction twice over.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>This is what the Lord has said to me: Go and take your place in the doorway of Benjamin, where the kings of Judah come in and by which they go out, and in all the doorways of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And say to them, Give ear to the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah, and all the people of Jerusalem who come in by these doors:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>This is what the Lord has said: See to yourselves, that you take up no weight on the Sabbath day, or take it in through the doors of Jerusalem;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And take no weight out of your houses on the Sabbath day, or do any work, but keep the Sabbath day holy, as I gave orders to your fathers;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But they gave no attention and would not give ear, but they made their necks stiff so that they might not give ear and might not get teaching.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And it will be, that if with all care you give ear to me, says the Lord, and take no weight through the doorways of this town on the Sabbath day, but keep the Sabbath day holy and do no work in it;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>Then through the doors of this town there will come kings and princes, seated on the seat of David, going in carriages and on horseback, they and their princes, and the men of Judah and the people of Jerusalem: and this town will keep its place for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they will come from the towns of Judah, and from the places round about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the lowlands, and from the mountains, and from the South, with burned offerings and offerings of beasts and meal offerings and perfume and offerings of praise, to the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But if you do not give ear to me, to keep the Sabbath day holy, and to let no weight be lifted and taken through the doors of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day: then I will put a fire in its doorways, burning up the great houses of Jerusalem, and it will never be put out.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
