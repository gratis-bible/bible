And all the people had come together to Jeremiah in the house of the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And the rulers of Judah, hearing of these things, came up from the king's house to the house of the Lord, and took their seats by the new door of the Lord's house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then the priests and the prophets said to the rulers and to all the people, The right fate for this man is death; for he has said words against this town in your hearing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then Jeremiah said to all the rulers and to all the people, The Lord has sent me as his prophet to say against this house and against this town all the words which have come to your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>So now, make a change for the better in your ways and your doings, and give ear to the voice of the Lord your God; then the Lord will let himself be turned from the decision he has made against you for evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>As for me, here I am in your hands: do with me whatever seems good and right in your opinion.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Only be certain that, if you put me to death, you will make yourselves and your town and its people responsible for the blood of one who has done no wrong: for truly, the Lord has sent me to you to say all these words in your ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Then the rulers and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, It is not right for this man to be put to death: for he has said words to us in the name of the Lord our God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Then some of the responsible men of the land got up and said to all the meeting of the people,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Micah the Morashtite, who was a prophet in the days of Hezekiah, king of Judah, said to all the people of Judah, This is what the Lord of armies has said: Zion will become like a ploughed field, and Jerusalem will become a mass of broken walls, and the mountain of the house like the high places of the woodland.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Did Hezekiah and all Judah put him to death? did he not in the fear of the Lord make prayer for the grace of the Lord, and the Lord let himself be turned from the decision he had made against them for evil? By this act we might do great evil against ourselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And there was another man who was a prophet of the Lord, Uriah, the son of Shemaiah of Kiriath-jearim; he said against this town and against this land all the words which Jeremiah had said:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when his words came to the ears of Jehoiakim the king and all his men of war and his captains, the king would have put him to death; but Uriah, hearing of it, was full of fear and went in flight into Egypt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And Jehoiakim the king sent Elnathan, the son of Achbor, and certain men with him, into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they took Uriah out of Egypt and came back with him to Jehoiakim the king; who put him to death with the sword, and had his dead body put into the resting-place of the bodies of the common people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>But Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, gave Jeremiah his help, so that he was not given into the hands of the people to be put to death.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
