And he said to them,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Do your best to go in by the narrow door, for I say to you, A number will make the attempt to go in, but will not be able to do so.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>When the master of the house has got up, and the door has been shut, and you, still outside, give blows on the door, saying, Lord, let us in; he will make answer and say, I have no knowledge of where you come from.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>Then you will say, We have taken food and drink with you, and you were teaching in our streets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But he will say, Truly, I have no knowledge of you or where you come from; go away from me, you workers of evil.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>There will be weeping and cries of sorrow when you see Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets, in the kingdom of God, but you yourselves are shut outside.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they will come from the east and from the west, from the north and from the south, and take their places in the kingdom of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the last will be first, and the first will be last.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>At that time, certain Pharisees came to him and said, Go away from this place, because Herod's purpose is to put you to death.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he said, Go and say to that fox, I send out evil spirits and do works of mercy today and tomorrow, and on the third day my work will be complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>But I have to go on my way today and tomorrow and the third day, for it is not right for a prophet to come to his death outside Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, putting to death the prophets, and stoning those who were sent to her! again and again would I have taken your children to myself, as a bird takes her young ones under her wings, but you would not!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Now see, your house is waste, and I say to you, You will not see me again till you say, A blessing on him who comes in the name of the Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
