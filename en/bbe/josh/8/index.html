So Joshua took up his spear, stretching it out in the direction of the town.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then the secret force came quickly from their place, and running forward when they saw his hand stretched out, went into the town and took it, and put fire to it straight away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then the men of Ai, looking back, saw the smoke of the town going up to heaven, and were unable to go this way or that: and the people who had gone in flight to the waste land were turned back on those who were coming after them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the town had been taken by the surprise attack, and that the smoke of the town had gone up, turning round they overcame the men of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then the other force came out of the town against them, so that they were being attacked on this side and on that: and Israel overcame them and let not one of them get away with his life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But the king of Ai they made prisoner, and took him to Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Then, after the destruction of all the people of Ai in the field and in the waste land where they went after them, and when all the people had been put to death without mercy, all Israel went back to Ai, and put to death all who were in it without mercy.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>On that day twelve thousand were put to death, men and women, all the people of Ai.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>For Joshua did not take back his hand with the outstretched spear till the destruction of the people of Ai was complete.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>But the cattle and the goods from that town, Israel took for themselves, as the Lord had given orders to Joshua.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>So Joshua gave Ai to the flames, and made it a waste mass of stones for ever, as it is to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And he put the king of Ai to death, hanging him on a tree till evening: and when the sun went down, Joshua gave them orders to take his body down from the tree, and put it in the public place of the town, covering it with a great mass of stones, which is there to this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Then Joshua put up an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, in Mount Ebal,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In the way ordered by Moses, the servant of the Lord, as it is recorded in the book of the law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones, untouched by any iron instrument: and on it they made burned offerings and peace-offerings to the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>And he made there on the stones a copy of the law of Moses, writing it before the eyes of the children of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>And all Israel, those who were Israelites by birth, as well as the men from other lands living with them, and their responsible men and their overseers and judges, took their places round the ark, in front of the priests, the Levites, whose work it was to take up the ark of the Lord's agreement; half of them were stationed in front of Mount Gerizim and half in front of Mount Ebal, in agreement with the orders for the blessing of the children of Israel which Moses, the servant of the Lord, had given.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>And after, he gave them all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, as it is all recorded in the book of the law;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Reading to all the meeting of Israel, with the women and the children and the men from other lands who were living among them, every word of the orders which Moses had given.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
