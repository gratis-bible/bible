And his name was honoured far and wide; for he was greatly helped till he was strong.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>But when he had become strong, his heart was lifted up in pride, causing his destruction; and he did evil against the Lord his God; for he went into the Temple of the Lord for the purpose of burning perfumes on the altar of perfumes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Azariah the priest went in after him, with eighty of the Lord's priests, who were strong men;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they made protests to Uzziah the king, and said to him, The burning of perfumes, Uzziah, is not your business but that of the priests, the sons of Aaron, who have been made holy for this work: go out of the holy place, for you have done wrong, and it will not be to your honour before God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Then Uzziah was angry; and he had in his hand a vessel for burning perfume; and while his wrath was bitter against the priests, the mark of the leper's disease came out on his brow, before the eyes of the priests in the house of the Lord by the altar of perfumes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Azariah, the chief priest, and all the priests, looking at him, saw the mark of the leper on his brow, and they sent him out quickly and he himself went out straight away, for the Lord's punishment had come on him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So King Uzziah was a leper till the day of his death, living separately in his private house; for he was cut off from the house of God; and Jotham his son was ruling over his house, judging the people of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, were recorded by Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>So Uzziah went to rest with his fathers; and they put his body into the earth in the field used for the resting-place of the kings, for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son became king in his place.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
