for you have knowledge of your servant.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>O Lord, because of your servant, and from your heart, you have done all these great things and let them be seen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>O Lord, there is no one like you, and no other God but you, as is clear from everything which has come to our ears.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And what other nation in the earth, like your people Israel, did a god go out to take for himself, to be his people, making his name great and to be feared, driving out the nations from before your people whom you made free and took out of Egypt?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>For your people Israel you made yours for ever; and you, Lord, became their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And now, Lord, let your words about your servant and about his family be made certain for ever, and do as you have said.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So let your words be made certain and your name be made great, when men say, The Lord of armies is the God of Israel; and when the family of David your servant is made strong before you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>For you, O my God, have let your servant see that you will make him head of a line of kings; and so it has come into your servant's heart to make his prayer to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And now, O Lord, you are God, and you have said you will give this good thing to your servant:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And now you have been pleased to give your blessing to the family of your servant, so that it may go on for ever before you; you, O Lord, have given your blessing, and a blessing will be on it for ever.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
