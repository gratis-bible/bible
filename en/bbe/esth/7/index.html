If we had been taken as men-servants and women-servants for a price, I would have said nothing, for our trouble is little in comparison with the king's loss.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Then King Ahasuerus said to Esther the queen, Who is he and where is he who has had this evil thought in his heart?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>And Esther said, Our hater and attacker is this evil Haman. Then Haman was full of fear before the king and the queen.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And the king in his wrath got up from the feast and went into the garden: and Haman got to his feet to make a prayer for his life to Esther the queen: for he saw that the king's purpose was evil against him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then the king came back from the garden into the room where they had been drinking; and Haman was stretched out on the seat where Esther was. Then the king said, Is he taking the queen by force before my eyes in my house? And while the words were on the king's lips, they put a cloth over Haman's face.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then Harbonah, one of the unsexed servants waiting before the king, said, See, the pillar fifty cubits high, which Haman made for Mordecai, who said a good word for the king, is still in its place in Haman's house. Then the king said, Put him to death by hanging him on it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So Haman was put to death by hanging him on the pillar he had made for Mordecai. Then the king's wrath became less.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
