So there will be much shame and wrath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>If it is pleasing to the king, let an order go out from him, and let it be recorded among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, so that it may never be changed, that Vashti is never again to come before King Ahasuerus; and let the king give her place to another who is better than she.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when this order, given by the king, is made public through all his kingdom (for it is great), all the wives will give honour to their husbands, great as well as small.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this suggestion seemed good to the king and the captains; and the king did as Memucan said;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And sent letters to all the divisions of the kingdom, to every division in the writing commonly used there, and to every people in the language which was theirs, saying that every man was to be the ruler in his house, and that this order was to be given out in the language of his people.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
