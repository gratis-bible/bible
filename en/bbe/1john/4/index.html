By this we may see which is the true spirit, and which is the spirit of error.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>My loved ones, let us have love for one another: because love is of God, and everyone who has love is a child of God and has knowledge of God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>He who has no love has no knowledge of God, because God is love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And the love of God was made clear to us when he sent his only Son into the world so that we might have life through him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>And this is love, not that we had love for God, but that he had love for us, and sent his Son to be an offering for our sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>My loved ones, if God had such love for us, it is right for us to have love for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>No man has ever seen God: if we have love for one another, God is in us and his love is made complete in us:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And his Spirit which he has given us is the witness that we are in him and he is in us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And we have seen and give witness that the Father sent the Son to be the Saviour of the world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Everyone who says openly that Jesus is the Son of God, has God in him and is in God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And we have seen and had faith in the love which God has for us. God is love, and everyone who has love is in God, and God is in him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>In this way love is made complete in us, so that we may be without fear on the day of judging, because as he is, so are we in this world.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There is no fear in love: true love has no room for fear, because where fear is, there is pain; and he who is not free from fear is not complete in love.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>We have the power of loving, because he first had love for us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>If a man says, I have love for God, and has hate for his brother, his words are false: for how is the man who has no love for his brother whom he has seen, able to have love for God whom he has not seen?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And this is the word which we have from him, that he who has love for God is to have the same love for his brother.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
