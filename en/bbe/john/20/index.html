She said to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I have no knowledge where they have put him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And then looking round, she saw Jesus there, but had no idea that it was Jesus.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Jesus said to her, Woman, why are you weeping? who are you looking for? She, taking him for the gardener, said to him, Sir, if you have taken him away from here, say where you have put him and I will take him away.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Jesus said to her, Mary! Turning, she said to him in Hebrew, Rabboni! (which is to say, Master).</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Jesus said to her, Do not put your hand on me, for I have not gone up to the Father: but go to my brothers and say to them, I go up to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Mary Magdalene went with the news to the disciples, and said she had seen the Lord and that he had said these things to her.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>At evening on that day, the first day of the week, when, for fear of the Jews, the doors were shut where the disciples were, Jesus came among them and said to them, May peace be with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he had said this, he let them see his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And Jesus said to them again, May peace be with you! As the Father sent me, even so I now send you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when he had said this, breathing on them, he said to them, Let the Holy Spirit come on you:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>Any to whom you give forgiveness, will be made free from their sins; and any from whom you keep back forgiveness, will still be in their sins.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, named Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So the other disciples said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, If I do not see in his hands the print of the nails and put my finger into the print of the nails, and if I do not put my hand into his side, I will never have belief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And after eight days, his disciples were again in the house and Thomas was with them. Though the doors were shut, Jesus came, and taking his place in the middle of them, he said, May peace be with you!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Then he said to Thomas, Put out your finger, and see my hands; and put your hand here into my side: and be no longer in doubt but have belief.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And Thomas said in answer, My Lord and my God!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Jesus said to him, Because you have seen me you have belief: a blessing will be on those who have belief though they have not seen me!</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>A number of other signs Jesus did before his disciples which are not recorded in this book:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But these are recorded, so that you may have faith that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that, having this faith you may have life in his name.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
