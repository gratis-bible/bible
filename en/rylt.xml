      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>A roll of the birth of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah fathered Pharez and Zarah of Tamar, and Pharez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Ram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon fathered Boaz of Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed of Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse fathered David the king. And David the king fathered Solomon, of her who had been Uriah's,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzziah fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brethren, at the Babylonian removal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the Babylonian removal, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor fathered Sadok, and Sadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is named Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>All the generations, therefore, from Abraham unto David are fourteen generations, and from David unto the Babylonian removal fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian removal unto the Christ, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>And of Jesus Christ, the birth was thus: For his mother Mary having been betrothed to Joseph, before their coming together she was found to have conceived from the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>and Joseph her husband being righteous, and not willing to make her an example, did wish privately to send her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>And on his thinking of these things, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream appeared to him, saying, 'Joseph, son of David, you may not fear to receive Mary your wife, for that which in her was conceived is of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>and she shall bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he shall save his people from their sins.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>And all this has come to pass, that it may be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>'Lo, the virgin shall conceive, and she shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel,' which is, being interpreted 'With us he is God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph, having risen from the sleep, did as the messenger of the Lord directed him, and received his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and did not know her till she brought forth her son -- the first-born, and he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>And Jesus having been born in Beth-Lehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, lo, mages from the east came to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, 'Where is he who was born king of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east, and we came to bow to him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And Herod the king having heard, was stirred, and all Jerusalem with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and having gathered all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he was inquiring from them where the Christ is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>And they said to him, 'In Beth-Lehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And you, Beth-Lehem, the land of Judah, you are by no means the least among the leaders of Judah, for out of you shall come one leading, who shall feed My people Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, privately having called the mages, did inquire exactly from them the time of the appearing star,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and having sent them to Beth-Lehem, he said, 'Having gone -- inquire you exactly for the child, and whenever you may have found, bring me back word, that I also having come may bow to him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>And they, having heard the king, departed, and lo, the star, that they did see in the east, did go before them, till, having come, it stood over where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And having seen the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>and having come to the house, they found the child with Mary his mother, and having fallen down they bowed to him, and having opened their treasures, they presented to him gifts, gold, and frankincense, and myrrh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>and having been divinely warned in a dream not to turn back unto Herod, through another way they withdrew to their own region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>And on their having withdrawn, lo, a messenger of the Lord does appear in a dream to Joseph, saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and be you there till I may speak to you, for Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>And he, having risen, took the child and his mother by night, and withdrew to Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and he was there till the death of Herod, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, 'Out of Egypt I did call My Son.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, having seen that he was deceived by the mages, was very enraged, and having sent forth, he murdered all the male children in Beth-Lehem, and in all its borders, from two years and under, according to the time that he inquired exactly from the mages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>'A voice in Ramah was heard -- lamentation and weeping and much mourning -- Rachel weeping for her children, and she would not be comforted because they are not.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>And Herod having died, lo, a messenger of the Lord in a dream does appear to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, 'Having risen, take the child and his mother, and be going to the land of Israel, for they have died -- those seeking the life of the child.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And he, having risen, took the child and his mother, and came to the land of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>and having heard that Archelaus does reign over Judea instead of Herod his father, he was afraid to go there, and having been divinely warned in a dream, he withdrew to the parts of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and coming, he dwelt in a city named Nazareth, that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through the prophets, that 'A Nazarene he shall be called.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>And in those days comes John the Baptist, proclaiming in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, 'Reform, for come near has the reign of the heavens,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>for this is he who was spoken of by Isaiah the prophet, saying, 'A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, straight make you His paths.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And this John had his clothing of camel's hair, and a girdle of skin round his loins, and his nourishment was locusts and honey of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then were going forth unto him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region round about the Jordan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were baptized in the Jordan by him, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>And having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming about his baptism, he said to them, 'Brood of vipers! Who did show you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bear, therefore, fruits worthy of the reformation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to say in yourselves, A father we have -- Abraham, for I say to you, that God is able out of these stones to raise children to Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>and now also, the axe unto the root of the trees is laid, every tree therefore not bearing good fruit is hewn down, and to fire is cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>'I indeed do baptize you with water to reformation, but he who after me is coming is mightier than I, of whom I am not worthy to bear the sandals, he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose fan is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his floor, and will gather his wheat to the storehouse, but the chaff he will burn with fire unquenchable.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then comes Jesus from Galilee upon the Jordan, unto John to be baptized by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>but John was forbidding him, saying, 'I have need by you to be baptized -- and you do come unto me!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answering said to him, 'Permit now, for thus it is becoming to us to fulfill all righteousness,' then he does permit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And having been baptized, Jesus went up immediately from the water, and lo, opened to him were the heavens, and he saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove, and coming upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>and lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up to the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the Devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>and having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterwards he did hunger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the Tempter having come to him said, 'If Son you are of God -- speak that these stones may become loaves.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answering said, 'It has been written, Not upon bread alone does man live, but upon every word coming forth from the mouth of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then does the Devil take him to the holy city, and does set him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, 'If Son you are of God -- cast yourself down, for it has been written, that, His messengers He shall charge concerning you, and on hands they shall bear you up, that you may not dash on a stone your foot.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him again, 'It has been written, You shall not tempt the Lord your God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again does the Devil take him to a very high mount, and does show to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, 'All these to you I will give, if falling down you may bow to me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then said Jesus to him, 'Go -- Adversary, for it has been written, The Lord your God you shall bow to, and Him only you shall serve.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then does the Devil leave him, and lo, messengers came and were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>And Jesus having heard that John was delivered up, did withdraw to Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and having left Nazareth, having come, he dwelt at Capernaum that is by the sea, in the borders of Zebulun and Naphtalim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that it might be fulfilled that was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>'Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations! --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people that is sitting in darkness saw a great light, and to those sitting in a region and shadow of death -- light arose to them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time began Jesus to proclaim and to say, 'Reform you, for come near has the reign of the heavens.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brothers, Simon named Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea -- for they were fishers --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>and he said to them, 'Come you after me, and I will make you fishers of men,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>and they, immediately, having left the nets, did follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And having advanced from there, he saw other two brothers, James of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, refitting their nets, and he called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and they, immediately, having left the boat and their father, did follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus was going about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the good news of the reign, and healing every disease, and every malady among the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>and his fame went forth to all Syria, and they brought to him all having ailments, pressed with manifold sicknesses and pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there followed him many multitudes from Galilee, and Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And having seen the multitudes, he went up to the mount, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and having opened his mouth, he was teaching them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>'Blessed the poor in spirit -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>'Blessed the mourning -- because they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>'Blessed the meek -- because they shall inherit the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>'Blessed those hungering and thirsting for righteousness -- because they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>'Blessed the kind -- because they shall find kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>'Blessed the clean in heart -- because they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>'Blessed the peacemakers -- because they shall be called Sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>'Blessed those persecuted for righteousness' sake -- because theirs is the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>'Blessed are you whenever they may reproach you, and may persecute, and may say any evil thing against you falsely for my sake --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>rejoice you and be glad, because your rewardis great in the heavens, for thus did they persecute the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>'You are the salt of the land, but if the salt may lose savour, in what shall it be salted? For nothing is it good henceforth, except to be cast without, and to be trodden down by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>'You are the light of the world, a city set upon a mount is not able to be hid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>nor do they light a lamp, and put it under the measure, but on the lamp-stand, and it shines to all those in the house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>so let your light shine before men, that they may see your good works, and may glorify your Father whois in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>'Do not suppose that I came to throw out<note>abolish, annul, demolish, destroy, disunite, put down, take apart, weaken</note> the law or the prophets -- I did not come to throw out <note>abolish, annul, demolish, destroy, disunite, put down, take apart, weaken</note>, but to fulfill <note>bring to fulness, complete, fill up, make full</note>;}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>for, verily I say to you, till that the heaven and the earth may pass away, one iota<note>smallest Hebrew letter</note> or one tittle <note>point on a letter, serif</note> may not pass away from the law, till that all may come to pass.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>'Whoever therefore may loose one of these commands -- the least -- and may teach men so, least he shall be called in the reign of the heavens, but whoever may do and may teach, he shall be called great in the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>'For I say to you, that if your righteousness may not abound above that of the scribes and Pharisees, you may not enter to the reign of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>'You heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not kill, and whoever may kill shall be in danger of the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>but I -- I say to you, that every one who is angry at his brother without cause, shall be in danger of the judgment, and whoever may say to his brother, Empty fellow! Shall be in danger of the sanhedrin, and whoever may say, Rebel! Shall be in danger of the gehenna of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>'If, therefore, you may bring your gift to the altar, and there may remember that your brother has anything against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there your gift before the altar, and go -- first be reconciled to your brother, and then having come bring your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>'Be agreeing with your opponent quickly, while you are in the way with him, that the opponent may not deliver you to the judge, and the judge may deliver you to the officer, and to prison you may be cast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>verily I say to you, you may not come forth from there till that you may pay the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>'You heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not commit adultery;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>but I -- I say to you, that every one who is looking on a woman to desire her, did already commit adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>'But, if your right eye does cause you to stumble, pluck it out and cast from you, for it is good to you that one of your members may perish, and not your whole body be cast to gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>'And, if your right hand does cause you to stumble, cut it off, and cast from you, for it is good to you that one of your members may perish, and not your whole body be cast to gehenna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>'And it was said, That whoever may put away his wife, let him give to her a writing of divorce;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>but I -- I say to you, that whoever may put away his wife, except for the matter of whoredom, does make her to commit adultery; and whoever may marry her who has been put away does commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>'Again, you heard that it was said to the ancients: You shall not swear falsely, but you shall pay to the Lord your oaths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>but I -- I say to you, not to swear at all; neither by the heaven, because it is the throne of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, because it is His footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is a city of a great king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>nor by your head may you swear, because you are not able one hair to make white or black;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>but let your word be, Yes, Yes, No, No, and that which is more than these is of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>'You heard that it was said: Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>but I -- I say to you, not to resist the evil, but whoever shall slap you on your right cheek, turn to him also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>and whoever is willing to take you to law, and your coat to take -- permit to him also the cloak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>'And whoever shall impress you one mile, go with him two,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>to him who is asking of you be giving, and him who is willing to borrow from you may not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>'You heard that it was said: You shall love your neighbor, and shall hate your enemy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>but I -- I say to you, Love your enemies, bless those cursing you, do good to those hating you, and pray for those accusing you falsely, and persecuting you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>that you may be sons of your Father in the heavens, because His sun He does cause to rise on evil and good, and He does send rain on righteous and unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>'For, if you may love those loving you, what reward have you? Do not also the tax-gatherers the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you may salute your brethren only, what do you abundant? Do not also the tax-gatherers so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>You shall therefore be perfect, as your Father whois in the heavens is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, 'Sir, we have remembered that that deceiver said while yet living, After three days I do rise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>command, then, the sepulchre to be made secure till the third day, lest his disciples, having come by night, may steal him away, and may say to the people, He rose from the dead, and the last deceit shall be worse than the first.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>And Pilate said to them, 'You have a watch, go away, make secure -- as you have known;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>and his countenance was as lightning, and his clothing white as snow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>and from the fear of him did the keepers shake, and they became as dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>And the messenger answering said to the women, 'Fear not you, for I have known that Jesus, who has been crucified, you seek;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>A beginning of the good news of Jesus Christ, Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it has been written in the prophets, 'Lo, I send My messenger before your face, who shall prepare your way <note>who shall engineer your road</note> before you,' --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>'A voice of one calling in the wilderness, Prepare you the way of the Lord, straight make you his paths,' --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John came baptizing in the wilderness, and proclaiming a baptism of reformation -- to remission of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>and there were going forth to him all the region of Judea, and they of Jerusalem, and they were all baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was clothed with camel's hair, and a girdle of skin around his loins, and eating locusts and honey of the field,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>and he proclaimed, saying, 'He does come -- who is mightier than I -- after me, of whom I am not worthy -- having stooped down -- to loose the latchet of his sandals;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed did baptize you with water, but he shall baptize you with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those days, Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John at the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>and immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens dividing, and the Spirit as a dove coming down upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>and a voice came out of the heavens, 'You are My Son -- the Beloved, in whom I did delight.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately does the Spirit put him forth to the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>and he was there in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by the Adversary, and he was with the beasts, and the messengers were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>And after the delivering up of John, Jesus came to Galilee, proclaiming the good news of the reign of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying -- 'Fulfilled has been the time, and the reign of God has come near, reform you, and believe in the good news.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And, walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon, and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea, for they were fishers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>and Jesus said to them, 'Come you after me, and I shall make you to become fishers of men;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>and immediately, having left their nets, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And having gone on thence a little, he saw James of Zebedee, and John his brother, and they were in the boat refitting the nets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>and immediately he called them, and, having left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants, they went away after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they go on to Capernaum, and immediately, on the sabbaths, having gone into the synagogue, he was teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>and they were astonished at his teaching, for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, 'Away! what -- to us and to you, Jesus the Nazarene? you did come to destroy us; I have known you who you are -- the Holy One of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, 'Be silenced, and come forth out of him,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>and the unclean spirit having torn him, and having cried with a great voice, came forth out of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>and they were all amazed, so as to reason among themselves, saying, 'What is this? what new teaching is this? that with authority also the unclean spirits he commands, and they obey him!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And the fame of him went forth immediately to all the region, round about, of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And immediately, having come forth out of the synagogue, they went to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>and the mother-in-law of Simon was lying fevered, and immediately they tell him about her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>and having come near, he raised her up, having laid hold of her hand, and the fever left her immediately, and she was ministering to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>And evening having come, when the sun did set, they brought unto him all who were ill, and who were demoniacs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and the whole city was gathered together near the door,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>and he healed many who were ill of manifold diseases, and many demons he cast forth, and was not suffering the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And very early, it being yet night, having risen, he went forth, and went away to a desert place, and was there praying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>and Simon and those with him went in quest of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and having found him, they say to him, -- 'All do seek you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>and he said to them, 'We may go to the next towns, that there also I may preach, for this I came forth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he was preaching in their synagogues, in all Galilee, and is casting out the demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>and there does come to him a leper, calling on him, and kneeling to him, and saying to him -- 'If you may will, you are able to cleanse me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus having been moved with compassion, having stretched forth the hand, touched him, and said to him, 'I will; be you cleansed;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>and he having spoken, immediately the leprosy went away from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And having sternly charged him, immediately he put him forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and said to him, 'See you may say nothing to any one, but go away, yourself show to the priest, and bring near for your cleansing the things Moses directed, for a testimony to them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>And he, having gone forth, began to proclaim much, and to spread abroad the thing, so that no more he was able openly to enter into the city, but he was without in desert places, and they were coming unto him from every quarter.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again he entered into Capernaum, after some days, and it was heard that he is in the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>and immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door, and he was speaking to them the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they come unto him, bringing a paralytic, borne by four,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>and not being able to come near to him because of the multitude, they uncovered the roof where he was, and, having broken it up, they let down the couch on which the paralytic was lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>and Jesus having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, 'Child, your sins have been forgiven you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>And there were certain of the scribes there sitting, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>'Why does this one thus speak evil words? who is able to forgive sins except one -- God?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately Jesus, having known in his spirit that they thus reason in themselves, said to them, 'Why these things reason you in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, The sins have been forgiven to you? or to say, Rise, and take up your couch, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>'And, that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins -- (he said to the paralytic) --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I say to you, Rise, and take up your couch, and go away to your house;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>and he rose immediately, and having taken up the couch, he went forth before all, so that all were astonished, and do glorify God, saying -- 'Never thus did we see.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went forth again by the sea, and all the multitude was coming unto him, and he was teaching them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>and passing by, he saw Levi of Alpheus sitting at the tax-office, and said to him, 'Be following me,' and he, having risen, did follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) in his house, that many tax-gatherers and sinners were reclining (at meat) with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes and the Pharisees, having seen him eating with the tax-gatherers and sinners, said to his disciples, 'Why -- that with the tax-gatherers and sinners he does eat and drink?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And Jesus, having heard, said to them, 'They who are strong have no need of a physician, but they who are ill; I came not to call righteous men, but sinners to reformation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees were fasting, and they come and say to him, 'Therefore do the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast, and your disciples do not fast?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, 'Are the sons of the bride-chamber able, while the bridegroom is with them, to fast? so long time as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>but days shall come when the bridegroom may be taken from them, and then they shall fast -- in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>'And no one a patch of undressed cloth does sew on an old garment, and if not -- the new filling it up does take from the old and the rent does become worse;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>and no one does put new wine into old skins, and if not -- the new wine does burst the skins, and the wine is poured out, and the skins will be destroyed; but new wine into new skins is to be put.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass -- he is going along on the sabbaths through the corn-fields -- and his disciples began to make a way, plucking the ears,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>and the Pharisees said to him, 'Lo, why do they on the sabbaths that which is not lawful?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them, 'Did you never read what David did, when he had need and was hungry, he and those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he went into the house of God, (at 'Abiathar the chief priest,') and the loaves of the presentation did eat, which it is not lawful to eat, except to the priests, and he gave also to those who were with him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, 'The sabbath for man was made, not man for the sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>so that the son of man is lord also of the sabbath.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue, and there was there a man having the hand withered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>and they were watching him, whether on the sabbaths he will heal him, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he said to the man having the hand withered, 'Rise up in the midst.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he said to them, 'Is it lawful on the sabbaths to do good, or to do evil? life to save, or to kill?' but they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And having looked round upon them with anger, being grieved for the hardness of their heart, he said to the man, 'Stretch forth your hand;' and he stretched forth, and his hand was restored whole as the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>and the Pharisees having gone forth, immediately, with the Herodians, were taking counsel against him how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jesus withdrew with his disciples unto the sea, and a great multitude from Galilee followed him, and from Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem, and from Idumea and beyond the Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon -- a great multitude -- having heard how great things he was doing, came unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he said to his disciples that a little boat may wait on him, because of the multitude, that they may not press upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>for he did heal many, so that they threw themselves on him, in order to touch him -- as many as had plagues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>and the unclean spirits, when they were seeing him, were falling down before him, and were crying, saying -- 'You are the Son of God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>and many times he was charging them that they might not make him manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goes up to the mountain, and does call near whom he willed, and they went away to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>and he appointed twelve, that they may be with him, and that he may send them forth to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have power to heal the sicknesses, and to cast out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he put on Simon the name Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James of Zebedee, and John the brother of James, and he put on them names -- Boanerges, that is, 'Sons of thunder;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who did also deliver him up; and they come into a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And come together again does a multitude, so that they are not able even to eat bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>and his friends having heard, went forth to lay hold on him, for they said that he was beside himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>and the scribes who are from Jerusalem having come down, said -- 'He has Beelzeboul,' and -- 'By the ruler of the demons he does cast out the demons.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And, having called them near, in similes he said to them, 'How is the Adversary able to cast out the Adversary?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>and if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom cannot be made to stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>and if a house against itself be divided, that house cannot be made to stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>and if the Adversary did rise against himself, and has been divided, he cannot be made to stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>'No one is able the vessels of the strong man -- having entered into his house -- to spoil, if first he may not bind the strong man, and then his house he will spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>'Verily I say to you, that all the sins shall be forgiven to the sons of men, and evil speakings with which they might speak evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever may speak evil in regard to the Holy Spirit has not forgiveness -- to the age, but is in danger of age-during judgment;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they said, 'He has an unclean spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then come do his brethren and mother, and standing without, they sent unto him, calling him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>and a multitude was sitting about him, and they said to him, 'Lo, your mother and your brethren without do seek you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered them, saying, 'Who is my mother, or my brethren?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And having looked round in a circle to those sitting about him, he said, 'Lo, my mother and my brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>for whoever may do the will of God, he is my brother, and my sister, and mother.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach by the sea, and there was gathered unto him a great multitude, so that he, having gone into the boat, sat in the sea, and all the multitude was near the sea, on the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>and he taught them many things in similes, and he said to them in his teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>'Hearken, lo, the sower went forth to sow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>and it came to pass, in the sowing, some fell by the way, and the fowls of the heaven did come and devour it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>and other fell upon the rocky ground, where it had not much earth, and immediately it sprang forth, because of not having depth of earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>and the sun having risen, it was scorched, and because of not having root it did wither;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>and other fell toward the thorns, and the thorns did come up, and choke it, and fruit it gave not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>and other fell to the good ground, and was giving fruit, coming up and increasing, and it bare, one thirty-fold, and one sixty, and one an hundred.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said to them, 'He who is having ears to hear -- let him hear.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, those about him, with the twelve, did ask him of the simile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>and he said to them, 'To you it has been given to know the secret of the reign of God, but to those who are without, in similes are all the things done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand, lest they may turn, and the sins may be forgiven them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said to them, 'Have you not known this simile? and how shall you know all the similes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>He who is sowing does sow the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>and these are they by the way where the word is sown: and whenever they may hear, immediately comes the Adversary, and he takes away the word that has been sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>'And these are they, in like manner, who on the rocky ground are sown: who, whenever they may hear the word, immediately with joy do receive it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and have not root in themselves, but are temporary; afterward tribulation or persecution having come because of the word, immediately they are stumbled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>'And these are they who toward the thorns are sown: these are they who are hearing the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of the riches, and the desires concerning the other things, entering in, choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>'And these are they who on the good ground have been sown: who do hear the word, and receive, and do bear fruit, one thirty-fold, and one sixty, and one an hundred.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, 'Does the lamp come that under the measure it may be put, or under the couch -- not that it may be put on the lamp-stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>for there is not anything hid that may not be manifested, nor was anything kept hid but that it may come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any has ears to hear -- let him hear.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, 'Take heed what you hear; in what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you; and to you who hear it shall be added;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>for whoever may have, there shall be given to him, and whoever has not, also that which he has shall be taken from him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, 'Thus is the reign of God: as if a man may cast the seed on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and may sleep, and may rise night and day, and the seed spring up and grow, he has not known how;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>for of itself does the earth bear fruit, first a blade, afterwards an ear, afterwards full corn in the ear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>and whenever the fruit may yield itself, immediately he does send forth the sickle, because the harvest has come.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, 'To what may we liken the reign of God, or in what simile may we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>As a grain of mustard, which, whenever it may be sown on the earth, is less than any of the seeds that are on the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>and whenever it may be sown, it comes up, and does become greater than any of the herbs, and does make great branches, so that under its shade the fowls of the heaven are able to rest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many such similes he was speaking to them the word, as they were able to hear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>and without a simile he was not speaking to them, and by themselves, to his disciples he was expounding all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And he said to them on that day, evening having come, 'We may pass over to the other side;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>and having let away the multitude, they take him up as he was in the boat, and other little boats also were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there comes a great storm of wind, and the waves were beating on the boat, so that it is now being filled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>and he himself was upon the stern, upon the pillow sleeping, and they wake him up, and say to him, 'Teacher, are you not caring that we perish?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And having waked up, he rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, 'Peace, be stilled;' and the wind did lull, and there was a great calm:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>and he said to them, 'Why are you so fearful? how have you not faith?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>and they feared a great fear, and said one to another, 'Who, then, is this, that even the wind and the sea do obey him?'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadarenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>and he having come forth out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who had his dwelling in the tombs, and not even with chains was any one able to bind him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because that he many times with fetters and chains had been bound, and pulled in pieces by him had been the chains, and the fetters broken in pieces, and none was able to tame him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>and always, night and day, in the mountains, and in the tombs he was, crying and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And, having seen Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and having called with a loud voice, he said, 'What -- to me and to you, Jesus, Son of God the Most High? I adjure you by God, may you not afflict me!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>(for he said to him, 'Come forth, spirit unclean, out of the man,')</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>and he was questioning him, 'Whatis your name?' and he answered, saying, 'Legion is my name, because we are many;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>and he was calling on him much, that he may not send them out of the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>And there was there, near the mountains, a great herd of swine feeding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>and all the demons did call upon him, saying, 'Send us to the swine, that into them we may enter;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>and immediately Jesus gave them leave, and having come forth, the unclean spirits did enter into the swine, and the herd did rush down the steep place to the sea -- and they were about two thousand -- and they were choked in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And those feeding the swine did flee, and told in the city, and in the fields, and they came forth to see what it is that has been done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>and they come unto Jesus, and see the demoniac, sitting, and clothed, and right-minded -- him having had the legion -- and they were afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>and those having seen it, declared to them how it had come to pass to the demoniac, and about the swine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>and they began to call upon him to go away from their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And he having gone into the boat, the demoniac was calling on him that he may be with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>and Jesus did not suffer him, but said to him, 'Go away to your house, unto your ownfriends, and tell them how great things the Lord did to you, and dealt kindly with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went away, and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how great things Jesus did to him, and all were wondering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And Jesus having passed over in the boat again to the other side, there was gathered a great multitude to him, and he was near the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>and lo, there does come one of the chiefs of the synagogue, by name Jairus, and having seen him, he does fall at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and he was calling upon him much, saying -- 'My little daughter is at the last extremity -- that having come, you may lay on her your hands, so that she may be saved, and she shall live;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>and he went away with him. And there was following him a great multitude, and they were thronging him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>and a certain woman, having an issue of blood twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and many things having suffered under many physicians, and having spent all that she had, and having profited nothing, but rather having come to the worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>having heard about Jesus, having come in the multitude behind, she touched his garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>for she said -- 'If even his garments I may touch, I shall be saved;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>and immediately was the fountain of her blood dried up, and she knew in the body that she has been healed of the plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And immediately Jesus having known in himself that out of him power had gone forth, having turned about in the multitude, said, 'Who did touch my garments?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>and his disciples said to him, 'You see the multitude thronging you, and you say, 'Who did touch me!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he was looking round to see her who did this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>and the woman, having been afraid, and trembling, knowing what was done on her, came, and fell down before him, and told him all the truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>and he said to her, 'Daughter, your faith has saved you; go away in peace, and be whole from your plague.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>As he is yet speaking, there come from the chief of the synagogue's house, certain, saying -- 'Your daughter did die, why still do you harass the Teacher?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>And Jesus immediately, having heard the word that is spoken, said to the chief of the synagogue, 'Be not afraid, only believe.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he did not suffer any one to follow with him, except Peter, and James, and John the brother of James;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>and he comes to the house of the chief of the synagogue, and sees a tumult, much weeping and wailing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>and having gone in he said to them, 'Why do you make a tumult, and weep? the child did not die, but does sleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>and they were laughing at him. And he, having put all forth, does take the father of the child, and the mother, and those with him, and goes in where the child is lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>and, having taken the hand of the child, he said to her, 'Talitha cumi;' which is, being interpreted, 'Damsel (I say to you), arise.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the damsel arose, and was walking, for she was twelve years old; and they were amazed with a great amazement,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>and he charged them much, that no one may know this thing, and he said that there be given to her to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And he went forth thence, and came to his own country, and his disciples do follow him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>and sabbath having come, he began in the synagogue to teach, and many hearing were astonished, saying, 'Whence has this one these things? and what the wisdom that was given to him, that also such mighty works through his hands are done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, and Joses, and Judas, and Simon? and are not his sisters here with us?' -- and they were being stumbled at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>And Jesus said to them -- 'A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his kindred, and in his own house;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>and he was not able there any mighty work to do, except on a few infirm people having put hands he did heal them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>and he wondered because of their unbelief. And he was going round the villages, in a circle, teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>and he does call near the twelve, and he began to send them forth two by two, and he was giving them power over the unclean spirits,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>and he commanded them that they may take nothing for the way, except a staff only -- no scrip, no bread, no brass in the girdle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but having been shod with sandals, and you may not put on two coats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, 'Whenever you may enter into a house, there remain till you may depart thence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>and as many as may not receive you, nor hear you, going out thence, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony to them; verily I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Sodom or Gomorrah in a day of judgment than for that city.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And having gone forth they were preaching that men might reform,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>and many demons they were casting out, and they were anointing with oil many infirm, and they were healing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And the king Herod heard, (for his name became public,) and he said -- 'John the Baptist out of the dead was raised, and because of this the mighty powers are working in him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others said -- 'It is Elijah,' and others said -- 'It is a prophet, or as one of the prophets.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>And Herod having heard, said -- 'He whom I did behead -- John -- this is he; he was raised out of the dead.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself, having sent forth, did lay hold on John, and bound him in the prison, because of Herodias the wife of Philip his brother, because he married her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>for John said to Herod -- 'It is not lawful to you to have the wife of your brother;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>and Herodias was having a quarrel with him, and was willing to kill him, and was not able,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>for Herod was fearing John, knowing him a man righteous and holy, and was keeping watch over him, and having heard him, was doing many things, and hearing him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And a seasonable day having come, when Herod on his birthday was making a supper to his great men, and to the chiefs of thousands, and to the first men of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>and the daughter of that Herodias having come in, and having danced, and having pleased Herod and those reclining (at meat) with him, the king said to the damsel, 'Ask of me whatever you will, and I will give to you,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>and he sware to her -- 'Whatever you may ask me, I will give to you -- unto the half of my kingdom.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>And she, having gone forth, said to her mother, 'What shall I ask for myself?' and she said, 'The head of John the Baptist;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>and having come in immediately with haste unto the king, she asked, saying, 'I will that you may give me presently, upon a plate, the head of John the Baptist.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And the king -- made very sorrowful -- because of the oaths and of those reclining (at meat) with him, would not put her away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>and immediately the king having sent a guardsman, did command his head to be brought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and he having gone, beheaded him in the prison, and brought his head upon a plate, and did give it to the damsel, and the damsel did give it to her mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>and having heard, his disciples came and took up his corpse, and laid it in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>And the apostles are gathered together unto Jesus, and they told him all, and how many things they did, and how many things they taught,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>and he said to them, 'Come you yourselves apart to a desert place, and rest a little,' for those coming and those going were many, and not even to eat had they opportunity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>and they went away to a desert place, in the boat, by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>And the multitudes saw them going away, and many recognized him, and by land from all the cities they ran thither, and went before them, and came together to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>and having come forth, Jesus saw a great multitude, and was moved with compassion on them, that they were as sheep not having a shepherd, and he began to teach many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And now the hour being advanced, his disciples having come near to him, say, -- 'The place is desolate, and the hour is now advanced,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>let them away, that, having gone away to the surrounding fields and villages, they may buy to themselves loaves, for what they may eat they have not.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>And he answering said to them, 'Give you them to eat,' and they say to him, 'Having gone away, may we buy two hundred denaries' worth of loaves, and give to them to eat?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>And he said to them, 'How many loaves have you? go and see;' and having known, they say, 'Five, and two fishes.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>And he commanded them to make all recline in companies upon the green grass,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>and they sat down in squares, by hundreds, and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And having taken the five loaves and the two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, he blessed, and brake the loaves, and was giving to his disciples, that they may set before them, and the two fishes divided he to all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>and they did all eat, and were filled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>and they took up of broken pieces twelve hand-baskets full, and of the fishes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>and those eating of the loaves were about five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he constrained his disciples to go into the boat, and to go before to the other side, unto Bethsaida, till he may let the multitude away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>and having taken leave of them, he went away to the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And evening having come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he alone upon the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>and he saw them harassed in the rowing, for the wind was against them, and about the fourth watch of the night he does come to them walking on the sea, and wished to pass by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>And they having seen him walking on the sea, thought it to be an apparition, and cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for they all saw him, and were troubled, and immediately he spake with them, and said to them, 'Take courage, I amhe, be not afraid.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up unto them to the boat, and the wind lulled, and greatly out of measure were they amazed in themselves, and were wondering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they understood not concerning the loaves, for their heart has been hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And having passed over, they came upon the land of Gennesaret, and drew to the shore,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>and they having come forth out of the boat, immediately having recognized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>having run about through all that region round about, they began upon the couches to carry about those ill, where they were hearing that he is,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>and wherever he was going, to villages, or cities, or fields, in the market-places they were laying the infirm, and were calling upon him, that they may touch if it were but the fringe of his garment, and as many as were touching him were saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>And gathered together unto him are the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, having come from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>and having seen certain of his disciples with defiled hands -- that is, unwashed -- eating bread, they found fault;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>for the Pharisees, and all the Jews, if they do not wash the hands to the wrist, do not eat, holding the tradition of the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>and, coming from the market-place, if they do not baptize themselves, they do not eat; and many other things there are that they received to hold, baptisms of cups, and pots, and brazen vessels, and couches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>Then question him do the Pharisees and the scribes, 'Therefore do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but with unwashed hands do eat the bread?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>and he answering said to them -- 'Well did Isaiah prophesy concerning you, hypocrites, as it has been written, This people with the lips does honor Me, and their heart is far from Me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>and in vain do they worship Me, teaching teachings, commands of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>for, having put away the command of God, you hold the tradition of men, baptisms of pots and cups; and many other such like things you do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And he said to them, 'Well do you put away the command of God that your tradition you may keep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>for Moses said, Honour your father and your mother; and, He who is speaking evil of father or mother -- let him die the death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>and you say, If a man may say to father or to mother, Korban (that is, a gift),is whatever you may be profited out of mine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>and no more do you suffer him to do anything for his father or for his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>setting aside the word of God for your tradition that you delivered; and many such like things you do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And having called near all the multitude, he said to them, 'Hearken to me, you all, and understand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>there is nothing from without the man entering into him that is able to defile him, but the things coming out from him, those are the things defiling the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>If any has ears to hear -- let him hear.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>And when he entered into a house from the multitude, his disciples were questioning him about the simile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>and he said to them, 'So also you are without understanding! Do you not perceive that nothing from without entering into the man is able to defile him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it does not enter into his heart, but into the belly, and into the drain it does go out, purifying all the meats.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>And he said -- 'That which is coming out from the man, that does defile the man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>for from within, out of the heart of men, the evil reasonings do come forth, adulteries, whoredoms, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>thefts, covetous desires, wickedness, deceit, arrogance, an evil eye, evil speaking, pride, foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>all these evils do come forth from within, and they defile the man.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>And from thence having risen, he went away to the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and having entered into the house, he wished none to know, and he was not able to be hid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>for a woman having heard about him, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having come, fell at his feet, --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>and the woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by nation -- and was asking him, that the demon he may cast forth out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>And Jesus said to her, 'Allow first the children to be filled, for it is not good to take the children's bread, and to castit to the little dogs.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>And she answered and said to him, 'Yes, sir; for the little dogs also under the table do eat of the children's crumbs.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>And he said to her, 'Because of this word go; the demon has gone forth out of your daughter;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>and having come away to her house, she found the demon gone forth, and the daughter laid upon the couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>And again, having gone forth from the coasts of Tyre and Sidon, he came unto the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the coasts of Decapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>and they bring to him a deaf, stuttering man, and they call on him that he may put the hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And having taken him away from the multitude by himself, he put his fingers to his ears, and having spit, he touched his tongue,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>And his disciples answered him, 'Whence shall any one be able these here to feed with bread in a wilderness?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he was questioning them, 'How many loaves have you?' and they said, 'Seven.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>And he commanded the multitude to sit down upon the ground, and having taken the seven loaves, having given thanks, he brake, and was giving to his disciples that they may set before them; and they did set before the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few small fishes, and having blessed, he said to set them also before them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>and they did eat and were filled, and they took up that which was over of broken pieces -- seven baskets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>and those eating were about four thousand. And he let them away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>and immediately having entered into the boat with his disciples, he came to the parts of Dalmanutha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>and the Pharisees came forth, and began to dispute with him, seeking from him a sign from the heaven, tempting him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>and having sighed deeply in his spirit, he said, 'Why does this generation seek after a sign? Verily I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And having left them, having entered again into the boat, he went away to the other side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>and they forgot to take loaves, and except one loaf they had nothing with them in the boat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>and he was charging them, saying, 'Take heed, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>and they were reasoning with one another, saying -- 'Because we have no loaves.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Afterwards again he put his hands on his eyes, and made him look up, and he was restored, and discerned all things clearly,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>And he strictly charged them that they may tell no one about it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>and began to teach them, that it is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>and openly he was speaking the word. And Peter having taken him aside, began to rebuke him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.43'>And immediately -- while he is yet speaking -- comes near Judas, one of the twelve, and with him a great multitude, with swords and sticks, from the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.44'>and he who is delivering him up had given a token to them, saying, 'Whomsoever I shall kiss, he it is, lay hold on him, and lead him away safely,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.45'>and having come, immediately, having gone near him, he said, 'Rabbi, Rabbi,' and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>And they laid on him their hands, and kept hold on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>and a certain one of those standing by, having drawn the sword, struck the servant of the chief priest, and took off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>And Jesus answering said to them, 'As against a robber you came out, with swords and sticks, to take me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>daily I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not lay hold on me -- but that the Writings may be fulfilled.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>And having left him they all fled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>and a certain young man was following him, having put a linen cloth about his naked body, and the young men lay hold on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>and he, having left the linen cloth, did flee from them naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>And they led away Jesus unto the chief priest, and come together to him do all the chief priests, and the elders, and the scribes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>and Peter afar off did follow him, to the inside of the hall of the chief priest, and he was sitting with the officers, and warming himself near the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>And the chief priests and all the sanhedrin were seeking against Jesus testimony -- to put him to death, and they were not finding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>for many were bearing false testimony against him, and their testimonies were not alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>And certain having risen up, were bearing false testimony against him, saying --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>'We heard him saying -- I will throw down this sanctuary made with hands, and by three days, another made without hands I will build;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>and neither so was their testimony alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And the chief priest, having risen up in the midst, questioned Jesus, saying, 'You do not answer anything! what do these testify against you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>and he was keeping silent, and did not answer anything. Again the chief priest was questioning him, and said to him, 'Are you the Christ -- the Son of the Blessed?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>and Jesus said, 'I am; and you shall see the Son of Man sitting on the right hand of the power, and coming with the clouds, of the heaven.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>And the chief priest, having rent his garments, said, 'What need have we yet of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You heard the evil speaking, what appears to you?' and they all condemned him to be worthy of death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>and certain began to spit on him, and to cover his face, and to buffet him, and to say to him, 'Prophesy;' and the officers were striking him with their palms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And Peter being in the hall beneath, there does come one of the maids of the chief priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>and having seen Peter warming himself, having looked on him, she said, 'And you were with Jesus of Nazareth!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>and he denied, saying, 'I have not known him, neither do I understand what you say;' and he went forth without to the porch, and a cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the maid having seen him again, began to say to those standing near -- 'This is of them;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>and he was again denying. And after a little again, those standing near said to Peter, 'Truly you are of them, for you also are a Galilean, and your speech is alike;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>and he began to anathematize, and to swear -- 'I have not known this man of whom you speak;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>and a second time a cock crew, and Peter remembered the saying that Jesus said to him -- 'Before a cock crow twice, you may deny me thrice;' and having thought thereon -- he was weeping.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And immediately, in the morning, the chief priests having made a consultation, with the elders, and scribes, and the whole sanhedrin, having bound Jesus, did lead away, and delivered him to Pilate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>and Pilate questioned him, 'Are you the king of the Jews?' and he answering said to him, 'You do sayit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests were accusing him of many things, but he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>And Pilate again questioned him, saying, 'You do not answer anything! lo, how many things they do testify against you!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>and Jesus did no more answer anything, so that Pilate wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>And at every feast he was releasing to them one prisoner, whomsoever they were asking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>and there was one named Barabbas, bound with those making insurrection with him, who had in the insurrection committed murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the multitude having cried out, began to ask for themselves as he was always doing to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>and Pilate answered them, saying, 'Will you that I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>for he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered him up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>and the chief priests did move the multitude, that he might rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>And Pilate answering, again said to them, 'What, then, will you that I shall do to him whom you call king of the Jews?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>and they again cried out, 'Crucify him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate said to them, 'Why -- what evil did he?' and they cried out the more vehemently, 'Crucify him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>and Pilate, wishing to content the multitude, released to them Barabbas, and delivered up Jesus -- having scourged him -- that he might be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him away into the hall, which is Praetorium, and call together the whole band,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>and clothe him with purple, and having plaited a crown of thorns, they put it on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and began to salute him, 'Hail, King of the Jews.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they were smiting him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and having bent the knee, were bowing to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>and when they had mocked him, they took the purple from off him, and clothed him in his own garments, and they led him forth, that they may crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they impress a certain one passing by -- Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the field, the father of Alexander and Rufus -- that he may bear his cross,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>and they bring him to the place Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, 'Place of a skull;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>and they were giving him to drink wine mingled with myrrh, and he did not receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And having crucified him, they were dividing his garments, casting a lot upon them, what each may take;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>and the inscription of his accusation was written above -- 'The King of the Jews.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucify two robbers, one on the right hand, and one on his left,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those passing by were speaking evil of him, shaking their heads, and saying, 'Ah, the thrower down of the sanctuary, and in three days the builder!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself, and come down from the cross!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>And in like manner also the chief priests, mocking with one another, with the scribes, said, 'Others he saved; himself he is not able to save.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And the sixth hour having come, darkness came over the whole land till the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>and at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a great voice, saying, 'Eloi, Eloi, lamma sabachthani?' which is, being interpreted, 'My God, my God, why did You forsake me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And certain of those standing by, having heard, said, 'Lo, Elijah he does call;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>and one having run, and having filled a spunge with vinegar, having put it also on a reed, was giving him to drink, saying, 'Let alone, let us see if Elijah does come to take him down.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus having uttered a loud cry, yielded the spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>and the veil of the sanctuary was rent in two, from top to bottom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>and the centurion who was standing across from him, having seen that, having so cried out, he yielded the spirit, said, 'Truly this man was Son of God.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, an honourable counsellor, who also himself was waiting for the reign of God, came, boldly entered in unto Pilate, and asked the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate wondered if he were already dead, and having called near the centurion, did question him if he were long dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>and having known it from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And he, having brought fine linen, and having taken him down, wrapped him in the linen, and laid him in a sepulchre that had been hewn out of a rock, and he rolled a stone unto the door of the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>and Mary the Magdalene, and Mary of Joses, were beholding where he is laid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>and they said among themselves, 'Who shall roll away for us the stone out of the door of the sepulchre?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And having looked, they see that the stone has been rolled away -- for it was very great,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>and having entered into the sepulchre, they saw a young man sitting on the right hand, arrayed in a long white robe, and they were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>And he said to them, 'Be not amazed, you seek Jesus the Nazarene, the crucified: he did rise -- he is not here; lo, the place where they laid him!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And, having come forth quickly, they fled from the sepulchre, and trembling and amazement had seized them, and to no one said they anything, for they were afraid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>and they, having heard that he is alive, and was seen by her, did not believe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterwards, as they are reclining (at meat), he was manifested to the eleven, and did reproach their unbelief and stiffness of heart, because they believed not those having seen him being raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>and he said to them, 'Having gone to all the world, proclaim the good news to all the creation;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Seeing that many did take in hand to set in order a narration of the matters that have been fully assured among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>as they did deliver to us, who from the beginning became eye-witnesses, and officers of the Word, --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good also to me, having followed from the first after all things exactly, to write to you in order, most noble Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that you may know the certainty of the things wherein you were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest, by name Zacharias, of the course of Abijah, and his wife of the daughters of Aaron, and her name Elizabeth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>and they were both righteous before God, going on in all the commands and righteousnesses of the Lord blameless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>and they had no child, because that Elizabeth was barren, and both were advanced in their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it came to pass, in his acting as priest, in the order of his course before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood, his lot was to make perfume, having gone into the sanctuary of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>and all the multitude of the people were praying without, at the hour of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him a messenger of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of the perfume,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>and Zacharias, having seen, was troubled, and fear fell on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>and the messenger said unto him, 'Fear not, Zacharias, for your supplication was heard, and your wife Elizabeth shall bear a son to you, and you shall call his name John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>and there shall be joy to you, and gladness, and many at his birth shall joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>for he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and strong drink he may not drink, and of the Holy Spirit he shall be full, even from his mother's womb;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>and he shall go before Him, in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn hearts of fathers unto children, and disobedient ones to the wisdom of righteous ones, to make ready for the Lord, a people prepared.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said unto the messenger, 'Whereby shall I know this? for I am aged, and my wife is advanced in her days?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the messenger answering said to him, 'I am Gabriel, who have been standing near before God, and I was sent to speak unto you, and to proclaim these good news to you,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zacharias, and wondering at his tarrying in the sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>and having come out, he was not able to speak to them, and they perceived that a vision he had seen in the sanctuary, and he was beckoning to them, and did remain dumb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, when the days of his service were fulfilled, he went away to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>and after those days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>'Thus has the Lord done to me, in days in which He looked upon me, to take away my reproach among men.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month was the messenger Gabriel sent by God, to a city of Galilee, the name of which is Nazareth,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the messenger answering said to her, 'The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow you, therefore also the holy-begotten thing shall be called Son of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>and lo, Elizabeth, your kinswoman, she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month to her who was called barren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>because nothing shall be impossible with God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, 'Lo, the maid-servant of the Lord; let it be to me according to your saying,' and the messenger went away from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary having arisen in those days, went to the hill-country, with haste, to a city of Judea,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, when Elizabeth heard the salutation of Mary, the babe did leap in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and spake out with a loud voice, and said, 'Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>and whence is this to me, that the mother of my Lord might come unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>for, lo, when the voice of your salutation came to my ears, leap in gladness did the babe in my womb;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The hungry He did fill with good, And the rich He sent away empty,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He received again Israel His servant, To remember kindness,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>and having seen Jesus, and having cried out, he fell before him, and with a loud voice, said, 'What -- to me and to you, Jesus, Son of God Most High? I beseech you, may you not afflict me!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man, for many times it had caught him, and he was being bound with chains and fetters -- guarded, and breaking asunder the bonds he was driven by the demons to the deserts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jesus questioned him, saying, 'What is your name?' and he said, 'Legion,' (because many demons were entered into him,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>and he was calling on him, that he may not command them to go away to the abyss,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>and there was there a herd of many swine feeding in the mountain, and they were calling on him, that he might suffer them to enter into these, and he suffered them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>and those also having seen it, told them how the demoniac was saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And the whole multitude of the region of the Gadarenes round about asked him to go away from them, because with great fear they were pressed, and he having entered into the boat, did turn back.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>and a woman, having an issue of blood for twelve years, who, having spent on physicians all her living, was not able to be healed by any,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>having come near behind, touched the fringe of his garment, and presently the issue of her blood stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, 'Whois it that touched me?' and all denying, Peter and those with him said, 'Master, the multitudes press you, and throng you, and you do say, Whois it that touched me!'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And the woman, having seen that she was not hid, trembling, came, and having fallen before him, for what cause she touched him declared to him before all the people, and how she was healed presently;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>and he said to her, 'Take courage, daughter, your faith has saved you, be going on to peace.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he is yet speaking, there does come a certain one from the chief of the synagogue's house, saying to him -- 'Your daughter has died, harass not the Teacher;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>and Jesus having heard, answered him, saying, 'Be not afraid, only believe, and she shall be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>And having come to the house, he suffered no one to go in, except Peter, and James, and John, and the father of the child, and the mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>and they were all weeping, and beating themselves for her, and he said, 'Weep not, she did not die, but does sleep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>and they were deriding him, knowing that she did die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>and he having put all forth without, and having taken hold of her hand, called, saying, 'Child, arise;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>and her spirit came back, and she arose presently, and he directed that there be given to her to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>and her parents were amazed, but he charged them to say to no one what was come to pass.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>And having called together his twelve disciples, he gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to cure sicknesses,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said unto them, 'Take nothing for the way, neither staff, nor scrip, nor bread, nor money; neither have two coats each;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>And Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things being done by him, and was perplexed, because it was said by certain, that John has been raised out of the dead;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>and Herod said, 'John I did behead, but who is this concerning whom I hear such things?' and he was seeking to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>And the apostles having turned back, declared to him how great things they did, and having taken them, he withdrew by himself to a desert place of a city called Bethsaida,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>and the multitudes having known did follow him, and having received them, he was speaking to them concerning the reign of God, and those having need of service he cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>And the day began to decline, and the twelve having come near, said to him, 'Let away the multitude, that having gone to the villages and the fields round about, they may lodge and may find provision, because here we are in a desert place.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>And he said unto them, 'Give you them to eat;' and they said, 'We have no more than five loaves, and two fishes: except, having gone, we may buy for all this people victuals;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>for they were about five thousand men. And he said unto his disciples, 'Cause them to recline in companies, in each fifty;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>and they did so, and made all to recline;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>and having taken the five loaves, and the two fishes, having looked up to the heaven, he blessed them, and brake, and was giving to the disciples to set before the multitude;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>and they did eat, and were all filled, and there was taken up what was over to them of broken pieces, twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>And it came to pass, as he is praying alone, the disciples were with him, and he questioned them, saying, 'Who do the multitudes say me to be?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>And they answering said, 'John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and others, that a prophet, one of the ancients, was risen;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>and he said to them, 'And you -- who do ye say me to be?' and Peter answering said, 'The Christ of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>And having charged them, he commanded them to say this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying -- 'It is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders, and chief priests, and scribes, and to be killed, and the third day to be raised.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And he said unto all, 'If any one does will to come after me, let him disown himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>for whoever may will to save his life, shall lose it, and whoever may lose his life for my sake, he shall save it;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>And it came to pass, after these words, as it were eight days, that having taken Peter, and John, and James, he went up to the mountain to pray,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>and it came to pass, in his praying, the appearance of his face became altered, and his garment white -- sparkling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And lo, two men were speaking together with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who having appeared in glory, spake of his outgoing that he was about to fulfil in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>but Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep, and having waked, they saw his glory, and the two men standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it came to pass, in their parting from him, Peter said unto Jesus, 'Master, it is good to us to be here; and we may make three booths, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah,' not knowing what he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>and as he was speaking these things, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them, and they feared in their entering into the cloud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>and a voice came out of the cloud saying, 'This is My Son -- the Beloved; hear you him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>and when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone; and they were silent, and declared to no one in those days anything of what they have seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>And it came to pass on the next day, they having come down from the mount, there met him a great multitude,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>and lo, a man from the multitude cried out, saying, 'Teacher, I beseech you, look upon my son, because he is my only begotten;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>and lo, a spirit does take him, and suddenly he does cry out, and it tears him, with foaming, and it hardly departs from him, bruising him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>and I besought your disciples that they might cast it out, and they were not able.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>And Jesus answering said, 'O generation, unstedfast and perverse, till when shall I be with you, and suffer you? bring near hither your son;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>and as he is yet coming near, the demon rent him, and tore him sore, and Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the youth, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the greatness of God, and while all are wondering at all things that Jesus did, he said unto his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>'Lay you to your ears these words, for the Son of Man is about to be delivered up to the hands of men.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>And they were not knowing this saying, and it was veiled from them, that they might not perceive it, and they were afraid to ask him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>And there entered a reasoning among them, this, Who may be greater of them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>and Jesus having seen the reasoning of their heart, having taken hold of a child, set him beside himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, 'Whoever may receive this child in my name, does receive me, and whoever may receive me, does receive Him who sent me, for he who is least among you all -- he shall be great.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And John answering said, 'Master, we saw a certain one in your name casting forth the demons, and we forbade him, because he does not follow with us;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>and Jesus said unto him, 'Forbid not, for he who is not against us, is for us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>And it came to pass, in the completing of the days of his being taken up, that he fixed his face to go on to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and he sent messengers before his face, and having gone on, they went into a village of Samaritans, to make ready for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>and they did not receive him, because his face was going on to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And his disciples James and John having seen, said, 'Sir, will you that we may command fire to come down from the heaven, and to consume them, as also Elijah did?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>and having turned, he rebuked them, and said, 'You have not known of what spirit you are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>for the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives, but to save;' and they went on to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And it came to pass, as they are going on in the way, a certain one said unto him, 'I will follow you wherever you may go, sir;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>and Jesus said to him, 'The foxes have holes, and the fowls of the heaven places of rest, but the Son of Man has not where he may recline the head.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said unto another, 'Be following me;' and he said, 'Sir, permit me, having gone away, first to bury my father;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>and Jesus said to him, 'Suffer the dead to bury their own dead, and you, having gone away, publish the reign of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, 'I will follow you, sir, but first permit me to take leave of those in my house;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>and Jesus said unto him, 'No one having put his hand on a plough, and looking back, is fit for the reign of God.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>yet because this widow does give me trouble, I will do her justice, lest, perpetually coming, she may plague me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>And the Lord said, 'Hear you what the unrighteous judge said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>and shall not God execute the justice to His choice ones, who are crying unto Him day and night -- bearing long in regard to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I say to you, that He will execute the justice to them quickly; but the Son of Man having come, shall he find the faith upon the earth?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>And he spake also unto certain who have been trusting in themselves that they were righteous, and have been despising the rest, this simile:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>'Two men went up to the temple to pray, the one a Pharisee, and the other a tax-gatherer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>the Pharisee having stood by himself, thus prayed: God, I thank You that I am not as the rest of men, rapacious, unrighteous, adulterers, or even as this tax-gatherer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice in the week, I give tithes of all things -- as many as I possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>'And the tax-gatherer, having stood afar off, would not even the eyes lift up to the heaven, but was smiting on his breast, saying, God be propitious to me -- the sinner!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I say to you, this one went down declared righteous, to his house, rather than that one: for every one who is exalting himself shall be humbled, and he who is humbling himself shall be exalted.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>And they were bringing near also the babes, that he may touch them, and the disciples having seen did rebuke them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>and Jesus having called them near, said, 'Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the reign of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>verily I say to you, Whoever may not receive the reign of God as a little child, may not enter into it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>And a certain ruler questioned him, saying, 'Good teacher, what having done -- shall I inherit life age-during?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>And Jesus said to him, 'Why me do you call good? no oneis good, except One -- God;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>And he said, 'All these I did keep from my youth;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>and having heard these things, Jesus said to him, 'Yet one thing to you is lacking; all things -- as many as you have -- sell, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven, and come, be following me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>and he, having heard these things, became very sorrowful, for he was exceeding rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>And Jesus having seen him become very sorrowful, said, 'How hardly shall those having riches enter into the reign of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>for it is easier for a camel through the eye of a needle to enter, than for a rich man into the reign of God to enter.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>And those who heard, said, 'And who is able to be saved?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>and he said, 'The things impossible with men are possible with God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>And Peter said, 'Lo, we left all, and did follow you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>and he said to them, 'Verily I say to you, that there is not one who left house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, for the sake of the reign of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>who may not receive back manifold more in this time, and in the coming age, life age-during.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>And having taken the twelve aside, he said unto them, 'Lo, we go up to Jerusalem, and all things shall be completed -- that have been written through the prophets -- to the Son of Man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>for he shall be delivered up to the nations, and shall be mocked, and insulted, and spit upon,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>And they none of these things understood, and this saying was hid from them, and they were not knowing the things said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>And it came to pass, in his coming near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting beside the way begging,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>and having heard a multitude going by, he was inquiring what this may be,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>and they brought him word that Jesus the Nazarene does pass by,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>and he cried out, saying, 'Jesus, Son of David, deal kindly with me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>and those going before were rebuking him, that he might be silent, but he was much more crying out, 'Son of David, deal kindly with me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>And Jesus having stood, commanded him to be brought unto him, and he having come near, he questioned him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>saying, 'What will you I shall do to you?' and he said, 'Sir, that I may receive sight.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>And Jesus said to him, 'Receive your sight; your faith has saved you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>and presently he did receive sight, and was following him, glorifying God; and all the people, having seen, did give praise to God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>And having entered, he was passing through Jericho,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>and lo, a man, by name called Zaccheus, and he was a chief tax-gatherer, and he was rich,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>and he was seeking to see Jesus, who he is, and was not able for the multitude, because in stature he was small,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>and having run forward before, he went up on a sycamore, that he may see him, because through that way he was about to pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And as Jesus came up to the place, having looked up, he saw him, and said unto him, 'Zaccheus, having hastened, come down, for to-day in your house it is necessary for me to remain;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>and he having hastened did come down, and did receive him rejoicing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>and having seen it, they were all murmuring, saying -- 'With a sinful man he went in to lodge!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>And Zaccheus having stood, said unto the Lord, 'Lo, the half of my goods, sir, I give to the poor, and if of any one anything I did take by false accusation, I give back fourfold.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said unto him -- 'To-day salvation did come to this house, inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the lost.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>And while they are hearing these things, having added he spake a simile, because of his being near to Jerusalem, and of their thinking that the reign of God is about presently to be made manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>He said therefore, 'A certain man of birth went on to a far country, to take to himself a kingdom, and to return,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>and having called ten servants of his own, he gave to them ten pounds, and said unto them, Do business -- till I come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>and his citizens were hating him, and did send an embassy after him, saying, We do not wish this one to reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>'And it came to pass, on his coming back, having taken the kingdom, that he commanded these servants to be called to him, to whom he gave the money, that he might know what any one had done in business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>'And the first came near, saying, Sir, your pound did gain ten pounds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>and he said to him, Well done, good servant, because in a very little you did become faithful, be having authority over ten cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>'And the second came, saying, Sir, your pound made five pounds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>and he said also to this one, And you, become you over five cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>'And another came, saying, Sir, lo, your pound, that I had lying away in a napkin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>for I was afraid of you, because you are an austere man; you take up what you did not lay down, and reap what you did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>'And he said to him, Out of your mouth I will judge you, evil servant: you knew that I am an austere man, taking up what I did not lay down, and reaping what I did not sow!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>and wherefore did you not give my money to the bank, and I, having come, with interest might have received it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>'And to those standing by he said, Take from him the pound, and give to him having the ten pounds --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>(and they said to him, Sir, he has ten pounds) --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>for I say to you, that to every one having shall be given, and from him not having, also what he has shall be taken from him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>but those my enemies, who did not wish me to reign over them, bring hither and slay before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>And having said these things, he went on before, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>And it came to pass, as he came near to Bethphage and Bethany, unto the mount called of the Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>having said, Go away to the village oppositeyou, in which, entering into, you shall find a colt bound, on which no one of men did ever sit, having loosed it, bring it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>and if any one does question you, Therefore do you looseit? thus you shall say to him -- The Lord has need of it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>And those sent, having gone away, found according as he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>and while they are loosing the colt, its owners said unto them, 'Why loose you the colt?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>and they said, 'The Lord has need of it;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>and they brought it unto Jesus, and having cast their garments upon the colt, they did set Jesus upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as he is going, they were spreading their garments in the way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>and as he is coming near now, at the descent of the mount of the Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a great voice for all the mighty works they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying, 'blessed is he who is coming, a king in the name of the Lord; peace in heaven, and glory in the highest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>And certain of the Pharisees from the multitude said unto him, 'Teacher, rebuke your disciples;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>and he answering said to them, 'I say to you, that, if these shall be silent, the stones will cry out!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And when he came near, having seen the city, he wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying -- 'If you did know, even you, at least in this your day, the things for your peace; but now they were hid from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>'Because days shall come upon you, and your enemies shall cast around you a rampart, and compass you round, and press you on every side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>and lay you low, and your children within you, and they shall not leave in you a stone upon a stone, because you did not know the time of your inspection.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>And having entered into the temple, he began to cast forth those selling in it, and those buying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>saying to them, 'It has been written, My house is a house of prayer -- but you made it a den of robbers.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And he was teaching daily in the temple, but the chief priests and the scribes were seeking to destroy him -- also the chiefs of the people --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>and they were not finding what they shall do, for all the people were hanging on him, hearing him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And it came to pass, on one of those days, as he is teaching the people in the temple, and proclaiming good news, the chief priests and the scribes, with the elders, came upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and spake unto him, saying, 'Tell us by what authority you do these things? or who is he that gave to you this authority?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>And he answering said unto them, 'I will question you -- I also -- one thing, and tell me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>the baptism of John, from heaven was it, or from men?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they reasoned with themselves, saying -- 'If we may say, From heaven, he will say, Therefore, then, did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>and if we may say, From men, all the people will stone us, for they are having been persuaded John to be a prophet.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they answered, that they knew not whence it was,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>and Jesus said to them, 'Neither do I say to you by what authority I do these things.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to speak unto the people this simile: 'A certain man planted a vineyard, and gave it out to husbandmen, and went abroad for a long time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>and at the season he sent unto the husbandmen a servant, that from the fruit of the vineyard they may give to him, but the husbandmen having beat him, did sendhim away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>'And he added to send another servant, and they that one also having beaten and dishonoured, did send away empty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>and he added to send a third, and this one also, having wounded, they did cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>'And the owner of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my son -- the beloved, perhaps having seen this one, they will do reverence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>and having seen him, the husbandmen reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir; come, we may kill him, that the inheritance may become ours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>and having cast him outside of the vineyard, they killedhim; what, then, shall the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come, and destroy these husbandmen, and will give the vineyard to others.' And having heard, they said, 'Let it not be!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>and he, having looked upon them, said, 'What, then, is this that has been written: A stone that the builders rejected -- this became head of a corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>every one who has fallen on that stone shall be broken, and on whom it may fall, it will crush him to pieces.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on him in that hour, and they feared the people, for they knew that against them he spake this simile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And, having watched him, they sent forth liers in wait, feigning themselves to be righteous, that they might take hold of his word, to deliver him up to the rule and to the authority of the governor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>and they questioned him, saying, 'Teacher, we have known that you do say and teach rightly, and do not accept a person, but in truth the way of God do teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful to us to give tribute to Caesar or not?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>And he, having perceived their craftiness, said unto them, 'Why me do you tempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>show me a denary; of whom has it an image and superscription?' and they answering said, 'Of Caesar:'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>and he said to them, 'Give back, therefore, the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>and they were not able to take hold on his saying before the people, and having wondered at his answer, they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>And certain of the Sadducees, who are denying that there is a rising again, having come near, questioned him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying, 'Teacher, Moses wrote to us, If any one's brother may die, having a wife, and he may die childless -- that his brother may take the wife, and may raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>'There were, then, seven brothers, and the first having taken a wife, died childless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>and the second took the wife, and he died childless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and the third took her, and in like manner also the seven -- they left not children, and they died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>and last of all died also the woman:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>in the rising again, then, of which of them does she become wife? -- for the seven had her as wife.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answering said to them, 'The sons of this age do marry and are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those accounted worthy to obtain that age, and the rising again that is out of the dead, neither marry, nor are they given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for neither are they able to die any more -- for they are like messengers -- and they are sons of God, being sons of the rising again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>'And that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the Bush, since he does call the Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>and He is not a God of dead men, but of living, for all live to Him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And certain of the scribes answering said, 'Teacher, you did say well;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>and no more did they question him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said unto them, 'How do they say the Christ to be son of David,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>and they rejoiced, and covenanted to give him money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>and he agreed, and was seeking a favourable season to deliver him up to them without tumult.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And the Lord having turned did look on Peter, and Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how he said to him -- 'Before a cock shall crow, you may disown me thrice;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>and Peter having gone without, wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>And the men who were holding Jesus were mocking him, beating him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>and having blindfolded him, they were striking him on the face, and were questioning him, saying, 'Prophesy who he is who smote you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>and many other things, speaking evilly, they spake in regard to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>And when it became day there was gathered together the eldership of the people, chief priests also, and scribes, and they led him up to their own sanhedrin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>saying, 'If you be the Christ, tell us.' And he said to them, 'If I may tell you, you will not believe;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>And Pilate having heard of Galilee, questioned if the man is a Galilean,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and the scribes stood vehemently accusing him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>and Herod with his soldiers having set him at nought, and having mocked, having put around him gorgeous apparel, did send him back to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>and both Pilate and Herod became friends on that day with one another, for they were before at enmity between themselves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said unto them, 'You brought to me this man as perverting the people, and lo, I before you having examined, found in this man no fault in those things you bring forward against him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>no, nor yet Herod, for I sent you back unto him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is having been done by him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>having chastised, therefore, I will release him,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>for it was necessary for him to release to them one at every feast,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>who had been, because of a certain sedition made in the city, and murder, cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate again then -- wishing to release Jesus -- called to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they were calling out, saying, 'Crucify, crucify him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he a third time said unto them, 'Why, what evil did he? no cause of death did I find in him; having chastised him, then, I will release him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>And they were pressing with loud voices asking him to be crucified, and their voices, and those of the chief priests, were prevailing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>and Pilate gave judgment for their request being done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>and he released him who because of sedition and murder has been cast into the prison, whom they were asking, and Jesus he gave up to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, having taken hold on Simon, a certain Cyrenian, coming from the field, they put on him the cross, to bear it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there was following him a great multitude of the people, and of women, who also were beating themselves and lamenting him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And mocking him also were the soldiers, coming near and offering vinegar to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, 'If you be the king of the Jews, save yourself.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also a superscription written over him, in letters of Greek, and Roman, and Hebrew, 'This is the King of the Jews.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>And Peter having risen, did run to the tomb, and having stooped down he sees the linen clothes lying alone, and he went away to his own home, wondering at that which was come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And, lo, two of them were going on during that day to a village, distant sixty furlongs from Jerusalem, the name of which is Emmaus,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>and he said unto them, 'Whatare these words that you exchange with one another, walking, and you are sad?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And the one, whose name was Cleopas, answering, said unto him, 'Are you alone such a stranger in Jerusalem, that you have not known the things that came to pass in it in these days?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, 'What things?' And they said to him, 'The things about Jesus of Nazareth, who became a man -- a prophet -- powerful in deed and word, before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>how also the chief priests and our rulers did deliver him up to a judgment of death, and crucified him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>and we were hoping that he it is who is about to redeem Israel, and also with all these things, this third day is passing to-day, since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>'And certain women of ours also astonished us, coming early to the tomb,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>and certain of those with us went away unto the tomb, and found as even the women said, and him they saw not.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And he said unto them, 'O inconsiderate and slow in heart, to believe on all that the prophets spake!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was it not behooving the Christ these things to suffer, and to enter into his glory?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>and having begun from Moses, and from all the prophets, he was expounding to them in all the Writings the things about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they came near to the village whither they were going, and he made an appearance of going on further,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>and they constrained him, saying, 'Remain with us, for it is toward evening,' and the day did decline, and he went in to remain with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass, in his reclining (at meat) with them, having taken the bread, he blessed, and having broken, he was giving to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>and their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became unseen by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, 'Was not our heart burning within us, as he was speaking to us in the way, and as he was opening up to us the Writings?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they, having risen up the same hour, turned back to Jerusalem, and found gathered together the eleven, and those with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying -- 'The Lord was raised indeed, and was seen by Simon;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>and they were telling the things in the way, and how he was made known to them in the breaking of the bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>and as they are speaking these things, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, 'Peace -- to you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>and being amazed, and becoming affrighted, they were thinking themselves to see a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, 'Why are you troubled? and wherefore do reasonings come up in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>see my hands and my feet, that I am he; handle me and see, because a spirit has not flesh and bones, as you see me having.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And having said this, he showed to them the hands and the feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>and while they are not believing from the joy, and wondering, he said to them, 'Have you anything here to eat?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>and they gave to him part of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and having taken, he did eat before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>and he said to them, 'Theseare the words that I spake unto you, being yet with you, that it is necessary for to be fulfilled all the things that are written in the Law of Moses, and the Prophets, and the Psalms, about me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then opened he up their understanding to understand the Writings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and he said to them -- 'Thus it has been written, and thus it was behooving the Christ to suffer, and to rise out of the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and reformation and remission of sins to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>and you -- you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>'And, lo, I do send the promise of my Father upon you, but you -- abide you in the city of Jerusalem till you be clothed with power from on high.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>and it came to pass, in his blessing them, he was parted from them, and was borne up to the heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>and they, having bowed before him, did turn back to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>this one was in the beginning with God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>all things through him did happen, and without him happened not even one thing that has happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>and the light in the darkness did shine, and the darkness did not perceive it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There came a man -- having been sent from God -- whose name is John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>this one came for testimony, that he might testify about the Light, that all might believe through him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>that one was not the Light, but -- that he might testify about the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>He was the true Light, which does enlighten every man, coming to the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>in the world he was, and the world through him was made, and the world did not know him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>to his own things he came, and his own people did not receive him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>but as many as did receive him to them he gave authority to become sons of God -- to those believing in his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who -- not of blood nor of a will of flesh, nor of a will of man but -- of God were begotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh, and did tabernacle among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of an only begotten of a father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John does testify concerning him, and has cried, saying, 'This was he of whom I said, He who after me is coming, has come before me, for he was before me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>and out of his fulness did we all receive, and grace over-against grace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>for the law through Moses was given, the grace and the truth through Jesus Christ did come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>God no one has ever seen; the only begotten Son, who is on the bosom of the Father -- he did declare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent out of Jerusalem priests and Levites, that they might question him, 'Who are you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>and he confessed and did not deny, and confessed -- 'I am not the Christ.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they questioned him, 'What then? Elijah are you?' and he said, 'I am not.' -- 'The prophet are you?' and he answered, 'No.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said then to him, 'Who are you, that we may give an answer to those sending us? what do you say concerning yourself?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, 'I am a voice of one crying in the wilderness: Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And those sent were of the Pharisees,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>and they questioned him and said to him, 'Why, then, do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, 'I baptize with water, but in midst of you he has stood whom you have not known, this one it is who is coming after me, who has been before me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>of whom I am not worthy that I may loose the cord of his sandal.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things came to pass in Bethabara, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>on the morrow John sees Jesus coming unto him, and said, 'Lo, the Lamb of God, who is taking away the sin of the world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>this is he concerning whom I said, After me does come a man, who has come before me, because he was before me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>and I knew him not, but, that he might be manifested to Israel, because of this I came with the water baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John testified, saying -- 'I have seen the Spirit coming down, as a dove, out of heaven, and it remained on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>and I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water, He said to me, On whomsoever you mayest see the Spirit coming down, and remaining on him, this is he who is baptizing with the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>and I have seen, and have testified, that this is the Son of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>On the morrow, again, John was standing, and two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and having looked on Jesus walking, he said, 'Lo, the Lamb of God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>and the two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus having turned, and having beheld them following, said to them, 'What seek you?' and they said to them, 'Rabbi, (which is, being interpreted, Teacher,) where remain you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, 'Come and see;' they came, and saw where he does remain, and with him they remained that day and the hour was about the tenth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, was one of the two who heard from John, and followed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>this one does first find his own brother Simon, and said to him, 'We have found the Messiah,' (which is, being interpreted, The Anointed,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>and he brought him unto Jesus: and having looked upon him, Jesus said, 'You are Simon, the son of Jonas, you shall be called Cephas,' (which is interpreted, A rock.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the morrow, he willed to go forth to Galilee, and he finds Philip, and said to him, 'Be following me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>And Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip finds Nathanael, and said to him, 'Him of whom Moses wrote in the Law, and the prophets, we have found, Jesus the son of Joseph, who is from Nazareth;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming unto him, and he said concerning him, 'Lo, truly an Israelite, in whom guile is not;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to him, 'Whence me do you know?' Jesus answered and said to him, 'Before Philip's calling you -- you being under the fig-tree -- I saw you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to him, 'Rabbi, you are the Son of God, you are the king of Israel.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, 'Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig-tree, you do believe; greater things than these you shall see;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>and he said to him, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, henceforth you shall see the heaven opened, and the messengers of God going up and coming down upon the Son of Man.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day a marriage happened in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and also Jesus was called, and his disciples, to the marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>and wine having failed, the mother of Jesus said unto him, 'Wine they have not;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said to her, 'What -- to me and to you, woman? not yet is mine hour come.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the ministrants, 'Whatever he may say to you -- do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>And there were there six water-jugs of stone, placed according to the purifying of the Jews, holding each two or three measures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, 'Fill the water-jugs with water;' and they filled them -- unto the brim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>and he said to them, 'Draw out, now, and bear to the director of the apartment;' and they bare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And as the director of the apartment tasted the water become wine, and knew not whence it is, (but the ministrants knew, who have drawn the water,) the director of the feast does call the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, 'Every man, at first, the good wine does set forth; and when they may have drunk freely, then the inferior; you did keep the good wine till now.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of the signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory, and his disciples believed in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>after this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and his brethren, and his disciples; and there they remained not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>and he found in the temple those selling oxen, and sheep, and doves, and the money-changers sitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>and having made a whip of small cords, he put all forth out of the temple, also the sheep, and the oxen; and of the money-changers he poured out the coins, and the tables he overthrew,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and to those selling the doves he said, 'Take these things hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it is written, 'The zeal of Your house did eat me up;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>the Jews then answered and said to him, 'What sign do you show to us -- that you do these things?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said to them, 'Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will raise it up.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews, therefore, said, 'Forty and six years was this sanctuary building, and will you in three days raise it up?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>but he spake concerning the sanctuary of his body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>when, then, he was raised out of the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this to them, and they believed the Writing, and the word that Jesus said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>And as he was in Jerusalem, in the passover, in the feast, many believed in his name, beholding his signs that he was doing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>and Jesus himself was not trusting himself to them, because of his knowing all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and because he had no need that any should testify concerning man, for he himself was knowing what was in man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said to him, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, If any one may not be born from above, he is not able to see the reign of God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said unto him, 'How is a man able to be born, being old? is he able into the womb of his mother a second time to enter, and to be born?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, If any one may not be born of water, and the Spirit, he is not able to enter into the reign of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>that which has been born of the flesh is flesh, and that which has been born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>for God did so love the world, that His Son -- the only begotten -- He gave, that every one who is believing in him may not perish, but may have life age-during.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send His Son to the world that he may judge the world, but that the world may be saved through him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>he who is believing in him is not judged, but he who is not believing has been judged already, because he has not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and said to the woman -- 'No more because of your speaking do we believe; for we ourselves have heard and known that this is truly the Saviour of the world -- the Christ.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>And after the two days he went forth thence, and went away to Galilee,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus then said unto him, 'If signs and wonders you may not see, you will not believe.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The courtier said unto him, 'Sir, come down before my child die;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, 'Be going on; your son does live.' And the man believed the word that Jesus said to him, and was going on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>and he now going down, his servants met him, and told, saying -- 'Your child does live;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>he inquired then of them the hour in which he became better, and they said to him -- 'Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him;'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>and there is in Jerusalem by the sheep-gate a pool that is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>in these were lying a great multitude of the ailing, blind, lame, withered, waiting for the moving of the water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>for a messenger at a set time was going down in the pool, and was troubling the water, the first then having gone in after the troubling of the water, became whole of whatever sickness he was held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>and there was a certain man there being in ailment thirty and eight years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>him Jesus having seen lying, and having known that he is already a long time, he said to him, 'Do you wish to become whole?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The ailing man answered him, 'Sir, I have no man, that, when the water may be troubled, he may put me into the pool, and while I am coming, another does go down before me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, 'Rise, take up your couch, and be walking;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>and immediately the man became whole, and he took up his couch, and was walking, and it was a sabbath on that day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>the Jews then said to him that has been healed, 'It is a sabbath; it is not lawful to you to take up the couch.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, 'He who made me whole -- that one said to me, Take up your couch, and be walking;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>they questioned him, then, 'Who is the man who is saying to you, Take up your couch and be walking?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he that was healed had not known who he is, for Jesus did move away, a multitude being in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things, Jesus finds him in the temple, and said to him, 'Lo, you have become whole; sin no more, lest something worse may happen to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away, and told the Jews that it is Jesus who made him whole,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>and because of this were the Jews persecuting Jesus, and seeking to kill him, because these things he was doing on a sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>And Jesus answered them, 'My Father till now does work, and I work;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>because of this, then, were the Jews seeking the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the sabbath, but he also called God his own Father, making himself equal to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus therefore responded and said to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son is not able to do anything of himself, if he may not see the Father doing anything; for whatever things He may do, these also the Son in like manner does;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>for the Father does love the Son, and does show to him all things that He himself does; and greater works than these He will show him, that you may wonder.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>for neither does the Father judge any one, but all the judgment He has given to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all may honour the Son according as they honour the Father; he who is not honouring the Son, does not honour the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>'Verily, verily, I say to you -- He who is hearing my word, and is believing Him who sent me, has life age-during, and to judgment he does not come, but has passed out of the death to the life.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>for, as the Father has life in himself, so He gave also to the Son to have life in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and authority He gave him also to do judgment, because he is Son of Man.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>'I am not able of myself to do anything; according as I hear I judge, and my judgment is righteous, because I seek not my own will, but the will of the Father who sent me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>and he said, 'I believe, sir,' and bowed before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>And Jesus said, 'For judgment I to this world did come, that those not seeing may see, and those seeing may become blind.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>And those of the Pharisees who were with him heard these things, and they said to him, 'Are we also blind?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>'Verily, verily, I say to you, He who is not entering through the door to the fold of the sheep, but is going up from another side, that one is a thief and a robber;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.2'>and he who is entering through the door is shepherd of the sheep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'>to this one the doorkeeper does open, and the sheep hear his voice, and his own sheep he does call by name, and does lead them forth;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.6'>This similitude spake Jesus to them, and they knew not what the things were that he was speaking to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>Jesus said therefore again to them, 'Verily, verily, I say to you -- I am the door of the sheep;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>and the hireling does flee because he is an hireling, and is not caring for the sheep.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>Therefore, again, there came a division among the Jews, because of these words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>and many of them said, 'He has a demon, and is mad, why do you hear him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>others said, 'These sayings are not those of a demoniac; is a demon able blind men's eyes to open?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>and Jesus was walking in the temple, in the porch of Solomon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>the Jews, therefore, came round about him, and said to him, 'Till when our soul do you hold in suspense? if you are the Christ, tell us freely.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Jesus answered them, 'I told you, and you do not believe; the works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Therefore, again, did the Jews take up stones that they may stone him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus answered them, 'Many good works did I show you from my Father; because of which work of them do you stone me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, saying, 'For a good work we do not stone you, but for evil speaking, and because you, being a man, do make yourself God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, 'Is it not having been written in your law: I said, you are gods?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Therefore were they seeking again to seize him, and he went forth out of their hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>and went away again to the other side of the Jordan, to the place where John was at first baptizing, and remained there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>and many came unto him, and said -- 'John, indeed, did no sign, and all things, as many as John said about this one were true;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>And there was a certain one ailing, Lazarus, from Bethany, of the village of Mary and Martha her sister --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>and it was Mary who did anoint the Lord with ointment, and did wipe his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was ailing --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>therefore sent the sisters unto him, saying, 'Sir, lo, he whom you do love is ailing;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>and Jesus having heard, said, 'This ailment is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified through it.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>And Jesus was loving Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>when, therefore, he heard that he is ailing, then indeed he remained in the place in which he was two days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>then after this, he said to the disciples, 'We may go to Judea again;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>the disciples say to him, 'Rabbi, now were the Jews seeking to stone you, and again you do go thither!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, 'Are there not twelve hours in the day? if any one may walk in the day, he does not stumble, because the light of this world he does see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>and if any one may walk in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things he said, and after this he said to them, 'Lazarus our friend has fallen asleep, but I go on that I may awake him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>therefore said his disciples, 'Sir, if he has fallen asleep, he will be saved;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>but Jesus had spoken about his death, but they thought that about the repose of sleep he speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then, therefore, Jesus said to them freely, 'Lazarus has died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>and I rejoice, for your sake, (that you may believe,) that I was not there; but we may go to him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>therefore said Thomas, who is called Didymus, to the fellow-disciples, 'We may go -- we also, that we may die with him,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Jesus, therefore, having come, found him having been four days already in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>And Bethany was near to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come unto Martha and Mary, that they might comfort them concerning their brother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha, therefore, when she heard that Jesus does come, met him, and Mary kept sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha, therefore, said unto Jesus, 'Sir, if you hadst been here, my brother had not died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>but even now, I have known that whatever you may ask of God, God will give to you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, 'Your brother shall rise again.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to him, 'I have known that he will rise again, in the rising again in the last day;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, 'I am the rising again, and the life; he who is believing in me, even if he may die, shall live;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>believe you this?' she said to him, 'Yes, sir, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is coming to the world.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And these things having said, she went away, and called Mary her sister privately, saying, 'The Teacher is present, and does call you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>she, when she heard, rises up quickly, and does come to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>and Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was in the place where Martha met him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>the Jews, therefore, who were with her in the house, and were comforting her, having seen Mary that she rose up quickly and went forth, followed her, saying -- 'She does go away to the tomb, that she may weep there.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary, therefore, when she came where Jesus was, having seen him, fell at his feet, saying to him, 'Sir, if you hadst been here, my brother had not died;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Jesus, therefore, when he saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her weeping, did groan in the spirit, and troubled himself, and he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>'Where have you laid him?' they say to him, 'Sir, come and see;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews, therefore, said, 'Lo, how he was loving him!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>and certain of them said, 'Was not this one, who did open the eyes of the blind man, able to cause that also this one might not have died?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus, therefore, again groaning in himself, comes to the tomb, and it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, 'Take you away the stone;' the sister of him who has died -- Martha -- said to him, 'Sir, already he stinks, for he is four days dead;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, 'Said I not to you, that if you may believe, you shall see the glory of God?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>They took away, therefore, the stone where the dead was laid, and Jesus lifted his eyes upwards, and said, 'Father, I thank You, that You did hear me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>and I knew that You always do hear me, but, because of the multitude that is standing by, I saidit, that they may believe that You did send me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And these things saying, with a loud voice he cried out, 'Lazarus, come forth;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>and he who died came forth, being bound feet and hands with grave-clothes, and his visage with a napkin was bound about; Jesus said to them, 'Loose him, and suffer to go.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many, therefore, of the Jews who came unto Mary, and beheld what Jesus did, believed in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>but certain of them went away unto the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus did;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>the chief priests, therefore, and the Pharisees, gathered together a sanhedrin, and said, 'What may we do? because this man does many signs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>if we may let him alone thus, all will believe in him; and the Romans will come, and will take away both our place and nation.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>and a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being chief priest of that year, said to them, 'You have not known anything,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor reason that it is good for us that one man may die for the people, and not the whole nation perish.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>And this he said not of himself, but being chief priest of that year, he did prophesy that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but that also the children of God, who have been scattered abroad, he may gather together into one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>From that day, therefore, they took counsel together that they may kill him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus, therefore, was no more freely walking among the Jews, but went away thence to the region near the wilderness, to a city called Ephraim, and there he tarried with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, that they might purify themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>they were seeking, therefore, Jesus, and said one with another, standing in the temple, 'What does appear to you -- that he may not come to the feast?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>and both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if any one may know where he is, he may show it, so that they may seize him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus, therefore, six days before the passover, came to Bethany, where was Lazarus, who had died, whom he raised out of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>they made, therefore, to him a supper there, and Martha was ministering, and Lazarus was one of those reclining together (at meat) with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary, therefore, having taken a pound of ointment of spikenard, of great price, anointed the feet of Jesus and did wipe with her hair his feet, and the house was filled from the fragrance of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Therefore said one of his disciples -- Judas Iscariot, of Simon, who is about to deliver him up --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>'Therefore was not this ointment sold for three hundred denaries, and given to the poor?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>and he said this, not because he was caring for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and what things were put in he was carrying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus, therefore, said, 'Suffer her; for the day of my embalming she has kept it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>for the poor you have always with yourselves, and me you have not always.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>A great multitude, therefore, of the Jews knew that he is there, and they came, not because of Jesus only, but that Lazarus also they may see, whom he raised out of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>and the chief priests took counsel, that also Lazarus they may kill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away, and were believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the morrow, a great multitude that came to the feast, having heard that Jesus does come to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of the palms, and went forth to meet him, and were crying, 'Hosanna, blessed is he who is coming in the name of the Lord -- the king of Israel;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>and Jesus having found a young ass did sit upon it, according as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>'Fear not, daughter of Sion, lo, your king does come, sitting on an ass' colt.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>And these things his disciples did not know at the first, but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were having been written about him, and these things they did to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The multitude, therefore, who are with him, were testifying that he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and did raise him out of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>because of this also did the multitude meet him, because they heard of his having done this sign,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>the Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, 'You see that you do not gain anything, lo, the world did go after him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were certain Greeks out of those coming up that they may worship in the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>these then came near to Philip, who is from Bethsaida of Galilee, and were asking him, saying, 'Sir, we wish to see Jesus;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip comes and tells Andrew, and again Andrew and Philip tell Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus responded to them, saying, 'The hour has come that the Son of Man may be glorified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>verily, verily, I say to you, if the grain of the wheat, having fallen to the earth, may not die, itself remains alone; and if it may die, it does bear much fruit;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>And this he said signifying by what death he was about to die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>the multitude answered him, 'We heard out of the law that the Christ does remain -- to the age; and how do you say, That it behooves the Son of Man to be lifted up? who is this -- the Son of Man?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus, therefore, said to them, 'Yet a little time is the light with you; walk while you have the light, that darkness may not overtake you; and he who is walking in the darkness has not known where he goes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>while you have the light, believe in the light, that sons of light you may become.' These things spake Jesus, and having gone away, he was hid from them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>yet he having done so many signs before them, they were not believing in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said, 'Lord, who gave credence to our report? and the arm of the Lord -- to whom was it revealed?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Because of this they were not able to believe, that again Isaiah said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>'He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart, that they might not see with the eyes, and understand with the heart, and turn back, and I might heal them;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>these things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spake of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Still, however, also out of the rulers did many believe in him, but because of the Pharisees they were not confessing, that they might not be put out of the synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>And Jesus cried and said, 'He who is believing in me, does not believe in me, but in Him who sent me;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>for certain were thinking, since Judas had the bag, that Jesus said to him, 'Buy what we have need of for the feast;' or that he may give something to the poor;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>These things having said, Jesus went forth with his disciples beyond the brook of Kedron, where was a garden, into which he entered, himself and his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>and Judas also, who delivered him up, had known the place, because many times did Jesus assemble there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>Judas, therefore, having taken the band and officers out of the chief priests and Pharisees, does come thither with torches and lamps, and weapons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>Jesus, therefore, knowing all things that are coming upon him, having gone forth, said to them, 'Whom do you seek?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>they answered him, 'Jesus the Nazarene;' Jesus said to them, 'I amhe;' -- and Judas who delivered him up was standing with them; --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>when, therefore, he said to them -- 'I amhe,' they went away backward, and fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>Again, therefore, he questioned them, 'Whom do you seek?' and they said, 'Jesus the Nazarene;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus answered, 'I said to you that I amhe; if, then, me you seek, suffer these to go away;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>that the word might be fulfilled that he said -- 'Those whom You have given to me, I did not lose of them even one.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Simon Peter, therefore, having a sword, drew it, and struck the chief priest's servant, and cut off his right ear -- and the name of the servant was Malchus --</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Jesus, therefore, said to Peter, 'Put the sword into the sheath; the cup that the Father has given to me, may I not drink it?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>The band, therefore, and the captain, and the officers of the Jews, took hold on Jesus, and bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>and they led him away to Annas first, for he was father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was chief priest of that year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>and Caiaphas was he who gave counsel to the Jews, that it is good for one man to perish for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>And following Jesus was Simon Peter, and the other disciple, and that disciple was known to the chief priest, and he entered with Jesus to the hall of the chief priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>and Peter was standing at the door without, therefore went forth the other disciple who was known to the chief priest, and he spake to the female keeping the door, and he brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>Then said the maid keeping the door to Peter, 'Art you also of the disciples of this man?' he said, 'I am not;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>and the servants and the officers were standing, having made a fire of coals, because it was cold, and they were warming themselves, and Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>The chief priests, therefore, questioned Jesus concerning his disciples, and concerning his teaching;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered him, 'I spake freely to the world, I did always teach in a synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews do always come together; and in secret I spake nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>why me do you question? question those having heard what I spake to them; lo, these have known what I said.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>And he having said these things, one of the officers standing by did give Jesus a slap, saying, 'Thus do you answer the chief priest?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus answered him, 'If I spake ill, testify concerning the ill; and if well, why me do you smite?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the chief priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>And Simon Peter was standing and warming himself, they said then to him, 'Are you also of his disciples?' he denied, and said, 'I am not.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the servants of the chief priest, being kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, said, 'Did not I see you in the garden with him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>again, therefore, Peter denied, and immediately a cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>They led, therefore, Jesus from Caiaphas to the praetorium, and it was early, and they themselves did not enter into the praetorium, that they might not be defiled, but that they might eat the passover;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate, therefore, went forth unto them, and said, 'What accusation do you bring against this man?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>they answered and said to him, 'If he were not an evil doer, we had not delivered him to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate, therefore, said to them, 'Take you him -- you -- and according to your law judge him;' the Jews, therefore, said to him, 'It is not lawful to us to put any one to death;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>that the word of Jesus might be fulfilled which he said, signifying by what death he was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Pilate, therefore, entered into the praetorium again, and called Jesus, and said to him, 'You are the King of the Jews?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered him, 'From yourself do you say this? or did others say it to you about me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, 'Am I a Jew? your nation, and the chief priests did deliver you up to me; what did you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, 'My kingdom is not of this world; if my kingdom were of this world, my officers had struggled that I might not be delivered up to Jews; but now my kingdom is not from hence.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate, therefore, said to him, 'Art you then a king?' Jesus answered, 'You do sayit; because a king I am, I for this have been born, and for this I have come to the world, that I may testify to the truth; every one who is of the truth, does hear my voice.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, 'What is truth?' and this having said, again he went forth unto the Jews, and said to them, 'I do find no fault in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>and you have a custom that I shall release to you one in the passover; will you, therefore, that I shall release to you the king of the Jews?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>therefore they all cried out again, saying, 'Not this one -- but Barabbas;' and Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then, therefore, did Pilate take Jesus and scourge him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>and the soldiers having plaited a crown of thorns, did place it on his head, and a purple garment they put around him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and said, 'Hail! the king of the Jews;' and they were giving him slaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate, therefore, again went forth without, and said to them, 'Lo, I do bring him to you without, that you may know that in him I find no fault;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Jesus, therefore, came forth without, bearing the thorny crown and the purple garment; and he said to them, 'Lo, the man!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When, therefore, the chief priests and the officers did see him, they cried out, saying, 'Crucify, crucify;' Pilate said to them, 'Take you him -- you, and crucify; for I find no fault in him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>the Jews answered him, 'We have a law, and according to our law he ought to die, for he made himself Son of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When, therefore, Pilate heard this word, he was the more afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and entered again to the praetorium, and said to Jesus, 'Whence are you?' and Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate, therefore, said to him, 'To me do you not speak? Have you not known that I have authority to crucify you, and I have authority to release you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, 'You wouldst have no authority against me, if it were not having been given you from above; because of this, he who is delivering me up to you has greater sin.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this time was Pilate seeking to release him, and the Jews were crying out, saying, 'If this one you may release, you are not a friend of Caesar; every one making himself a king, does speak against Caesar.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate, therefore, having heard this word, brought Jesus without -- and he sat down upon the tribunal -- to a place called, 'Pavement,' and in Hebrew, Gabbatha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>and it was the preparation of the passover, and as it were the sixth hour, and he said to the Jews, 'Lo, your king!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>and they cried out, 'Take away, take away, crucify him;' Pilate said to them, 'Your king shall I crucify?' the chief priests answered, 'We have no king except Caesar.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then, therefore, he delivered him up to them, that he may be crucified, and they took Jesus and led him away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>and bearing his cross, he went forth to the place called Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew Golgotha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on this side, and on that side, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross, and it was written, 'Jesus the Nazarene, the king of the Jews;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>this title, therefore, read many of the Jews, because the place was near to the city where Jesus was crucified, and it was having been written in Hebrew, in Greek, in Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The chief priests of the Jews said, therefore, to Pilate, 'Write not -- The king of the Jews, but that one said, I am king of the Jews;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, 'What I have written, I have written.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers, therefore, when they did crucify Jesus, took his garments, and made four parts, to each soldier a part, also the coat, and the coat was seamless, from the top woven throughout,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>they said, therefore, to one another, 'We may not rend it, but cast a lot for it, whose it shall be;' that the Writing might be fulfilled, that is saying, 'They divided my garments to themselves, and upon my raiment they did cast a lot;' the soldiers, therefore, indeed, did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>And there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jesus, therefore, having seen his mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he was loving, he said to his mother, 'Woman, lo, your son;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>afterward he said to the disciple, 'Lo, your mother;' and from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus knowing that all things now have been finished, that the Writing may be fulfilled, said, 'I thirst;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>a vessel, therefore, was placed full of vinegar, and they having filled a sponge with vinegar, and having put it around a hyssop stalk, did put it to his mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>when, therefore, Jesus received the vinegar, he said, 'It has been finished;' and having bowed the head, gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews, therefore, that the bodies might not remain on the cross on the sabbath, since it was the preparation, (for that sabbath day was a great one,) asked of Pilate that their legs may be broken, and they taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers, therefore, came, and of the first indeed they did break the legs, and of the other who was crucified with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>and having come to Jesus, when they saw him already having been dead, they did not break his legs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>but one of the soldiers with a spear did pierce his side, and immediately there came forth blood and water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>and he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true, and that one has known that true things he speaks, that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things came to pass, that the Writing may be fulfilled, 'A bone of him shall not be broken;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>and again another Writing said, 'They shall look to him whom they did pierce.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things did Joseph of Arimathea -- being a disciple of Jesus, but concealed, through the fear of the Jews -- ask of Pilate, that he may take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave leave; he came, therefore, and took away the body of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>and Nicodemus also came -- who came unto Jesus by night at the first -- bearing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, as it were, a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>They took, therefore, the body of Jesus, and bound it with linen clothes with the spices, according as it was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>and there was in the place where he was crucified a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, in which no one was yet laid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>there, therefore, because of the preparation of the Jews, because the tomb was near, they laid Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>And on the first of the sabbaths, Mary the Magdalene does come early (there being yet darkness) to the tomb, and she sees the stone having been taken away out of the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>she runs, therefore, and comes unto Simon Peter, and unto the other disciple whom Jesus was loving, and said to them, 'They took away the Lord out of the tomb, and we have not known where they laid him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter, therefore, went forth, and the other disciple, and they were coming to the tomb,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Simon Peter, therefore, comes, following him, and he entered into the tomb, and beholds the linen clothes lying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>then, therefore, entered also the other disciple who came first unto the tomb, and he saw, and did believe;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things did Jesus manifest himself again to the disciples on the sea of Tiberias, and he did manifest himself thus:</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple, therefore, whom Jesus was loving said to Peter, 'The Lord it is!' Simon Peter, therefore, having heard that it is the Lord, did gird on the outer coat, (for he was naked,) and did cast himself into the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>and the other disciples came by the little boat, for they were not far from the land, but as it were about two hundred cubits off, dragging the net of the fishes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>when, therefore, they came to the land, they behold a fire of coals lying, and a fish lying on it, and bread.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>and this he said, signifying by what death he shall glorify God; and having said this, he said to him, 'Be following me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>And Peter having turned about does see the disciple whom Jesus was loving following, (who also reclined in the supper on his breast, and said, 'Sir, who is he who is delivering you up?')</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter having seen this one, said to Jesus, 'Lord, and what of this one?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, 'If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to you? be you following me.' This word, therefore, went forth to the brethren that that disciple does not die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>yet Jesus did not say to him, that he does not die, but, 'If him I will to remain till I come, what -- to you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>this is the disciple who is testifying concerning these things, and he wrote these things, and we have known that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things -- as many as Jesus did -- which, if they may be written one by one, not even the world itself I think to have place for the books written. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The former account, indeed, I made concerning all things, O Theophilus, that Jesus began both to do and to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>till the day in which, having given command, through the Holy Spirit, to the apostles whom he did choose out, he was taken up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>to whom also he did present himself alive after his suffering, in many certain proofs, through forty days being seen by them, and speaking the things concerning the reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And being assembled together with them, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he,'You did hear of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>because John, indeed, baptized with water, and you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit -- after not many days.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>They, therefore, indeed, having come together, were questioning him, saying, 'Lord, do you at this time restore the reign to Israel?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>and he said unto them, 'It is not yours to know times or seasons that the Father did appoint in His own authority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>but you shall receive power at the coming of the Holy Spirit upon you, and you shall be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and Samaria, and unto the end of the earth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And these things having said -- they beholding -- he was taken up, and a cloud did receive him up from their sight;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>and as they were looking stedfastly to the heaven in his going on, then, lo, two men stood by them in white apparel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who also said, 'Men, Galileans, why do you stand gazing into the heaven? this Jesus who was received up from you into the heaven, shall so come in what manner you saw him going on to the heaven.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then did they return to Jerusalem from the mount that is called of Olives, that is near Jerusalem, a sabbath's journey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>and when they came in, they went up to the upper room, where were abiding both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James, of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zelotes, and Judas, of James;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>these all were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in these days, Peter having risen up in the midst of the disciples, said, (the multitude also of the names at the same place was, as it were, an hundred and twenty,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>'Men, brethren, it behoved this Writing that it be fulfilled that beforehand the Holy Spirit spake through the mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who took Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>because he was numbered among us, and did receive the share in this ministration,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>this one, indeed, then, purchased a field out of the reward of unrighteousness, and falling headlong, burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>and it became known to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, insomuch that that place is called, in their proper dialect, Aceldama, that is, field of blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>for it has been written in the book of Psalms: Let his lodging-place become desolate, and let no one be dwelling in it, and his oversight let another take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>'It behooves, therefore, of the men who did go with us during all the time in which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning from the baptism of John, unto the day in which he was received up from us, one of these to become with us a witness of his rising again.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they set two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>and having prayed, they said, 'You, Lord, who are knowing the heart of all, show which one you did choose of these two</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to receive the share of this ministration and apostleship, from which Judas, by transgression, did fall, to go on to his proper place;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>and they gave their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And in the day of the Pentecost being fulfilled, they were all with one accord at the same place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>and there came suddenly out of the heaven a sound as of a bearing violent breath, and it filled all the house where they were sitting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>and there appeared to them divided tongues, as it were of fire; it sat also upon each one of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, according as the Spirit was giving them to declare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>And there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation of those under the heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>and the rumour of this having come, the multitude came together, and was confounded, because they were each one hearing them speaking in his proper dialect,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>and they were all amazed, and did wonder, saying one unto another, 'Lo, are not all these who are speaking Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>and how do we hear, each in our proper dialect, in which we were born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, in Judea also, and Cappadocia, Pontus, and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia also, and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya, that are along Cyrene, and the strangers of Rome, both Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretes and Arabians, we did hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>And they were all amazed, and were in doubt, saying one unto another, 'What would this wish to be?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>and others mocking said, -- 'They are full of sweet wine;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>and Peter having stood up with the eleven, lifted up his voice and declared to them, 'Men, Jews! and all those dwelling in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and hearken to my sayings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>for these are not drunken, as you take it up, for it is the third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>'But this is that which has been spoken through the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it shall be in the last days, said God, I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>and also upon My men-servants, and upon My maid-servants, in those days, I will pour out of My Spirit, and they shall prophesy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>and I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs upon the earth beneath -- blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>the sun shall be turned to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the day of the Lord -- the great and illustrious;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>and it shall be, every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>'Men, Israelites! hear these words, Jesus the Nazarene, a man approved of God among you by mighty works, and wonders, and signs, that God did through him in the midst of you, according as also you yourselves have known;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>this one, by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, being given out, having taken by lawless hands, having crucified -- you did slay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>whom God did raise up, having loosed the pains of the death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>for David said in regard to him: I foresaw the Lord always before me -- because He is on my right hand -- that I may not be moved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>because of this was my heart cheered, and my tongue was glad, and yet -- my flesh also shall rest on hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>because You will not leave my soul to hades, nor will You give Your Kind One to see corruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You did make known to me ways of life, You shall fill me with joy with Your countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>'Men, brethren! it is permitted to speak with freedom unto you concerning the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is among us unto this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>a prophet, therefore, being, and knowing that with an oath God did swear to him, out of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, to raise up the Christ, to sit upon his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>having foreseen, he did speak concerning the rising again of the Christ, that his soul was not left to hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>'This Jesus did God raise up, of which we are all witnesses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>at the right hand then of God having been exalted -- also the promise of the Holy Spirit having received from the Father -- he was shedding forth this, which now you see and hear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>for David did not go up to the heavens, and he said himself: The Lord said to my lord, Sit you at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>till I make your foes your footstool;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>assuredly, therefore, let all the house of Israel know, that both Lord and Christ did God make him -- this Jesus whom you did crucify.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>And having heard, they were pricked to the heart; they say also to Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, 'What shall we do, men, brethren?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>and Peter said unto them, 'Reform, and be baptized each of you on the name of Jesus Christ, to remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>for to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>Also with many more other words he was testifying and exhorting, saying, 'Be saved from this perverse generation;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>then those, indeed, who did gladly receive his word were baptized, and there were added on that day, as it were, three thousand souls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>and they were continuing stedfastly in the teaching of the apostles, and the fellowship, and the breaking of the bread, and the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And fear came on every soul, many wonders also and signs were being done through the apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>and all those believing were at the same place, and had all things common,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>and the possessions and the goods they were selling, and were parting them to all, according as any one had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>Daily also continuing with one accord in the temple, breaking also at every house bread, they were partaking of food in gladness and simplicity of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God, and having favour with all the people, and the Lord was adding those being saved every day to the assembly.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>And Peter and John were going up at the same time to the temple, at the hour of the prayer, the ninth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>and a certain man, being lame from the womb of his mother, was being carried, whom they were laying every day at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask a kindness from those entering into the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>who, having seen Peter and John about to go into the temple, was begging to receive a kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And Peter, having looked stedfastly toward him with John, said, 'Look toward us;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>and he was giving heed to them, looking to receive something from them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>and Peter said, 'Silver and gold I have none, but what I have, that I give to you; in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and be walking.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And having seized him by the right hand, he raised him up, and presently his feet and ankles were strengthened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>and springing up, he stood, and was walking, and did enter with them into the temple, walking and springing, and praising God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>and all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>they were knowing him also that this it was who for a kindness was sitting at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what has happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And at the lame man who was healed holding Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch called Solomon's -- greatly amazed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>and Peter having seen, answered unto the people, 'Men, Israelites! why wonder you at this? or on us why look you so earnestly, as if by our own power or piety we have made him to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>'The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, did glorify His child Jesus, whom you delivered up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, he having given judgment to release him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>and you the Holy and Righteous One did deny, and desired a man -- a murderer -- to be granted to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>and the Prince of the life you did kill, whom God did raise out of the dead, of which we are witnesses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>and on the faith of his name, this one whom you see and have known, his name made strong, even the faith that is through him did give to him this perfect soundness before you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>'And now, brethren, I have known that through ignorance you did it, as also your rulers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>and God, what things before He had declared through the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ should suffer, He did thus fulfil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>reform you, therefore, and turn back, for your sins being blotted out, that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and He may send Jesus Christ who before has been preached to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom it behooves heaven, indeed, to receive till times of a restitution of all things, of which God spake through the mouth of all His holy prophets from the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>'For Moses, indeed, unto the fathers said -- A prophet to you shall the Lord your God raise up out of your brethren, like to me; him shall you hear in all things, as many as he may speak unto you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>and it shall be, every soul that may not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed out of the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>and also all the prophets from Samuel and those following in order, as many as spake, did also foretell of these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>'You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made unto our fathers, saying unto Abraham: And in your seed shall be blessed all the families of the earth;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>And as they are speaking unto the people, there came to them the priests, and the magistrate of the temple, and the Sadducees --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being grieved because of their teaching the people, and preaching in Jesus the rising again out of the dead --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>and they laid hands upon them, and did put them in custody unto the morrow, for it was evening already;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>and many of those hearing the word did believe, and the number of the men became, as it were, five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And it came to pass upon the morrow, there were gathered together of them the rulers, and elders, and scribes, to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and Annas the chief priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the chief priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>and having set them in the midst, they were inquiring, 'In what power, or in what name did you do this?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them: 'Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if we to-day are examined concerning the good deed to the ailing man, by whom he has been saved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known to all of you, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you did crucify, whom God did raise out of the dead, in him has this one stood by before you whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>'This is the stone that was set at nought by you -- the builders, that became head of a corner;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>and there is not salvation in any other, for there is no other name under the heaven that has been given among men, in which it behooves us to be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>And beholding the openness of Peter and John, and having perceived that they are men unlettered and plebeian, they were wondering -- they were taking knowledge also of them that with Jesus they had been --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>and seeing the man standing with them who has been healed, they had nothing to say against it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>and having commanded them to go away out of the sanhedrin, they took counsel with one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, 'What shall we do to these men? because that, indeed, a notable sign has been done through them, to all those dwelling in Jerusalem is manifest, and we are not able to deny it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>but that it may spread no further toward the people, let us strictly threaten them no more to speak in this name to any man.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And having called them, they charged them not to speak at all, nor to teach, in the name of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>and Peter and John answering unto them said, 'Whether it is righteous before God to hearken to you rather than to God, judge you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>for we cannot but speak what we did see and hear.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>And they having further threatened them, let them go, finding nothing how they may punish them, because of the people, because all were glorifying God for that which has been done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>for above forty years of age was the man upon whom had been done this sign of the healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And being let go, they went unto their own friends, and declared whatever the chief priests and the elders said unto them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>and they having heard, with one accord did lift up the voice unto God, and said, 'Lord, you art God, who did make the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all that are in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>who, through the mouth of David your servant, did say, Why did nations rage, and peoples meditate vain things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>the kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord and against His Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>for gathered together of a truth against Your holy child Jesus, whom You did anoint, were both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with nations and peoples of Israel,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>'And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and grant to Your servants with all freedom to speak Your word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>in the stretching forth of Your hand, for healing, and signs, and wonders, to come to pass through the name of Your holy child Jesus.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And they having prayed, the place was shaken in which they were gathered together, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and were speaking the word of God with freedom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>and of the multitude of those who did believe the heart and the soul was one, and not one was saying that anything of the things he had was his own, but all things were to them in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And with great power were the apostles giving the testimony to the rising again of the Lord Jesus, great grace also was on them all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>for there was not any one among them who did lack, for as many as were possessors of fields, or houses, selling them, were bringing the prices of the thing sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and were laying them at the feet of the apostles, and distribution was being made to each according as any one had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>And Joses, who was surnamed by the apostles Barnabas -- which is, having been interpreted, Son of Comfort -- a Levite, of Cyprus by birth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>a field being his, having sold it, brought the money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>And a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>and did keep back of the price -- his wife also knowing -- and having brought a certain part, at the feet of the apostles he laid it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>And Peter said, 'Ananias, therefore did the Adversary fill your heart, for you to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back of the price of the place?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>while it remained, did it not remain yours? and having been sold, in your authority was it not? why is it that you did put in your heart this thing? you did not lie to men, but to God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>and Ananias hearing these words, having fallen down, did expire, and great fear came upon all who heard these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>and having risen, the younger men wound him up, and having carried forth, they buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>And it came to pass, about three hours after, that his wife, not knowing what has happened, came in,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>And Peter said unto her, 'How was it agreed by you, to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? lo, the feet of those who did bury your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you forth;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>and she fell down presently at his feet, and expired, and the young men having come in, found her dead, and having carried forth, they buried her by her husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>and great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>And through the hands of the apostles came many signs and wonders among the people, and they were with one accord all in the porch of Solomon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>and of the rest no one was daring to join himself to them, but the people were magnifying them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>(and the more were believers added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>so as into the broad places to bring forth the ailing, and to lay them upon couches and mats, that at the coming of Peter, even his shadow might overshadow some one of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>and there were coming together also the people of the cities round about to Jerusalem, bearing ailing persons, and those harassed by unclean spirits -- who were all healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>And having risen, the chief priest, and all those with him -- being the sect of the Sadducees -- were filled with zeal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>and laid their hands upon the apostles, and did put them in a public prison;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>and a messenger of the Lord through the night opened the doors of the prison, having also brought them forth, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>'Go on, and standing, speak in the temple to the people all the sayings of this life;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>and having heard, they did enter at the dawn into the temple, and were teaching. And the chief priest having come, and those with him, they called together the sanhedrin and all the senate of the sons of Israel, and they sent to the prison to have them brought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>and the officers having come, did not find them in the prison, and having turned back, they told,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying -- 'The prison indeed we found shut in all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors, and having opened -- within we found no one.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>And as the priest, and the magistrate of the temple, and the chief priests, heard these words, they were doubting concerning them to what this would come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>and coming near, a certain one told them, saying -- 'Lo, the men whom you did put in the prison are in the temple standing and teaching the people;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>then the magistrate having gone away with officers, brought them without violence, for they were fearing the people, lest they should be stoned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>and having brought them, they set them in the sanhedrin, and the chief priest questioned them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>saying, 'Did not we strictly command you not to teach in this name? and lo, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring upon us the blood of this man.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>And Peter and the apostles answering, said, 'To obey God it behooves, rather than men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>and the God of our fathers did raise up Jesus, whom you slew, having hanged upon a tree;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>this one God, a Prince and a Saviour, has exalted with His right hand, to give reformation to Israel, and forgiveness of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>and we are His witnesses of these sayings, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God gave to those obeying him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>And they having heard, were cut to the heart, and were taking counsel to slay them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>but a certain one, having risen up in the sanhedrin -- a Pharisee, by name Gamaliel, a teacher of law honoured by all the people -- commanded to put the apostles forth a little,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>and said unto them, 'Men, Israelites, take heed to yourselves about these men, what you are about to do,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>for before these days rose up Theudas, saying, that himself was some one, to whom a number of men did join themselves, as it were four hundred, who was slain, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered, and came to nought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>'After this one rose up, Judas the Galilean, in the days of the enrollment, and drew away much people after him, and that one perished, and all, as many as were obeying him, were scattered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>and now I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone, because if this counsel or this work may be of men, it will be overthrown,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>and if it be of God, you are not able to overthrow it, lest perhaps also you be found fighting against God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>And to him they agreed, and having called near the apostles, having beaten them, they commanded them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>they, indeed, then, departed from the presence of the sanhedrin, rejoicing that for his name they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>every day also in the temple, and in every house, they were not ceasing teaching and proclaiming good news -- Jesus the Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>And in these days, the disciples multiplying, there came a murmuring of the Hellenists at the Hebrews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily ministration,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>And the word of God did increase, and the number of the disciples did multiply in Jerusalem exceedingly; a great multitude also of the priests were obedient to the faith.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>and there arose certain of those of the synagogue, called of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia, and Asia, disputing with Stephen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>and they were not able to resist the wisdom and the spirit with which he was speaking;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>then they suborned men, saying -- 'We have heard him speaking evil sayings in regard to Moses and God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>They did stir up also the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and having come upon him, they caught him, and brought him to the sanhedrin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>they set up also false witnesses, saying, 'This one does not cease to speak evil sayings against this holy place and the law,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>and Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through, he was proclaiming good news to all the cities, till his coming to Caesarea.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.9'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>And Saul, yet breathing of threatening and slaughter to the disciples of the Lord, having gone to the chief priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>did ask from him letters to Damascus, unto the synagogues, that if he may find any being of the way, both men and women, he may bring them bound to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>And in the going, he came near to Damascus, and suddenly there shone round about him a light from the heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>and having fallen upon the earth, he heard a voice saying to him, 'Saul, Saul, why me do you persecute?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>And he said, 'Who are you, Lord?' and the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you do persecute; hard for you at the pricks to kick;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>trembling also, and astonished, he said, 'Lord, what do you wish me to do?' and the Lord said unto him, 'Arise, and enter into the city, and it shall be told you what it behooves you to do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>And the men who are journeying with him stood speechless, hearing indeed the voice but seeing no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>and Saul arose from the earth, and his eyes having been opened, he beheld no one, and leading him by the hand they brought him to Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>and he was three days without seeing, and he did neither eat nor drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>And there was a certain disciple in Damascus, by name Ananias, and the Lord said unto him in a vision, 'Ananias;' and he said, 'Behold me, Lord;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>and the Lord said unto him, 'Having risen, go on unto the street that is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas,one by name Saul of Tarsus, for, lo, he does pray,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>and he saw in a vision a man, by name Ananias, coming in, and putting a hand on him, that he may see again.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>And Ananias answered, 'Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many evils he did to Your saints in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>and here he has authority from the chief priests, to bind all those calling on Your name.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>And the Lord said unto him, 'Be going on, because a choice vessel to Me is this one, to bear My name before nations and kings -- the sons also of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>for I will show him how many things it behooves him for My name to suffer.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>And Ananias went away, and did enter into the house, and having put upon him his hands, said, 'Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me -- Jesus who did appear to you in the way in which you were coming -- that you may see again, and may be filled with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales, he saw again also presently, and having risen, was baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>and having received nourishment, was strengthened, and Saul was with the disciples in Damascus certain days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>and immediately in the synagogues he was preaching the Christ, that he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>And all those hearing were amazed, and said, 'Is not this he who laid waist in Jerusalem those calling on this name, and hither to this intent had come, that he might bring them bound to the chief priests?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>And Saul was still more strengthened, and he was confounding the Jews dwelling in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel together to kill him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>and their counsel against him was known to Saul; they were also watching the gates both day and night, that they may kill him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>and the disciples having taken him, by night did let him down by the wall, letting down in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>And Saul, having come to Jerusalem, did try to join himself to the disciples, and they were all afraid of him, not believing that he is a disciple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>and Barnabas having taken him, brought him unto the apostles, and did declare to them how in the way he saw the Lord, and that he spake to him, and how in Damascus he was speaking boldly in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>And he was with them, coming in and going out in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, he was both speaking and disputing with the Hellenists, and they were taking in hand to kill him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>and the brethren having known, brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>Then, indeed, the assemblies throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace, being built up, and, going on in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>And it came to pass that Peter passing throughout all quarters, came down also unto the saints who were dwelling at Lydda,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>and he found there a certain man, Aeneas by name -- for eight years laid upon a couch -- who was paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>and Peter said to him, 'Aeneas, heal you does Jesus the Christ; arise and spread for yourself;' and immediately he rose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>and all those dwelling at Lydda, and Saron saw him, and did turn to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>And in Joppa there was a certain female disciple, by name Tabitha, (which interpreted, is called Dorcas,) this woman was full of good works and kind acts that she was doing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>and it came to pass in those days she, having ailed, died, and having bathed her, they laid her in an upper chamber,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>and Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples having heard that Peter is in that place, sent two men unto him, calling on him not to delay to come through unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>And Peter having risen, went with them, whom having come, they brought into the upper chamber, and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing coats and garments, as many as Dorcas was making while she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>And Peter having put them all forth without, having bowed the knees, did pray, and having turned unto the body said, 'Tabitha, arise;' and she opened her eyes, and having seen Peter, she sat up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>and having given her his hand, he lifted her up, and having called the saints and the widows, he presented her alive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>and it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed on the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>and it came to pass, that he remained many days in Joppa, with a certain one, Simon a tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>And there was a certain man in Caesarea, by name Cornelius, a centurion from a band called Italian,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>pious, and fearing God with all his house, doing also many kind acts to the people, and beseeching God always,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>he saw in a vision manifestly, as it were the ninth hour of the day, a messenger of God coming in unto him, and saying to him, 'Cornelius;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>and he having looked earnestly on him, and becoming afraid, said, 'What is it, Lord?' And he said to him, 'Your prayers and your kind acts came up for a memorial before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>and now send men to Joppa, and send for a certain one Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>this one does lodge with a certain Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea; this one shall speak to you what it behooves you to do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the messenger who is speaking to Cornelius went away, having called two of his domestics, and a pious soldier of those waiting on him continually,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and having declared to them all things, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>And on the morrow, as these are proceeding on the way, and are drawing near to the city, Peter went up upon the house-top to pray, about the sixth hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>and he became very hungry, and wished to eat; and they making ready, there fell upon him a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>and he does behold the heaven opened, and descending unto him a certain vessel, as a great sheet, bound at the four corners, and let down upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which were all the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of the heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>and there came a voice unto him: 'Having risen, Peter, slay and eat.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>And Peter said, 'Not so, Lord; because at no time did I eat anything common or unclean;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>and there is a voice again a second time unto him: 'What God did cleanse, you, declare not you common;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>and this was done thrice, and again was the vessel received up to the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>And as Peter was perplexed in himself what the vision that he saw might be, then, lo, the men who have been sent from Cornelius, having made inquiry for the house of Simon, stood at the gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>and having called, they were asking if Simon, who is surnamed Peter, does lodge here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>And Peter thinking about the vision, the Spirit said to him, 'Lo, three men do seek you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>but having risen, go down and go on with them, nothing doubting, because I have sent them;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>and Peter having come down unto the men who have been sent from Cornelius unto him, said, 'Lo, I am he whom you seek, what is the cause for which you are present?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, 'Cornelius, a centurion, a man righteous and fearing God, well testified to, also, by all the nation of the Jews, was divinely warned by a holy messenger to send for you, to his house, and to hear sayings from you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Having called them in, therefore, he lodged them, and on the morrow Peter went forth with them, and certain of the brethren from Joppa went with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>and on the morrow they did enter into Caesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kindred and near friends,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>and as it came that Peter entered in, Cornelius having met him, having fallen at his feet, did bow before him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>and Peter raised him, saying, 'Stand up; I also myself am a man;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>and talking with him he went in, and does find many having come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said unto them, 'You know how it is unlawful for a man, a Jew, to keep company with, or to come unto, one of another race, but to me God did show to call no man common or unclean;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>therefore also without gainsaying I came, having been sent for; I ask, therefore, for what matter you did send for me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said, 'Four days ago till this hour, I was fasting, and at the ninth hour praying in my house, and, lo, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and he said, Cornelius, your prayer was heard, and your kind acts were remembered before God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>send, therefore, to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter; this one does lodge in the house of Simon a tanner, by the sea, who having come, shall speak to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>at once, therefore, I sent to you; you also did do well, having come; now, therefore, are we all before God present to hear all things that have been commanded you by God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>And Peter having opened his mouth, said, 'Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in every nation he who is fearing Him, and is working righteousness, is acceptable to Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>the word that he sent to the sons of Israel, proclaiming good news -- peace through Jesus Christ (this one is Lord of all,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>you -- you have known; -- the word that came throughout all Judea, having begun from Galilee, after the baptism that John preached;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>Jesus who is from Nazareth -- how God did anoint him with the Holy Spirit and power; who went through, doing good, and healing all those oppressed by the devil, because God was with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>and we -- we are witnesses of all things that he did, both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, -- whom they did slay, having hanged upon a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>'This one God did raise up the third day, and gave him to become manifest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to witnesses, to those having been chosen before by God -- to us who did eat with him, and did drink with him, after his rising out of the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>and he commanded us to preach to the people, and to testify fully that it is he who has been ordained by God judge of living and dead --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>to this one do all the prophets testify, that through his name every one that is believing in him does receive remission of sins.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter is yet speaking these sayings, the Holy spirit fell upon all those hearing the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>and those of the circumcision believing were astonished -- as many as came with Peter -- because also upon the nations the gift of the Holy Spirit has been poured out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>for they were hearing them speaking with tongues and magnifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Then answered Peter, 'The water is any one able to forbid, that these may not be baptized, who the Holy Spirit did receive -- even as also we?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>he commanded them also to be baptized in the name of the Lord; then they besought him to remain certain days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>And the apostles and the brethren who are in Judea heard that also the nations did receive the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>and when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision were contending with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying -- 'Unto men uncircumcised you did go in, and did eat with them!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>And Peter having begun, did expound to them in order saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>'I was in the city of Joppa praying, and I saw in a trance a vision, a certain vessel coming down, as a great sheet by four corners being let down out of the heaven, and it came unto me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>at which having looked stedfastly, I was considering, and I saw the four-footed beasts of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the fowls of heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>and I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, slay and eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>and I said, Not so, Lord; because anything common or unclean has at no time entered into my mouth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>and a voice did answer me a second time out of the heaven, What God did cleanse, you -- declare not you common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>'And this happened thrice, and again was all drawn up to the heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>and, lo, immediately, three men stood at the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea unto me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>and the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing doubting, and these six brethren also went with me, and we did enter into the house of the man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>he declared also to us how he saw the messenger in his house standing, and saying to him, Send men to Joppa, and call for Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>who shall speak sayings by which you shall be saved, you and all your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>'And in my beginning to speak, the Holy Spirit did fall upon them, even as also upon us in the beginning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>and I remembered the saying of the Lord, how he said, John indeed did baptize with water, and you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>if then the equal gift God did give to them as also to us, having believed upon the Lord Jesus Christ, I -- how was I able to withstand God?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>And they, having heard these things, were silent, and were glorifying God, saying, 'Then, indeed, also to the nations did God give the reformation to life.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Those, indeed, therefore, having been scattered abroad, from the tribulation that came after Stephen, went through unto Phenice, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none except to Jews only;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>and there were certain of them men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who having entered into Antioch, were speaking unto the Hellenists, proclaiming good news -- the Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>and the hand of the Lord was with them, a great number also, having believed, did turn unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And the account was heard in the ears of the assembly that is in Jerusalem concerning them, and they sent forth Barnabas to go through unto Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>who, having come, and having seen the grace of God, was glad, and was exhorting all with purpose of heart to cleave to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>because he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith, and a great multitude was added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus, to seek for Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>and having found him, he brought him to Antioch, and it came to pass that they a whole year did assemble together in the assembly, and taught a great multitude, the disciples also were divinely called first in Antioch Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>And in those days there came from Jerusalem prophets to Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>and one of them, by name Agabus, having stood up, did signify through the Spirit a great dearth is about to be throughout all the world -- which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>and the disciples, according as any one was prospering, determined each of them to send for ministration to the brethren dwelling in Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>which also they did, having sent unto the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>And about that time, Herod the king put forth his hands, to do evil to certain of those of the assembly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>and he killed James, the brother of John, with the sword,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>and having seen that it is pleasing to the Jews, he added to lay hold of Peter also -- and they were the days of the unleavened food --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>whom also having seized, he did put in prison, having delivered him to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending after the passover to bring him forth to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>Peter, therefore, indeed, was kept in the prison, and fervent prayer was being made by the assembly unto God for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>and when Herod was about to bring him forth, the same night was Peter sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with two chains, guards also before the door were keeping the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>and lo, a messenger of the Lord stood by, and a light shone in the buildings, and having smitten Peter on the side, he raised him up, saying, 'Rise in haste,' and his chains fell from off his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>The messenger also said to him, 'Gird yourself, and bind on your sandals;' and he did so; and he said to him, 'Put your garment round and be following me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>and having gone forth, he was following him, and he knew not that it is true that which is done through the messenger, and was thinking he saw a vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>and having passed through a first ward, and a second, they came unto the iron gate that is leading to the city, which of its own accord did open to them, and having gone forth, they went on through one street, and immediately the messenger departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And Peter having come to himself, said, 'Now I have known of a truth that the Lord did sent forth His messenger, and did deliver me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>also, having considered, he came unto the house of Mary, the mother of John, who is surnamed Mark, where there were many thronged together and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And Peter having knocked at the door of the porch, there came a damsel to hearken, by name Rhoda,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>and having known the voice of Peter, from the joy she did not open the porch, but having run in, told of the standing of Peter before the porch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>and they said unto her, 'You are mad;' and she was confidently affirming it to be so, and they said, 'It is his messenger;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>and Peter was continuing knocking, and having opened, they saw him, and were astonished,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>and having beckoned to them with the hand to be silent, he declared to them how the Lord brought him out of the prison, and he said, 'Declare to James and to the brethren these things;' and having gone forth, he went on to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>And day having come, there was not a little stir among the soldiers what then was become of Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>and Herod having sought for him, and not having found, having examined the guards, did command them to be led away to punishment, and having gone down from Judea to Caesarea, he was abiding there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>And Herod was highly displeased with the Tyrians and Sidonians, and with one accord they came unto him, and having made a friend of Blastus, who is over the bed-chambers of the king, they were asking peace, because of their country being nourished from the king's;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>and on a set day, Herod having arrayed himself in kingly apparel, and having sat down upon the tribunal, was making an oration unto them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>and the populace were shouting, 'The voice of a god, and not of a man;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>and presently there smote him a messenger of the Lord, because he did not give the glory to God, and having been eaten of worms, he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>And the word of God did grow and did multiply,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>and Barnabas and Saul did turn back out of Jerusalem, having fulfilled the ministration, having taken also with them John, who was surnamed Mark.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>And there were certain in Antioch, in the assembly there, prophets and teachers; both Barnabas, and Simeon who is called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, Manaen also -- Herod the tetrarch's foster-brother -- and Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>and in their ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, 'Separate you to me both Barnabas and Saul to the work to which I have called them,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>then having fasted, and having prayed, and having laid the hands on them, they sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>These, indeed, then, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, thence also they sailed to Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>and having come unto Salamis, they declared the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they had also John as a ministrant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>and having gone through the island unto Paphos, they found a certain magian, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name is Bar-Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; this one having called for Barnabas and Saul, did desire to hear the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>and there withstood them Elymas the magian -- for so is his name interpreted -- seeking to pervert the proconsul from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>And Saul -- who also is Paul -- having been filled with the Holy Spirit, and having looked stedfastly on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>said, 'O full of all guile, and all profligacy, son of a devil, enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the right ways of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>and now, lo, a hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season;' and presently there fell upon him a mist and darkness, and he, going about, was seeking some to lead him by the hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>then the proconsul having seen what has come to pass, did believe, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>And those about Paul having set sail from Paphos, came to Perga of Pamphylia, and John having departed from them, did turn back to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>and they having gone through from Perga, came to Antioch of Pisidia, and having gone into the synagogue on the sabbath-day, they sat down,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>and after the reading of the law and of the prophets, the chief men of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, 'Men, brethren, if there be a word in you of exhortation unto the people -- say on.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>And Paul having risen, and having beckoned with the hand, said, 'Men, Israelites, and those fearing God, hearken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>the God of this people Israel did choose our fathers, and the people He did exalt in their sojourning in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm did He bring them out of it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>and about a period of forty years He did suffer their manners in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>and having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, He did divide by lot to them their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>'And after these things, about four hundred and fifty years, He gave judges -- till Samuel the prophet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>and thereafter they asked for a king, and God did give to them Saul, son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>and having removed him, He did raise up to them David for king, to whom also having testified, he said, I found David, the son of Jesse, a man according to My heart, who shall do all My will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>'Of this one's seed God, according to promise, did raise to Israel a Saviour -- Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>John having first preached, before his coming, a baptism of reformation to all the people of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>and as John was fulfilling the course, he said, Whom me do you suppose to be? I am not he, but, lo, he does come after me, of whom I am not worthy to loose the sandal of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>'Men, brethren, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you fearing God, to you was the word of this salvation sent,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>and no cause of death having found, they did ask of Pilate that he should be slain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>and when they did complete all the things written about him, having taken him down from the tree, they laid him in a tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>and God did raise him out of the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>and he was seen for many days of those who did come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>'And we to you do proclaim good news -- that the promise made unto the fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>God has in full completed this to us their children, having raised up Jesus, as also in the second Psalm it has been written, My Son you are -- I to-day have begotten you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>'And that He did raise him up out of the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has said thus -- I will give to you the faithful kindnesses of David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>therefore also in another place he said, You shall not give Your kind One to see corruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>for David, indeed, his own generation having served by the will of God, did fall asleep, and was added unto his fathers, and saw corruption,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>but he whom God did raise up, did not see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>'Let it therefore be known to you, men, brethren, that through this one to you is the forgiveness of sins declared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>and from all things from which you were not able in the law of Moses to be declared righteous, in this one every one who is believing is declared righteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>see, therefore, it may not come upon you that has been spoken in the prophets:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>And having gone forth out of the synagogue of the Jews, the nations were calling upon them that on the next sabbath these sayings may be spoken to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>and the synagogue having been dismissed, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes did follow Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking to them, were persuading them to remain in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>And on the coming sabbath, almost all the city was gathered together to hear the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>and the Jews having seen the multitudes, were filled with zeal, and did contradict the things spoken by Paul -- contradicting and speaking evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>And speaking boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, 'To you it was necessary that first the word of God be spoken, and seeing you do thrust it away, and do not judge yourselves worthy of the life age-during, lo, we do turn to the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>for so has the Lord commanded us: I have set you for a light of nations -- for your being for salvation unto the end of the earth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>And the nations hearing were glad, and were glorifying the word of the Lord, and did believe -- as many as were appointed to life age-during;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>and the word of the Lord was spread abroad through all the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>And the Jews stirred up the devout and honourable women, and the first men of the city, and did raise persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and did put them out from their borders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>and they having shaken off the dust of their feet against them, came to Iconium,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>and the disciples were filled with joy and the Holy Spirit.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>And it came to pass in Iconium, that they did enter together into the synagogue of the Jews, and spake, so that there believed both of Jews and Greeks a great multitude;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>long time, indeed, therefore, did they abide speaking boldly in the Lord, who is testifying to the word of His grace, and granting signs and wonders to come to pass through their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were with the Jews, and some with the apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>and when there was a purpose both of the nations and of the Jews with their rulers to use them despitefully, and to stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>they having become aware, did flee to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and to the region round about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>and there they were proclaiming good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in the feet, was sitting, being lame from the womb of his mother -- who never had walked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>this one was hearing Paul speaking, who, having stedfastly beheld him, and having seen that he has faith to be saved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said with a loud voice, 'Stand up on your feet upright;' and he was springing and walking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>and the multitudes having seen what Paul did, did lift up their voice, in the speech of Lycaonia, saying, 'The gods, having become like men, did come down unto us;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>they were calling also Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, since he was the leader in speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>And the priest of the Zeus that is before their city, oxen and garlands unto the porches having brought, with the multitudes did wish to sacrifice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>and having heard, the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having rent their garments, did spring into the multitude, crying</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>and saying, 'Men, why these things do you? and we are men like-affected with you, proclaiming good news to you, from these vanities to turn unto the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in the past generations did suffer all the nations to go on in their ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>though, indeed, without witness He did not leave himself, doing good -- from heaven giving rains to us, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>and these things saying, scarcely did they restrain the multitudes from sacrificing to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>And there came thither, from Antioch and Iconium, Jews, and they having persuaded the multitudes, and having stoned Paul, drew him outside of the city, having supposed him to be dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>and the disciples having surrounded him, having risen he entered into the city, and on the morrow he went forth with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>Having proclaimed good news also to that city, and having discipled many, they turned back to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>confirming the souls of the disciples, exhorting to remain in the faith, and that through many tribulations it behooves us to enter into the reign of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>and having appointed to them by vote elders in every assembly, having prayed with fastings, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>And having passed through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>and having spoken in Perga the word, they went down to Attalia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>and thence did sail to Antioch, whence they had been given by the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>and having come and gathered together the assembly, they declared as many things as God did with them, and that He did open to the nations a door of faith;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>there having been, therefore, not a little dissension and disputation to Paul and Barnabas with them, they arranged for Paul and Barnabas, and certain others of them, to go up unto the apostles and elders to Jerusalem about this question,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>they indeed, then, having been sent forward by the assembly, were passing through Phenice and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the nations, and they were causing great joy to all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>And having come to Jerusalem, they were received by the assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, they declared also as many things as God did with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>and there rose up certain of those of the sect of the Pharisees who believed, saying -- 'It behooves to circumcise them, to command them also to keep the law of Moses.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>And there were gathered together the apostles and the elders, to see about this matter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>and there having been much disputing, Peter having risen up said unto them, 'Men, brethren, you know that from former days, God among us did make choice, through my mouth, for the nations to hear the word of the good news, and to believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>and the heart-knowing God did bare them testimony, having given to them the Holy Spirit, even as also to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>and did put no difference also between us and them, by the faith having purified their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>now, therefore, why do you tempt God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>but, through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, we believe to be saved, even as also they.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>And all the multitude did keep silence, and were hearkening to Barnabas and Paul, declaring as many signs and wonders as God did among the nations through them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>and after they are silent, James answered, saying, 'Men, brethren, hearken to me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon did declare how at first God did look after to take out of the nations a people for His name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>and to this agree the words of the prophets, as it has been written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>After these things I will turn back, and I will build again the tabernacle of David, that is fallen down, and its ruins I will build again, and will set it upright --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>that the residue of men may seek after the Lord, and all the nations, upon whom My name has been called, said the Lord, who is doing all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>'Known from the ages to God are all His works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>therefore I judge: not to trouble those who from the nations do turn back to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but to write to them to abstain from the pollutions of the idols, and the whoredom, and the strangled thing; and the blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>for Moses from former generations in every city has those preaching him -- in the synagogues every sabbath being read.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, chosen men out of themselves to send to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas -- Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brethren --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>having written through their hand thus: 'The apostles, and the elders, and the brethren, to those in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, brethren, who are of the nations, greeting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>seeing we have heard that certain having gone forth from us did trouble you with words, subverting your souls, saying to be circumcised and to keep the law, to whom we did give no charge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>it seemed good to us, having come together with one accord, chosen men to send unto you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>we have sent, therefore, Judas and Silas, and they by word are telling the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>'For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, no more burden to lay upon you, except these necessary things:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>They then, indeed, having been let go, went to Antioch, and having brought the multitude together, did deliver the epistle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>and they having read, did rejoice for the consolation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>Judas also and Silas, being themselves also prophets, through much discourse did exhort the brethren, and confirm,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>and having passed some time, they were let go with peace from the brethren unto the apostles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>and it seemed good to Silas to remain there still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>And Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and proclaiming good news -- with many others also -- the word of the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>and after certain days, Paul said unto Barnabas, 'Having turned back again, we may look after our brethren, in every city in which we have preached the word of the Lord -- how they are.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>And Barnabas counseled to take with them John called Mark,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>and Paul was not thinking it good to take him with them who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and did not go with them to the work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>there came, therefore, a sharp contention, so that they were parted from one another, and Barnabas having taken Mark, did sail to Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>and Paul having chosen Silas, went forth, having been given up to the grace of God by the brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>and he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the assemblies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>And he came to Derbe and Lystra, and lo, a certain disciple was there, by name Timotheus son of a certain woman, a believing Jewess, but of a father, a Greek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>who was well testified to by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>this one did Paul wish to go forth with him, and having taken him, he circumcised him, because of the Jews who are in those places, for they all knew his father -- that he was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they were going on through the cities, they were delivering to them the decrees to keep, that have been judged by the apostles and the elders who are in Jerusalem,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>and having gone through Phrygia and the region of Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>having gone toward Mysia, they were trying to go on toward Bithynia, and the Spirit did not suffer them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>and having passed by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>And a vision through the night appeared to Paul -- a certain man of Macedonia was standing, calling upon him, and saying, 'Having passed through to Macedonia, help us;' --</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>having set sail, therefore, from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, on the morrow also to Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>thence also to Philippi, which is a principal city of the part of Macedonia -- a colony. And we were in this city abiding certain days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>on the sabbath-day also we went forth outside of the city, by a river, where there used to be prayer, and having sat down, we were speaking to the women who came together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>and a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, worshipping God, was hearing, whose heart the Lord did open to attend to the things spoken by Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>and when she was baptized, and her household, she did call upon us, saying, 'If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, having entered into my house, remain;' and she constrained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>And it came to pass in our going on to prayer, a certain maid, having a spirit of Python, did meet us, who brought much employment to her masters by soothsaying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>she having followed Paul and us, was crying, saying, 'These men are servants of the Most High God, who declare to us a way of salvation;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>and this she was doing for many days, but Paul having been grieved, and having turned, said to the spirit, 'I command you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to come forth from her;' and it came forth the same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>And her masters having seen that the hope of their employment was gone, having caught Paul and Silas, drew them to the market-place, unto the rulers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>and having brought them to the magistrates, they said, 'These men do exceedingly trouble our city, being Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and they proclaim customs that are not lawful for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the multitude rose up together against them, and the magistrates having torn their garments from them, were commanding to beat them with rods,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>many blows also having laid upon them, they cast them to prison, having given charge to the jailor to keep them safely,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>who such a charge having received, did put them to the inner prison, and their feet made fast in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>And at midnight Paul and Silas praying, were singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were hearing them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>and suddenly a great earthquake came, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken, opened also presently were all the doors, and of all -- the bands were loosed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>and the jailor having come out of sleep, and having seen the doors of the prison open, having drawn a sword, was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to be fled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>and Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, 'You may not do yourself any harm, for we are all here.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>And, having asked for a light, he sprang in, and trembling he fell down before Paul and Silas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and having brought them forth, said, 'Sirs, what must I do -- that I may be saved?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>and they said, 'Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved -- you and your house;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>and they spake to him the word of the Lord, and to all those in his household;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>and having taken them, in that hour of the night, he did bathe them from the blows, and was baptized, himself and all his presently,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>having brought them also into his house, he set food before them, and was glad with all the household, he having believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And day having come, the magistrates sent the rod-bearers, saying, 'Let those men go;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>and the jailor told these words unto Paul -- 'The magistrates have sent, that you may be let go; now, therefore, having gone forth go on in peace;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>and Paul said to them, 'Having beaten us publicly uncondemned -- men, Romans being -- they did cast us to prison, and now privately do they cast us forth! why no! but having come themselves, let them bring us forth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the rod-bearers told to the magistrates these sayings, and they were afraid, having heard that they are Romans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>and having come, they besought them, and having brought them forth, they were asking them to go forth from the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>and they, having gone forth out of the prison, entered into the house of Lydia, and having seen the brethren, they comforted them, and went forth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>And having passed through Amphipolis, and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>and according to the custom of Paul, he went in unto them, and for three sabbaths he was reasoning with them from the Writings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>opening and alleging, 'That the Christ it behoved to suffer, and to rise again out of the dead, and that this is the Christ -- Jesus whom I proclaim to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And certain of them did believe, and attached themselves to Paul and to Silas, also of the worshipping Greeks a great multitude, of the principal women also not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>And the unbelieving Jews, having been moved with envy, and having taken to them of the loungers certain evil men, and having made a crowd, were setting the city in an uproar; having assailed also the house of Jason, they were seeking them to bring them to the populace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>and not having found them, they drew Jason and certain brethren unto the city rulers, calling aloud -- 'These, having put the world in commotion, are also here present,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>whom Jason has received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying another to be king -- Jesus.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And they troubled the multitude and the city rulers, hearing these things,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>and having taking security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>And the brethren immediately, through the night, sent forth both Paul and Silas to Berea, who having come, went to the synagogue of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>and these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, they received the word with all readiness of mind, every day examining the Writings whether those things were so;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>many, indeed, therefore, of them did believe, and of the honourable Greek women and men not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>And when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that also in Berea was the word of God declared by Paul, they came thither also, agitating the multitudes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>and then immediately the brethren sent forth Paul, to go on as it were to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy were remaining there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And those conducting Paul, brought him unto Athens, and having received a command unto Silas and Timotheus that with all speed they may come unto him, they departed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>and Paul waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred in him, beholding the city wholly given to idolatry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>therefore, indeed, he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the worshipping persons, and in the market-place every day with those who met with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>And certain of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers, were meeting together to see him, and some were saying, 'What would this seed picker wish to say?' and others, 'Of strange demons he does seem to be an announcer;' because Jesus and the rising again he did proclaim to them as good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>having also taken him, unto the Areopagus they brought him, saying, 'Are we able to know what is this new teaching that is spoken by you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>for certain strange things you do bring to our ears? we wish, then, to know what these things would wish to be;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>and all Athenians, and the strangers sojourning, for nothing else were at leisure but to say something, and to hear some newer thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>And Paul, having stood in the midst of the Areopagus, said, 'Men, Athenians, in all things I perceive you as over-religious;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>for passing through and contemplating your objects of worship, I found also an erection on which had been inscribed: To God -- unknown; whom, therefore -- not knowing -- you do worship, this One I announce to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>'God, who did make the world, and all things in it, this One, of heaven and of earth being Lord, in temples made with hands does not dwell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>neither by the hands of men is He served -- needing anything, He giving to all life, and breath, and all things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>He made also of one blood every nation of men, to dwell upon all the face of the earth -- having ordained times before appointed, and the bounds of their dwellings --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>to seek the Lord, if perhaps they did feel after Him and find, -- though, indeed, He is not far from each one of us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>for in Him we live, and move, and are; as also certain of your poets have said: For of Him also we are offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>'Being, therefore, offspring of God, we ought not to think the Godhead to be like to gold, or silver, or stone, graving of art and device of man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>the times, indeed, therefore, of the ignorance God having overlooked, does now command all men everywhere to reform,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because He did set a day in which He is about to judge the world in righteousness, by a man whom He did ordain, having given assurance to all, having raised him out of the dead.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And having heard of a rising again of the dead, some, indeed, were mocking, but others said, 'We will hear you again concerning this;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>and so Paul went forth from the midst of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>and certain men having cleaved to him, did believe, among whom is also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman, by name Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>And after these things, Paul having departed out of Athens, came to Corinth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>and having found a certain Jew, by name Aquilas, of Pontus by birth, lately come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife -- because of Claudius having directed all the Jews to depart out of Rome -- he came to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>and because of being of the same craft, he did remain with them, and was working, for they were tent-makers as to craft;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>and he was reasoning in the synagogue every sabbath, persuading both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia, Paul was pressed in the Spirit, testifying fully to the Jews Jesus the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>and on their resisting and speaking evil, having shaken his garments, he said unto them, 'Your blood is upon your head -- I am clean; henceforth to the nations I will go on.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And having departed thence, he went to the house of a certain one, by name Justus, a worshipper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>and Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue did believe in the Lord with all his house, and many of the Corinthians hearing were believing, and they were being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And the Lord said through a vision in the night to Paul, 'Be not afraid, but be speaking and you may be not silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>because I am with you, and no one shall set on you to do you evil; because I have much people in this city;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>and he continued a year and six months, teaching among them the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>And Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a rush with one accord upon Paul, and brought him unto the tribunal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying -- 'Against the law this one does persuade men to worship God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>and Paul being about to open his mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, 'If, indeed, then, it was anything unrighteous, or an act of wicked profligacy, O Jews, according to reason I had borne with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>but if it is a question concerning words and names, and of your law, look you yourselves to it, for a judge of these things I do not wish to be,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>and he drave them from the tribunal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>and all the Greeks having taken Sosthenes, the chief man of the synagogue, were beating him before the tribunal, and not even for these things was Gallio caring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And Paul having remained yet a good many days, having taken leave of the brethren, was sailing to Syria -- and with him are Priscilla and Aquilas -- having shorn his head in Cenchera, for he had a vow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>and he came down to Ephesus, and did leave them there, and he himself having entered into the synagogue did reason with the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>and they having requested him to remain a longer time with them, he did not consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but took leave of them, saying, 'It behooves me by all means the coming feast to keep at Jerusalem, and again I will return unto you -- God willing.' And he sailed from Ephesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>and having come down to Caesarea, having gone up, and having saluted the assembly, he went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And having made some stay he went forth, going through in order the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>And a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by birth, a man of eloquence, being mighty in the Writings, came to Ephesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>this one was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the Spirit, was speaking and teaching exactly the things about the Lord, knowing only the baptism of John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>this one also began to speak boldly in the synagogue, and Aquilas and Priscilla having heard of him, took him to them, and did more exactly expound to him the way of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>and he being minded to go through into Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, having exhorted them to receive him, who having come, did help them much who have believed through the grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>for powerfully the Jews he was refuting publicly, showing through the Writings Jesus to be the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>And it came to pass, in Apollos' being in Corinth, Paul having gone through the upper parts, came to Ephesus, and having found certain disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>he said unto them, 'The Holy Spirit did you receive -- having believed?' and they said unto him, 'But we did not even hear whether there is any Holy Spirit;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>and he said unto them, 'To what, then, were you baptized?' and they said, 'To John's baptism.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>And Paul said, 'John, indeed, did baptize with a baptism of reformation, saying to the people that in him who is coming after him they should believe -- that is, in the Christ -- Jesus;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>and they, having heard, were baptized -- to the name of the Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>and Paul having laid on them his hands, the Holy Spirit came upon them, they were speaking also with tongues, and prophesying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>and all the men were, as it were, twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>And having gone into the synagogue, he was speaking boldly for three months, reasoning and persuading the things concerning the reign of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>and when certain were hardened and were disbelieving, speaking evil of the way before the multitude, having departed from them, he did separate the disciples, every day reasoning in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this happened for two years so that all those dwelling in Asia did hear the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>mighty works also -- not common -- was God working through the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that even unto the ailing were brought from his body handkerchiefs or aprons, and the sicknesses departed from them; the evil spirits also went forth from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>And certain of the wandering exorcist Jews, took upon them to name over those having the evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, 'We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul does preach;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>and there were certain -- seven sons of Sceva, a Jew, a chief priest -- who are doing this thing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>and the evil spirit, answering, said, 'Jesus I know, and Paul I am acquainted with; and you -- who are you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man, in whom was the evil spirit, leaping upon them, and having overcome them, prevailed against them, so that naked and wounded they did flee out of that house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>and this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who are dwelling at Ephesus, and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was being magnified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>many also of those who did believe were coming, confessing and declaring their acts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>and many of those who had practised the curious arts, having brought the books together, were burning them before all; and they reckoned together the prices of them, and found it five myriads of silverlings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>so powerfully was the word of God increasing and prevailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in the Spirit, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, to go on to Jerusalem, saying -- 'After my being there, it behooves me also to see Rome;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>and having sent to Macedonia two of those ministering to him -- Timotheus and Erastus -- he himself stayed a time in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>And there came, at that time, not a little stir about the way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>for a certain one, Demetrius by name, a worker in silver, making silver sanctuaries of Artemis, was bringing to the artificers gain not a little,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>whom, having brought in a crowd together, and those who did work about such things, he said, 'Men, you know that by this work we have our wealth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>and you see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all Asia, this Paul, having persuaded, did turn away a great multitude, saying, that they are not gods who are made by hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>and not only is this department in danger for us of coming into disregard, but also, that of the great goddess Artemis the temple is to be reckoned for nothing, and also her greatness is about to be brought down, whom all Asia and the world does worship.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And they having heard, and having become full of wrath, were crying out, saying, 'Great is the Artemis of the Ephesians!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>and the whole city was filled with confusion, they rushed also with one accord into the theatre, having caught Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's fellow-travellers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>And on Paul's purposing to enter in unto the populace, the disciples were not suffering him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>and certain also of the chief men of Asia, being his friends, having sent unto him, were entreating him not to venture himself into the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some indeed, therefore, were calling out one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>and out of the multitude they put forward Alexander -- the Jews thrusting him forward -- and Alexander having beckoned with the hand, wished to make defence to the populace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>and having known that he is a Jew, one voice came out of all, for about two hours, crying, 'Great is the Artemis of the Ephesians!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>And the public clerk having quieted the multitude, said, 'Men, Ephesians, why, who is the man that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is a devotee of the great goddess Artemis, and of that which fell down from Zeus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>these things, then, not being to be gainsaid, it is necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>'For you brought these men, who are neither temple-robbers nor speaking evil of your goddess;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>if indeed, therefore, Demetrius and the artificers with him with any one have a matter, court days are held, and there are proconsuls; let them accuse one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>'And if you seek after anything concerning other matters, in the legal assembly it shall be determined;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>for we are also in peril of being accused of insurrection in regard to this day, there being no occasion by which we shall be able to give an account of this concourse;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>and these things having said, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>And after the ceasing of the tumult, Paul having called near the disciples, and having embraced them, went forth to go on to Macedonia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>and having gone through those parts, and having exhorted them with many words, he came to Greece;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>having made also three months' stay -- a counsel of the Jews having been against him -- being about to set forth to Syria, there came to him a resolution of returning through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And there were accompanying him unto Asia, Sopater of Berea, and of Thessalonians Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timotheus, and of Asiatics Tychicus and Trophimus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>these, having gone before, did remain for us in Troas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>and we sailed, after the days of the unleavened food, from Philippi, and came unto them to Troas in five days, where we abode seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And on the first of the week, the disciples having been gathered together to break bread, Paul was discoursing to them, about to depart on the morrow, he was also continuing the discourse till midnight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>and there were many lamps in the upper chamber where they were gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>and there was sitting a certain youth, by name Eutychus, upon the window -- being borne down by a deep sleep, Paul discoursing long -- he having sunk down from the sleep, fell down from the third story, and was lifted up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>And Paul, having gone down, fell upon him, and having embraced him, said, 'Make no tumult, for his life is in him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>and having come up, and having broken bread, and having tasted, for a long time also having talked -- till daylight, so he went forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>and they brought up the lad alive, and were comforted in no ordinary measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>And we having gone before unto the ship, did sail to Assos, thence intending to take in Paul, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go on foot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>and when he met with us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>and thence having sailed, on the morrow we came over-against Chios, and the next day we arrived at Samos, and having remained in Trogyllium, on the following day we came to Miletus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>for Paul decided to sail past Ephesus, that there may not be to him a loss of time in Asia, for he hasted, if it were possible for him, on the day of the Pentecost to be at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>And from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, he called for the elders of the assembly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>and when they were come unto him, he said to them, 'You -- you know from the first day in which I came to Asia, how, with you at all times I was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears, and temptations, that befell me in the counsels of the Jews against me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>how nothing I did keep back of what things are profitable, not to declare to you, and to teach you publicly, and in every house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>testifying fully both to Jews and Greeks, toward God reformation, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>'And now, lo, I -- bound in the Spirit -- go on to Jerusalem, the things that shall befall me in it not knowing,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>but I make account of none of these, neither do I count my life precious to myself, so that I finish my course with joy, and the ministration that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify fully the good news of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>'And now, lo, I have known that no more shall you see my face, -- you all among whom I did go preaching the reign of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>therefore I take you to witness this day, that I am clear from the blood of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>for I did not keep back from declaring to you all the counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>'Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit made you overseers, to feed the assembly of God that He acquired through His own blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>for I have known this, that there shall enter in, after my departing, grievous wolves unto you, not sparing the flock,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>and of your own selves there shall arise men, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>'Therefore, watch, remembering that three years, night and day, I did not cease with tears warning each one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>and now, I commend you, brethren, to God, and to the word of His grace, that is able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among all those sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>'The silver or gold or garments of no one did I covet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>and you yourselves know that to my necessities, and to those who were with me, minister did these hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>all things I did show you, that, thus labouring, it behooves us to partake with the ailing, to be mindful also of the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And these things having said, having bowed his knees, with them all, he did pray,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>and there came a great weeping to all, and having fallen upon the neck of Paul, they were kissing him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>sorrowing most of all for the word that he had said -- that they are about no more to see his face; and they were accompanying him to the ship.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>And it came to pass, at our sailing, having been parted from them, having run direct, we came to Coos, and the succeeding day to Rhodes, and thence to Patara,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>and having found a ship passing over to Phenicia, having gone on board, we sailed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>and having discovered Cyprus, and having left it on the left, we were sailing to Syria, and did land at Tyre, for there was the ship discharging the lading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And having found out the disciples, we tarried there seven days, and they said to Paul, through the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>but when it came that we completed the days, having gone forth, we went on, all bringing us on the way, with women and children, unto the outside of the city, and having bowed the knees upon the shore, we prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>and having embraced one another, we embarked in the ship, and they returned to their own friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And we, having finished the course, from Tyre came down to Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained one day with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>and on the morrow Paul and his company having gone forth, we came to Caesarea, and having entered into the house of Philip the evangelist -- who is of the seven -- we remained with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>and this one had four daughters, virgins, prophesying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And we remaining many more days, there came down a certain one from Judea, a prophet, by name Agabus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>and he having come unto us, and having taken up the girdle of Paul, having bound also his own hands and feet, said, 'Thus said the Holy Spirit, The man whose is this girdle -- so shall the Jews in Jerusalem bind, and they shall deliver him up to the hands of nations.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>And when we heard these things, we called upon him -- both we, and those of that place -- not to go up to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>and Paul answered, 'What do you -- weeping, and crushing mine heart? for I, not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, am ready, for the name of the Lord Jesus;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>and he not being persuaded, we were silent, saying, 'The will of the Lord be done.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>And after these days, having taken our vessels, we were going up to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>and there went also of the disciples from Caesarea with us, bringing with them him with whom we may lodge, a certain Mnason of Cyprus, an aged disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>And we having come to Jerusalem, the brethren did gladly receive us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>and on the morrow Paul was going in with us unto James, all the elders also came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>and having saluted them, he was declaring, one by one, each of the things God did among the nations through his ministration,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>and they having heard, were glorifying the Lord. They said also to him, 'You see, brother, how many myriads there are of Jews who have believed, and all are zealous of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>and they are instructed concerning you, that apostasy from Moses you do teach to all Jews among the nations, saying -- Not to circumcise the children, nor after the customs to walk;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>what then is it? certainly the multitude it behooves to come together, for they will hear that you hast come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>'This, therefore, do that we say to you: We have four men having a vow on themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>these having taken, be purified with them, and be at expense with them, that they may shave the head, and all may know that the things of which they have been instructed concerning you are nothing, but you do walk -- yourself also -- the law keeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>'And concerning those of the nations who have believed, we have written, having given judgment, that they observe no such thing, except to keep themselves both from idol-sacrifices, and blood, and a strangled thing, and whoredom.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul, having taken the men, on the following day, with them having purified himself, was entering into the temple, announcing the fulfillment of the days of the purification, till the offering was offered for each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>And, as the seven days were about to be fully ended, the Jews from Asia having beheld him in the temple, were stirring up all the multitude, and they laid hands upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying out, 'Men, Israelites, help! this is the man who, against the people, and the law, and this place, all everywhere is teaching; and further, also, Greeks he brought into the temple, and has defiled this holy place;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>for they had seen before Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city with him, whom they were supposing that Paul brought into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>All the city also was moved and there was a running together of the people, and having laid hold on Paul, they were drawing him out of the temple, and immediately were the doors shut,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>and they seeking to kill him, a rumour came to the chief captain of the band that all Jerusalem has been thrown into confusion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>who, at once, having taken soldiers and centurions, ran down upon them, and they having seen the chief captain and the soldiers, did leave off beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the chief captain, having come near, took him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains, and was inquiring who he may be, and what it is he has been doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>and some were crying out one thing, and some another, among the multitude, and not being able to know the certainty because of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried to the castle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>and when he came upon the steps, it happened he was borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the multitude,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for the crowd of the people was following after, crying, 'Away with him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And Paul being about to be led into the castle, said to the chief captain, 'Is it permitted to me to say anything unto you?' and he said, 'Greek do you know?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>are not you, then, the Egyptian who before these days made an uprising, and did lead into the desert the four thousand men of the assassins?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>And Paul said, 'I, indeed, am a man, a Jew, of Tarsus of Cilicia, of no mean city a citizen; and I beseech you, suffer me to speak unto the people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And he having given him leave, Paul having stood upon the stairs, did beckon with the hand to the people, and there having been a great silence, he spake unto them in the Hebrew dialect, saying:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>'Men, brethren, and fathers, hear my defence now unto you;' --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>and they having heard that in the Hebrew dialect he was speaking to them, gave the more silence, and he said, --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>'I, indeed, am a man, a Jew, having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, and brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, having been taught according to the exactitude of a law of the fathers, being zealous of God, as all you are to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>'And this way I persecuted unto death, binding and delivering up to prisons both men and women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as also the chief priest does testify to me, and all the eldership; from whom also having received letters unto the brethren, to Damascus, I was going on, to bring also those there bound to Jerusalem that they might be punished,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>and it came to pass, in my going on and coming near to Damascus, about noon, suddenly out of the heaven there shone a great light round about me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>I fell also to the ground, and I heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why me do you persecute?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>'And I answered, Who are you, Lord? and he said unto me, I am Jesus the Nazarene whom you do persecute --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>and they who are with me the light did see, and became afraid, and the voice they heard not of him who is speaking to me --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>and I said, What shall I do, Lord? and the Lord said unto me, Having risen, go on to Damascus, and there it shall be told you concerning all things that have been appointed for you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>'And when I did not see from the glory of that light, being led by the hand by those who are with me, I came to Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>and a certain one, Ananias, a pious man according to the law, being testified to by all the Jews dwelling there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>having come unto me and stood by me, said to me, Saul, brother, look up; and I the same hour did look up to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>and he said, The God of our fathers did choose you beforehand to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and to hear a voice out of his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>because you shall be his witness unto all men of what you hast seen and heard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>and now, why tarry you? having risen, baptize yourself, and wash away your sins, calling upon the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>'And it came to pass when I returned to Jerusalem, and while I was praying in the temple, I came into a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and I saw him saying to me, Haste and go forth in haste out of Jerusalem, because they will not receive your testimony concerning me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>and I said, Lord, they -- they know that I was imprisoning and was scourging in every synagogue those believing on you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>and when the blood of your witness Stephen was being poured forth, I also was standing by and assenting to his death, and keeping the garments of those putting him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>and he said unto me, Go, because to nations far off I will send you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they were hearing him unto this word, and they lifted up their voice, saying, 'Away from the earth with such an one; for it is not fit for him to live.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And they crying out and casting up their garments, and throwing dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, saying, 'By scourges let him be examined;' that he might know for what cause they were crying so against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as he was stretching him with the thongs, Paul said unto the centurion who was standing by, 'A man, a Roman, uncondemned -- is it lawful to you to scourge;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>and the centurion having heard, having gone near to the chief captain, told, saying, 'Take heed what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>and the chief captain having come near, said to him, 'Tell me, are you a Roman?' and he said, 'Yes;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>and the chief captain answered, 'I, with a great sum, did obtain this citizenship;' but Paul said, 'But I have been even born so.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Immediately, therefore, they departed from him who are about to examine him, and the chief captain also was afraid, having learned that he is a Roman, and because he had bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>and on the morrow, intending to know the certainty therefore he is accused by the Jews, he did loose him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their sanhedrin to come, and having brought down Paul, he set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paul having earnestly beheld the sanhedrin, said, 'Men, brethren, I in all good conscience have lived to God unto this day;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>and the chief priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to smite him on the mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>then Paul said unto him, 'God is about to smite you, you whitewashed wall, and you -- you do sit judging me according to the law, and, violating law, do order me to be smitten!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And those who stood by said, 'The chief priest of God do you revile?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>and Paul said, 'I did not know, brethren, that he is chief priest: for it has been written, Of the ruler of your people you shall not speak evil;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>and Paul having known that the one part are Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out in the sanhedrin, 'Men, brethren, I am a Pharisee -- son of a Pharisee -- concerning hope and rising again of dead men I am judged.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And he having spoken this, there came a dissension of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees, and the crowd was divided,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>for Sadducees, indeed, say there is no rising again, nor messenger, nor spirit, but Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there came a great cry, and the scribes of the Pharisees' part having arisen, were striving, saying, 'No evil do we find in this man; and if a spirit spake to him, or a messenger, we may not fight against God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>and a great dissension having come, the chief captain having been afraid lest Paul may be pulled to pieces by them, commanded the soldiery, having gone down, to take him by force out of the midst of them, and to bring him to the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And on the following night, the Lord having stood by him, said, 'Take courage, Paul, for as you did fully testify the things concerning me at Jerusalem, so it behooves you also at Rome to testify.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And day having come, certain of the Jews having made a concourse, did anathematize themselves, saying neither to eat nor to drink till they may kill Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>and they were more than forty who made this conspiracy by oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>who having come near to the chief priests and to the elders said, 'With an anathema we did anathematize ourselves -- to taste nothing till we have killed Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>now, therefore, you, signify you to the chief captain, with the sanhedrin, that to-morrow he may bring him down unto you, as being about to know more exactly the things concerning him; and we, before his coming near, are ready to put him to death.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>And the son of Paul's sister having heard of the lying in wait, having gone and entered into the castle, told Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>and Paul having called near one of the centurions, said, 'This young man lead unto the chief captain, for he has something to tell him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>He indeed, then, having taken him, brought him unto the chief captain, and said, 'The prisoner Paul, having called me near, asked me this young man to bring unto you, having something to say to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the chief captain having taken him by the hand, and having withdrawn by themselves, inquired, 'What is that which you hast to tell me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>and he said -- 'The Jews agreed to request you, that to-morrow to the sanhedrin you may bring down Paul, as being about to enquire something more exactly concerning him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>you, therefore, may you not yield to them, for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who did anathematize themselves -- not to eat nor to drink till they kill him, and now they are ready, waiting for the promise from you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>The chief captain, then, indeed, let the young man go, having charged him to tell no one, 'that these things you did show unto me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>and having called near a certain two of the centurions, he said, 'Make ready soldiers two hundred, that they may go on unto Caesarea, and horsemen seventy, and spearmen two hundred, from the third hour of the night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>beasts also provide, that, having set Paul on, they may bring him safe unto Felix the governor;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>he having written a letter after this description:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>'Claudius Lysias, to the most noble governor Felix, hail:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man having been taken by the Jews, and being about to be killed by them -- having come with the soldiery, I rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>and, intending to know the cause for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their sanhedrin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>whom I found accused concerning questions of their law, and having no accusation worthy of death or bonds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>and a plot having been intimated to me against this man -- about to be of the Jews -- at once I sent unto you, having given command also to the accusers to say the things against him before you; be strong.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>Then, indeed, the soldiers according to that directed them, having taken up Paul, brought him through the night to Antipatris,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>and on the morrow, having suffered the horsemen to go on with him, they returned to the castle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>those having entered into Caesarea, and delivered the letter to the governor, did present also Paul to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And the governor having read it, and inquired of what province he is, and understood that he is from Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>'I will hear you -- said he -- when your accusers also may have come;' he also commanded him to be kept in the praetorium of Herod.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And after five days came down the chief priest Ananias, with the elders, and a certain orator -- Tertullus, and they made manifest to the governor the things against Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>and he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, 'Much peace enjoying through you, and worthy deeds being done to this nation through your forethought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>always, also, and everywhere we receive it, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>and that I may not be further tedious to you, I pray you to hear us concisely in your gentleness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>for having found this man a pestilence, and moving a dissension to all the Jews through the world -- a ringleader also of the sect of the Nazarenes --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>who also the temple did try to profane, whom also we took, and according to our law did wish to judge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>and Lysias the chief captain having come near, with much violence, out of our hands did take away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>having commanded his accusers to come to you, from whom you may be able, yourself having examined, to know concerning all these things of which we accuse him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>and the Jews also agreed, professing these things to be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>And Paul answered -- the governor having beckoned to him to speak -- 'Knowing that for many years you hast been a judge to this nation, the more cheerfully the things concerning myself I do answer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>you being able to know that it is not more than twelve days to me since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>and neither in the temple did they find me reasoning with any one, or making a dissension of the multitude, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>nor are they able to prove against me the things concerning which they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>'And I confess this to you, that, according to the way that they call a sect, so serve I the God of the fathers, believing all things that in the law and the prophets have been written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>having hope toward God, which they themselves also wait for, that there is about to be a rising again of the dead, both of righteous and unrighteous;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>and in this I do exercise myself, to have a conscience void of offence toward God and men always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>'And after many years I came, about to do kind acts to my nation, and offerings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>in which certain Jews from Asia did find me purified in the temple, not with multitude, nor with tumult,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>whom it behooves to be present before you, and to accuse, if they had anything against me,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>except concerning this one voice, in which I cried, standing among them -- Concerning a rising again of the dead I am judged to-day by you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>And having heard these things, Felix delayed them -- having known more exactly of the things concerning the way -- saying, 'When Lysias the chief captain may come down, I will know fully the things concerning you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>having given also a direction to the centurion to keep Paul, to let him also have liberty, and to forbid none of his own friends to minister or to come near to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after certain days, Felix having come with Drusilla his wife, being a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith toward Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>and he reasoning concerning righteousness, and temperance, and the judgment that is about to be, Felix, having become afraid, answered, 'For the present be going, and having got time, I will call for you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>and at the same time also hoping that money shall be given to him by Paul, that he may release him, therefore, also sending for him the oftener, he was conversing with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>and two years having been fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus; Felix also willing to lay a favour on the Jews, left Paul bound.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Festus, therefore, having come into the province, after three days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>and the chief priest and the principal men of the Jews made manifest to him the things against Paul, and were calling on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking favour against him, that he may send for him to Jerusalem, making an ambush to put him to death in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Then, indeed, Festus answered that Paul is kept in Caesarea, and himself is about speedily to go on thither,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>'Therefore those able among you -- said he -- having come down together, if there be anything in this man -- let them accuse him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>and having tarried among them more than ten days, having gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat upon the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>and he having come, there stood round about the Jews who have come down from Jerusalem -- many and weighty charges they are bringing against Paul, which they were not able to prove,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>he making defence -- 'Neither in regard to the law of the Jews, nor in regard to the temple, nor in regard to Caesar -- did I commit any sin.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>And Festus willing to lay on the Jews a favour, answering Paul, said, 'Art you willing, to Jerusalem having gone up, there concerning these things to be judged before me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>and Paul said, 'At the tribunal of Caesar I am standing, where it behooves me to be judged; to Jews I did no unrighteousness, as you do also very well know;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>for if indeed I am unrighteous, and anything worthy of death have done, I deprecate not to die; and if there is none of the things of which these accuse me, no one is able to make a favour of me to them; to Caesar I appeal!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>then Festus, having communed with the council, answered, 'To Caesar you hast appealed; to Caesar you shall go.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And certain days having passed, Agrippa the king, and Bernice, came down to Caesarea saluting Festus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>and as they were continuing there more days, Festus submitted to the king the things concerning Paul, saying, 'There is a certain man, left by Felix, a prisoner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>about whom, in my being at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid information, asking a decision against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>unto whom I answered, that it is not a custom of Romans to make a favour of any man to die, before that he who is accused may have the accusers face to face, and may receive place of defence in regard to the charge laid against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>'They, therefore, having come together -- I, making no delay, on the succeeding day having sat upon the tribunal, did command the man to be brought,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>concerning whom the accusers, having stood up, were bringing against him no accusation of the things I was thinking of,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but certain questions concerning their own religion they had against him, and concerning a certain Jesus who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>and I, doubting in regard to the question concerning this, said, If he would wish to go on to Jerusalem, and there to be judged concerning these things --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>but Paul having appealed to be kept to the hearing of Sebastus, I did command him to be kept till I might send him unto Caesar.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>And Agrippa said unto Festus, 'I was wishing also myself to hear the man;' and he said, 'To-morrow you shall hear him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>on the morrow, therefore -- on the coming of Agrippa and Bernice with much display, and they having entered into the audience chamber, with the chief captains also, and the principal men of the city, and Festus having ordered -- Paul was brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus said, 'King Agrippa, and all men who are present with us, you see this one, about whom all the multitude of the Jews did deal with me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying out, He ought not to live any longer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>and I, having found him to have done nothing worthy of death, and he also himself having appealed to Sebastus, I decided to send him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>concerning whom I have no certain thing to write to my lord, therefore I brought him forth before you, and specially before you, king Agrippa, that the examination having been made, I may have something to write;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>for it does seem to me irrational, sending a prisoner, not also to signify the charges against him.'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>And Agrippa said unto Paul, 'It is permitted to you to speak for yourself;' then Paul having stretched forth the hand, was making a defence:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>'Concerning all things of which I am accused by Jews, king Agrippa, I have thought myself happy, being about to make a defence before you to-day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>especially knowing you to be acquainted with all things -- both customs and questions -- among Jews; therefore, I beseech you, patiently to hear me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>'The manner of my life then, indeed, from youth -- which from the beginning was among my nation, in Jerusalem -- know do all the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>knowing me before from the first, (if they may be willing to testify,) that after the most exact sect of our worship, I lived a Pharisee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>and now for the hope of the promise made to the fathers by God, I have stood judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>to which our twelve tribes, intently night and day serving, do hope to come, concerning which hope I am accused, king Agrippa, by the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>why is it judged incredible with you, if God does raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>'I, indeed, therefore, thought with myself, that against the name of Jesus of Nazareth it behoved me many things to do,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I in prison did shut up, from the chief priests having received the authority; they also being put to death, I gave my vote against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>and in every synagogue, often punishing them, I was constraining them to speak evil, being also exceedingly mad against them, I was also persecuting them even unto strange cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>'In which things, also, going on to Damascus -- with authority and commission from the chief priests --</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>and we all having fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew dialect, Saul, Saul, why me do you persecute? hard for you against pricks to kick!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>'And I said, Who are you, Lord? and he said, I am Jesus whom you do persecute;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>'Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but to those in Damascus first, and to those in Jerusalem, to all the region also of Judea, and to the nations, I was preaching to reform, and to turn back unto God, doing works worthy of reformation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>because of these things the Jews -- having caught me in the temple -- were endeavouring to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>'Having obtained, therefore, help from God, till this day, I have stood witnessing both to small and to great, saying nothing besides the things that both the prophets and Moses spake of as about to come,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And, he thus making a defence, Festus with a loud voice said, 'You are mad, Paul; much learning does turn you mad;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>and he said, 'I am not mad, most noble Festus, but of truth and soberness the sayings I speak forth;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And when our sailing to Italy was determined, they were delivering up both Paul and certain others, prisoners, to a centurion, by name Julius, of the band of Sebastus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>and having embarked in a ship of Adramyttium, we, being about to sail by the coasts of Asia, did set sail, there being with us Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>on the next day also we touched at Sidon, and Julius, courteously treating Paul, did permit him, having gone on unto friends, to receive their care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And thence, having set sail, we sailed under Cyprus, because of the winds being contrary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>and having sailed over the sea over-against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myria of Lycia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria, sailing to Italy, did put us into it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>and having sailed slowly many days, and with difficulty coming over-against Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over-against Salmone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>and hardly passing it, we came to a certain place called 'Fair Havens,' near to which was the city of Lasaea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And much time being spent, and the sailing being now dangerous -- because of the fast also being already past -- Paul was admonishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>saying to them, 'Men, I perceive that with hurt, and much damage, not only of the lading and of the ship, but also of our lives -- the voyage is about to be;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>but the centurion to the pilot and to the ship owner gave credence more than to the things spoken by Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>and the haven being incommodious to winter in, the more part gave counsel to sail thence also, if by any means they might be able, having attained to Phenice, there to winter, which is a haven of Crete, looking to the south-west and north-west,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>and a south wind blowing softly, having thought they had obtained their purpose, having lifted anchor, they sailed close by Crete,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>and not long after there arose against it a tempestuous wind, that is called Euroclydon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>and the ship being caught, and not being able to bear up against the wind, having given her up, we were borne on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>and having run under a certain little isle, called Clauda, we were hardly able to become masters of the boat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>which having taken up, they were using helps, undergirding the ship, and fearing lest they may fall on the quicksand, having let down the mast -- so were borne on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And we, being exceedingly tempest-tossed, the succeeding day they were making a clearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>and on the third day with our own hands the tackling of the ship we cast out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>and neither sun nor stars appearing for more days, and not a little tempest lying upon us, thenceforth all hope was taken away of our being saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>And there having been long fasting, then Paul having stood in the midst of them, said, 'It behoved you, indeed, O men -- having hearkened to me -- not to set sail from Crete, and to save this hurt and damage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>and now I exhort you to be of good cheer, for there shall be no loss of life among you -- but of the ship;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>for there stood by me this night a messenger of God -- whose I am, and whom I serve --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, Be not afraid Paul; before Caesar it behooves you to stand; and, lo, God has granted to you all those sailing with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>therefore be of good cheer, men! for I believe God, that so it shall be, even as it has been spoken to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>and on a certain island it behooves us to be cast.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>And when the fourteenth night came -- we being borne up and down in the Adria -- toward the middle of the night the sailors were supposing that some country drew near to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>and having sounded they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and again having sounded, they found fifteen fathoms,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>and fearing lest on rough places we may fall, out of the stern having cast four anchors, they were wishing day to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>And the sailors seeking to flee out of the ship, and having let down the boat to the sea, in pretence as if out of the foreship they are about to cast anchors,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, 'If these do not remain in the ship -- you are not able to be saved;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>then the soldiers did cut off the ropes of the boat, and suffered it to fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And till the day was about to be, Paul was calling upon all to partake of nourishment, saying, 'Fourteen days to-day, waiting, you continue fasting, having taken nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>therefore I call upon you to take nourishment, for this is for your safety, for of not one of you shall a hair from the head fall;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>and having said these things, and having taken bread, he gave thanks to God before all, and having broken it, he began to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>and all having become of good cheer, themselves also took food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>(and we were -- all the souls in the ship -- two hundred, seventy and six),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>and having eaten sufficient nourishment, they were lightening the ship, casting forth the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when the day came, they were not discerning the land, but a certain creek were perceiving having a beach, into which they took counsel, if possible, to thrust forward the ship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>and the anchors having taken up, they were committing it to the sea, at the same time -- having loosed the bands of the rudders, and having hoisted up the mainsail to the wind -- they were making for the shore,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>and having fallen into a place of two seas, they ran the ship aground, and the fore-part, indeed, having stuck fast, did remain immoveable, but the hinder-part was broken by the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the soldiers' counsel was that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one having swam out should escape,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>but the centurion, wishing to save Paul, hindered them from the counsel, and did command those able to swim, having cast themselves out first -- to get unto the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and the rest, some indeed upon boards, and some upon certain things of the ship; and thus it came to pass that all came safe unto the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And having been saved, then they knew that the island is called Melita,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>and the foreigners were showing us no ordinary kindness, for having kindled a fire, they received us all, because of the pressing rain, and because of the cold;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>but Paul having gathered together a quantity of sticks, and having laid them upon the fire, a viper -- out of the heat having come -- did fasten on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the foreigners saw the beast hanging from his hand, they said unto one another, 'Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, having been saved out of the sea, the justice did not suffer to live;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>he then, indeed, having shaken off the beast into the fire, suffered no evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>and they were expecting him to be about to be inflamed, or to fall down suddenly dead, and they, expecting it a long time, and seeing nothing uncommon happening to him, changing their minds, said he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>And in the neighborhood of that place were lands of the principal man of the island, by name Publius, who, having received us, three days did courteously lodge us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>and it came to pass, the father of Publius with feverish heats and dysentery pressed, was laid, unto whom Paul having entered, and having prayed, having laid his hands on him, healed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>this, therefore, being done, the others also in the island having infirmities were coming and were healed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>who also with many honours did honour us, and we setting sail -- they were lading us with the things that were necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And after three months, we set sail in a ship (that had wintered in the isle) of Alexandria, with the sign Dioscuri,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>and having landed at Syracuse, we remained three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>thence having gone round, we came to Rhegium, and after one day, a south wind having sprung up, the second day we came to Puteoli;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where, having found brethren, we were called upon to remain with them seven days, and thus to Rome we came;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>and thence, the brethren having heard the things concerning us, came forth to meet us, unto Appii Forum, and Three Taverns -- whom Paul having seen, having given thanks to God, took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered up the prisoners to the captain of the barrack, but Paul was suffered to remain by himself, with the soldier guarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And it came to pass after three days, Paul called together those who are the principal men of the Jews, and they having come together, he said unto them: 'Men, brethren, I -- having done nothing contrary to the people, or to the customs of the fathers -- a prisoner from Jerusalem, was delivered up to the hands of the Romans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, having examined me, were wishing to release me, because of their being no cause of death in me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>and the Jews having spoken against it, I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar -- not as having anything to accuse my nation of;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>for this cause, therefore, I called for you to see and to speak with you, for because of the hope of Israel with this chain I am bound.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said unto him, 'We did neither receive letters concerning you from Judea, nor did any one who came of the brethren declare or speak any evil concerning you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>and we think it good from you to hear what you do think, for, indeed, concerning this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>and having appointed him a day, they came, more of them unto him, to the lodging, to whom he was expounding, testifying fully the reign of God, persuading them also of the things concerning Jesus, both from the law of Moses, and the prophets, from morning till evening,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>and, some, indeed, were believing the things spoken, and some were not believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And not being agreed with one another, they were going away, Paul having spoken one word -- 'Well did the Holy Spirit speak through Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying, Go on unto this people and say, With hearing you shall hear, and you shall not understand, and seeing you shall see, and you shall not perceive,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>for made gross was the heart of this people, and with the ears they heard heavily, and their eyes they did close, lest they may see with the eyes, and with the heart may understand, and be turned back, and I may heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>'Be it known, therefore, to you, that to the nations was sent the salvation of God, these also will hear it;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>and he having said these things, the Jews went away, having much disputation among themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>and Paul remained an entire two years in his own hired house, and was receiving all those coming in unto him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>preaching the reign of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness -- unforbidden.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who is marked out Son of God in power, according to the Spirit of sanctification, by the rising again from the dead,) Jesus Christ our Lord;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>because, having known God they did not glorify Him as God, nor gave thanks, but were made vain in their reasonings, and their unintelligent heart was darkened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>professing to be wise, they were made fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into the likeness of an image of corruptible man, and of fowls, and of quadrupeds, and of reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore also God did give them up, in the desires of their hearts, to uncleanness, to dishonour their bodies among themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>who did change the truth of God into a falsehood, and did honour and serve the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed to the ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>Because of this did God give them up to dishonorable affections, for even their females did change the natural use into that against nature;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>and in like manner also the males having left the natural use of the female, did burn in their longing toward one another; males with males working shame, and the recompense of their error that was fit, in themselves receiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And, according as they did not approve of having God in knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things not seemly;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>and to him who is working, the reward is not reckoned of grace, but of debt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>and to him who is not working, and is believing upon Him who is declaring righteous the impious, his faith is reckoned -- to righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>even as David also does speak of the happiness of the man to whom God does reckon righteousness apart from works:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Is this happiness, then, upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcision -- for we say that the faith was reckoned to Abraham -- to righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>how then was it reckoned? he being in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>and a sign he did receive of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith in the uncircumcision, for his being father of all those believing through uncircumcision, for the righteousness also being reckoned to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and father of circumcision to those not of circumcision only, but who also walk in the steps of the faith, that is in the uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Because of this it is of faith, that it may be according to grace, for the promise being sure to all the seed, not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>who is father of us all (according as it has been written -- 'A father of many nations I have set you,') before Him whom he did believe -- God, who is quickening the dead, and is calling the things that be not as being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>Who, against hope in hope did believe, for his becoming father of many nations according to that spoken: 'So shall your seed be;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>and not having been weak in the faith, he did not consider his own body, already become dead, (being about a hundred years old,) and the deadness of Sarah's womb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>and at the promise of God did not stagger in unbelief, but was strengthened in faith, having given glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and having been fully persuaded that what He has promised He is able also to do:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>therefore also it was reckoned to him to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>And it was not written on his account alone, that it was reckoned to him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Having been declared righteous, then, by faith, we have peace toward God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>through whom also we have the access by the faith into this grace in which we have stood, and we boast on the hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only so, but we also boast in the tribulations, knowing that the tribulation does work endurance;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For in our being still ailing, Christ in due time did die for the impious;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>for scarcely for a righteous man will any one die, for the good man perhaps some one also does dare to die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>and God does commend His own love to us, that, in our being still sinners, Christ did die for us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>much more, then, having been declared righteous now in his blood, we shall be saved through him from the wrath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>for if, being enemies, we have been reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved in his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so, but we are also boasting in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we did receive the reconciliation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>because of this, even as through one man the sin did enter into the world, and through the sin the death; and thus to all men the death did pass through, for that all did sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>for till law sin was in the world: and sin is not reckoned when there is not law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>but the death did reign from Adam till Moses, even upon those not having sinned in the likeness of Adam's transgression, who is a type of him who is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But, not as the offence so also is the free gift; for if by the offence of the one the many did die, much more did the grace of God, and the free gift in grace of the one man Jesus Christ, abound to the many;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>and not as through one who did sin is the free gift, for the judgment indeed is of one to condemnation, but the gift is of many offences to a declaration of 'Righteous,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>for if by the offence of the one the death did reign through the one, much more those, who the abundance of the grace and of the free gift of the righteousness are receiving, in life shall reign through the one -- Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>So, then, as through one offence to all men it is to condemnation, so also through one declaration of 'Righteous' it is to all men to justification of life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>for as through the disobedience of the one man, the many were constituted sinners: so also through the obedience of the one, shall the many be constituted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>And law came in, that the offence might abound, and where the sin did abound, the grace did overabound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>that even as the sin did reign in the death, so also the grace may reign, through righteousness, to life age-during, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What, then, shall we say? shall we continue in the sin that the grace may abound?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>are you ignorant that we, as many as were baptized to Christ Jesus, to his death were baptized?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>we were buried together, then, with him through the baptism to the death, that even as Christ was raised up out of the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we in newness of life might walk.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>this knowing, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of the sin may be made useless, for our no longer serving the sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>for he who has died has been set free from the sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>And if we died with Christ, we believe that we also shall live with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that Christ, having been raised up out of the dead, does no more die, death over him has no more lordship;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Are you ignorant, brethren -- for to those knowing law I speak -- that the law has lordship over the man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>for the married woman to the living husband has been bound by law, and if the husband may die, she has been free from the law of the husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>so, then, the husband being alive, an adulteress she shall be called if she may become another man's; and if the husband may die, she is free from the law, so as not to be an adulteress, having become another man's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>So that, my brethren, you also were made dead to the law through the body of the Christ, for your becoming another's, who out of the dead was raised up, that we might bear fruit to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>for when we were in the flesh, the passions of the sins, that are through the law, were working in our members, to bear fruit to the death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>and now we have ceased from the law, that being dead in which we were held, so that we may serve in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What, then, shall we say? the law is sin? let it not be! but the sin I did not know except through law, for also the covetousness I had not known if the law had not said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>'You shall not covet;' and the sin having received an opportunity, through the command, did work in me all covetousness -- for apart from law sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>And I was alive apart from law once, and the command having come, the sin revived, and I died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>and the command that is for life, this was found by me for death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>for the sin, having received an opportunity, through the command, did deceive me, and through it did slay me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>so that the law, indeed, is holy, and the command holy, and righteous, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>That which is good then, to me has it become death? let it not be! but the sin, that it might appear sin, through the good, working death to me, that the sin might become exceeding sinful through the command,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>for we have known that the law is spiritual, and I am fleshly, sold by the sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>for that which I work, I do not acknowledge; for not what I will, this I practise, but what I hate, this I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>And if what I do not will, this I do, I consent to the law that it is good,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>and now it is no longer I that work it, but the sin dwelling in me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>for I have known that there does not dwell in me, that is, in my flesh, good: for to will is present with me, and to work that which is right I do not find,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>for the good that I will, I do not; but the evil that I do not will, this I practise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>And if what I do not will, this I do, it is no longer I that work it, but the sin that is dwelling in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find, then, the law, that when I desire to do what is right, with me the evil is present,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>for I delight in the law of God according to the inward man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>and I behold another law in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and bringing me into captivity to the law of the sin that is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>A wretched man I am! who shall deliver me out of the body of this death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God -- through Jesus Christ our Lord; so then, I myself indeed with the mind do serve the law of God, and with the flesh, the law of sin.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is, then, now no condemnation to those in Christ Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>for the law of the Spirit of the life in Christ Jesus did set me free from the law of the sin and of the death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>for what the law was not able to do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, His own Son having sent in the likeness of sinful flesh, and for sin, did condemn the sin in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>that the righteousness of the law may be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For those who are according to the flesh, the things of the flesh do mind; and those according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>for the mind of the flesh is death, and the mind of the Spirit -- life and peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>because the mind of the flesh is enmity to God, for to the law of God it does not subject itself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>for neither is it able; and those who are in the flesh are not able to please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>And you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God does dwell in you; and if any one has not the Spirit of Christ -- this one is not His;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>and if Christ is in you, the body, indeed, is dead because of sin, and the Spirit is life because of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>and if the Spirit of Him who did raise up Jesus out of the dead does dwell in you, He who did raise up the Christ out of the dead shall quicken also your dying bodies, through His Spirit dwelling in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>So, then, brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>for if according to the flesh you do live, you are about to die; and if, by the Spirit, the deeds of the body you put to death, you shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>for as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>for you did not receive a spirit of bondage again for fear, but you did receive a spirit of adoption in which we cry, 'Abba -- Father.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit himself does testify with our spirit, that we are children of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>and if children, also heirs, heirs, indeed, of God, and heirs together of Christ -- if, indeed, we suffer together, that we may also be glorified together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I reckon that the sufferings of the present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory about to be revealed in us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>for the earnest looking out of the creation does expect the revelation of the sons of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>for to vanity was the creation made subject -- not of its will, but because of Him who did subject it -- in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that also the creation itself shall be set free from the servitude of the corruption to the liberty of the glory of the children of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>for we have known that all the creation does groan together, and does travail in pain together till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only so, but also we ourselves, having the first-fruit of the Spirit, we also ourselves in ourselves do groan, adoption expecting -- the redemption of our body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>for in hope we were saved, and hope beheld is not hope; for what any one does behold, why also does he hope for it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>and if what we do not behold we hope for, through continuance we expect it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>And, in like manner also, the Spirit does help our weaknesses; for, what we may pray for, as it behooves us, we have not known, but the Spirit himself does make intercession for us with groanings unutterable,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>and He who is searching the hearts has known what is the mind of the Spirit, because according to God he does intercede for saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>And we have known that to those loving God all things do work together for good, to those who are called according to purpose;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>because whom He did foreknow, He also did fore-appoint, conformed to the image of His Son, that he might be first-born among many brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>and whom He did fore-appoint, these also He did call; and whom He did call, these also He declared righteous; and whom He declared righteous, these also He did glorify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What, then, shall we say unto these things? if God is for us, who is against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He who indeed His own Son did not spare, but for us all did deliver him up, how shall He not also with him the all things grant to us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall lay a charge against the choice ones of God? God is He that is declaring righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>who is he that is condemning? Christ is He that died, yea, rather also, was raised up; who is also on the right hand of God -- who also does intercede for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of the Christ? tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>(according as it has been written -- 'For Your sake we are put to death all the day long, we were reckoned as sheep of slaughter,')</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>but in all these we more than conquer, through him who loved us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>for I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor messengers, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor things about to be, nor height, nor depth, nor any other created thing, shall be able to separate us from the love of God, that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>Truth I say in Christ, I lie not, my conscience bearing testimony with me in the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>that I have great grief and unceasing pain in my heart --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>for I was wishing, I myself, to be anathema from the Christ -- for my brethren, my kindred, according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.4'>who are Israelites, whose is the adoption, and the glory, and the covenants, and the lawgiving, and the service, and the promises,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.5'>whose are the fathers, and of whom is the Christ, according to the flesh, who is over all, God blessed to the ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.6'>And it is not possible that the word of God has failed; for not all who are of Israel are these Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.7'>nor because they are seed of Abraham are all children, but -- 'in Isaac shall a seed be called to you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.8'>that is, the children of the flesh -- these are not children of God; but the children of the promise are reckoned for seed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.9'>for the word of promise is this; 'According to this time I will come, and there shall be to Sarah a son.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.10'>And not only so, but also Rebecca, having conceived by one -- Isaac our father --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.11'>(for they being not yet born, neither having done anything good or evil, that the purpose of God, according to choice, might remain; not of works, but of Him who is calling,) it was said to her --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.12'>'The greater shall serve the less;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>according as it has been written, 'Jacob I did love, and Esau I did hate.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>What, then, shall we say? unrighteousness is with God? let it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.15'>for to Moses He says, 'I will do kindness to whom I do kindness, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.16'>so, then -- not of him who is willing, nor of him who is running, but of God who is doing kindness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.17'>for the Writing says to Pharaoh -- 'For this very thing I did raise you up, that I might show in you My power, and that My name might be declared in all the land;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>so, then, to whom He wills, He does kindness, and to whom He wills, He does harden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>You will say, then, to me, 'Why yet does He find fault? for His counsel who has resisted?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>nay, but, O man, who are you that are answering again to God? shall the thing formed say to Him who did form it, Why me did you make thus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>has not the potter authority over the clay, out of the same lump to make the one vessel to honour, and the one to dishonour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>And if God, willing to show the wrath and to make known His power, did endure, in much long suffering, vessels of wrath fitted for destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>and that He might make known the riches of His glory on vessels of kindness, that He before prepared for glory, whom also He did call -- us --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>not only out of Jews, but also out of nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.25'>as also in Hosea He says, 'I will call what is not My people -- My people; and her not beloved -- Beloved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.26'>and it shall be -- in the place where it was said to them, You are not My people; there they shall be called sons of the living God.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.27'>And Isaiah does cry concerning Israel, 'If the number of the sons of Israel may be as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.28'>for a matter He is finishing, and is cutting short in righteousness, because a matter cut short will the Lord do upon the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.29'>and according as Isaiah says before, 'Except the Lord of Sabaoth did leave to us a seed, as Sodom we had become, and as Gomorrah we had been made like.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.30'>What, then, shall we say? that nations who are not pursuing righteousness did attain to righteousness, and righteousness that is of faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.31'>and Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, at a law of righteousness did not arrive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>therefore? because -- not by faith, but as by works of law; for they did stumble at the stone of stumbling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.33'>according as it has been written, 'Lo, I place in Sion a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence; and every one who is believing thereon shall not be ashamed.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>Brethren, the pleasure indeed of my heart, and my supplication that is to God for Israel, is -- for salvation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>for I bear them testimony that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>for not knowing the righteousness of God, and their own righteousness seeking to establish, to the righteousness of God they did not submit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is an end of law for righteousness to every one who is believing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>for Moses does describe the righteousness that is of the law, that, 'The man who did them shall live in them,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>and the righteousness of faith does thus speak: 'You may not say in thine heart, Who shall go up to the heaven,' that is, Christ to bring down?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.7'>or, 'Who shall go down to the abyss,' that is, Christ out of the dead to bring up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>But what does it say? 'Near you is the saying -- in your mouth, and in your heart:' that is, the saying of the faith, that we preach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>that if you may confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus, and may believe in your heart that God did raise him out of the dead, you shall be saved,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>for with the heart does one believe to righteousness, and with the mouth is confession made to salvation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>for the Writing says, 'Every one who is believing on him shall not be ashamed,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>for there is no difference between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all is rich to all those calling upon Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>for every one -- whoever shall call upon the name of the Lord, he shall be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>How then shall they call upon him in whom they did not believe? and how shall they believe on him of whom they did not hear? and how shall they hear apart from one preaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>and how shall they preach, if they may not be sent? according as it has been written, 'How beautiful the feet of those proclaiming good tidings of peace, of those proclaiming good tidings of the good things!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But they were not all obedient to the good tidings, for Isaiah says, 'Lord, who did give credence to our report?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>so then the faith is by a report, and the report through a saying of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>but I say, Did they not hear? yes, indeed -- 'to all the earth their voice went forth, and to the ends of the habitable world their sayings.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I say, Did not Israel know? first Moses says, 'I will provoke you to jealousy by that which is not a nation; by an unintelligent nation I will anger you,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>and Isaiah is very bold, and says, 'I was found by those not seeking Me; I became manifest to those not inquiring after Me;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>and unto Israel He says, 'All the day I did stretch out My hands unto a people unbelieving and gainsaying.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>I say, then, Did God cast away His people? let it not be! for I also am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God did not cast away His people whom He knew before; have you not known -- in Elijah -- what the Writing says? how he does plead with God concerning Israel, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>'Lord, Your prophets they did kill, and Your altars they dug down, and I was left alone, and they seek my life;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>but what says the divine answer to him? 'I left to Myself seven thousand men, who did not bow a knee to Baal.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.5'>So then also in the present time a remnant according to the choice of grace there has been;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.6'>and if by grace, no more of works, otherwise the grace becomes no more grace; and if of works, it is no more grace, otherwise the work is no more work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What then? What Israel does seek after, this it did not obtain, and the chosen did obtain, and the rest were hardened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>according as it has been written, 'God gave to them a spirit of deep sleep, eyes not to see, and ears not to hear,' -- unto this very day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.9'>and David says, 'Let their table become for a snare, and for a trap, and for a stumbling-block, and for a recompense to them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.10'>let their eyes be darkened -- not to behold, and their back do You always bow down.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>I say, then, Did they stumble that they might fall? let it not be! but by their fall the salvation is to the nations, to arouse them to jealousy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>and if the fall of them is the riches of a world, and the diminution of them the riches of nations, how much more the fulness of them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>For to you I speak -- to the nations -- inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle of nations, my ministration I do glorify;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>if by any means I shall arouse to jealousy mine own flesh, and shall save some of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>for if the casting away of them is a reconciliation of the world, what the reception -- if not life out of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>and if the first-fruit is holy, the lump also; and if the root is holy, the branches also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>And if certain of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, wast graffed in among them, and a fellow-partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree did become --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.18'>do not boast against the branches; and if you do boast, you do not bear the root, but the root you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>You will say, then, 'The branches were broken off, that I might be graffed in;' right!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>by unbelief they were broken off, and you have stood by faith; be not high-minded, but be fearing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>for if God the natural branches did not spare -- lest perhaps He also shall not spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Lo, then, goodness and severity of God -- upon those indeed who fell, severity; and upon you, goodness, if you may remain in the goodness, otherwise, you also shall be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And those also, if they may not remain in unbelief, shall be graffed in, for God is able again to graff them in;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>for if you, out of the olive tree, wild by nature, wast cut out, and, contrary to nature, wast graffed into a good olive tree, how much rather shall they, who are according to nature, be graffed into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I do not wish you to be ignorant, brethren, of this secret -- that you may not be wise in your own conceits -- that hardness in part to Israel has happened till the fulness of the nations may come in;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>and so all Israel shall be saved, according as it has been written, 'There shall come forth out of Sion he who is delivering, and he shall turn away impiety from Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.27'>and this to them is the covenant from Me, when I may take away their sins.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.28'>As regards, indeed, the good tidings, they are enemies on your account; and as regards the choice -- beloved on account of the fathers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.29'>for unrepented of are the gifts and the calling of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>for as you also once did not believe in God, and now did find kindness by the unbelief of these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.31'>so also these now did not believe, that in your kindness they also may find kindness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.32'>for God did shut up together the whole to unbelief, that to the whole He might do kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.33'>O depth of riches, and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable His judgments, and untraceable His ways!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For I say, through the grace that was given to me, to every one who is among you, not to think above what it behooves to think; but to think so as to think wisely, as to each God did deal a measure of faith,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.18'>If possible -- so far as in you -- with all men being in peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.19'>not avenging yourselves, beloved, but give place to the wrath, for it has been written, 'Vengeance is Mine,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>Let every soul to the higher authorities be subject, for there is no authority except from God, and the authorities existing are appointed by God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>so that he who is setting himself against the authority, against God's ordinance has resisted; and those resisting, to themselves shall receive judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For those ruling are not a terror to the good works, but to the evil; and do you wish not to be afraid of the authority? that which is good be doing, and you shall have praise from it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>for of God it is a ministrant to you for good; and if that which is evil you may do, be fearing, for not in vain does it bear the sword; for of God it is a ministrant, an avenger for wrath to him who is doing that which is evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only because of the wrath, but also because of the conscience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>for because of this also pay you tribute; for servants of God they are, on this very thing attending continually;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>render, therefore, to all their dues; to whom tribute, the tribute; to whom custom, the custom; to whom fear, the fear; to whom honour, the honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>To no one owe anything, except to love one another; for he who is loving the other -- law he has fulfilled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>for, 'You shall not commit adultery, You shall do no murder, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false testimony, You shall not covet;' and if there is any other command, in this word it is summed up, in this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>the love to the neighbor does work no ill; the love, therefore, is the fulness of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>And this, knowing the time, that for us, the hour already is to be aroused out of sleep, for now nearer is our salvation than when we did believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>the night did advance, and the day came nigh; let us lay aside, therefore, the works of the darkness, and let us put on the armour of the light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>as in day-time, let us walk becomingly; not in revellings and drunkennesses, not in chamberings and lasciviousnesses, not in strife and emulation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.14'>but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ, and for the flesh take no forethought -- for desires.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>let not him who is eating despise him who is not eating: and let not him who is not eating judge him who is eating, for God did receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>You -- who are you that are judging another's domestic? to his own master he does stand or fall; and he shall be made to stand, for God is able to make him stand.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who is regarding the day, to the Lord he does regard it, and he who is not regarding the day, to the Lord he does not regard it. He who is eating, to the Lord he does eat, for he does give thanks to God; and he who is not eating, to the Lord he does not eat, and does give thanks to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>For none of us to himself does live, and none to himself does die;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>for both, if we may live, to the Lord we live; if also we may die, to the Lord we die; both then if we may live, also if we may die, we are the Lord's;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>And you, why do you judge your brother? or again, you, why do you set at nought your brother? for we shall all stand at the tribunal of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.11'>for it has been written, 'I live! says the Lord -- to Me bow shall every knee, and every tongue shall confess to God;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>no longer, therefore, may we judge one another, but this judge you rather, not to put a stumbling-stone before the brother, or an offence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>I have known, and am persuaded, in the Lord Jesus, that nothing is unclean of itself, except to him who is reckoning anything to be unclean -- to that one it is unclean;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>and if through victuals your brother is grieved, no more do you walk according to love; do not with your victuals destroy that one for whom Christ died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not, then, your good be evil spoken of,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>for the reign of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>for he who in these things is serving the Christ, is acceptable to God and approved of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>So, then, the things of peace may we pursue, and the things of building up one another;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>for the sake of victuals cast not down the work of God; all things, indeed, are pure, but evil is to the man who is eating through stumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>Right it is not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor to do anything in which your brother does stumble, or is made to fall, or is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>You have faith! To yourself have it before God; happy is he who is not judging himself in what he does approve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.23'>and he who is making a difference, if he may eat, has been condemned, because it is not of faith; and all that is not of faith is sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.18'>for I will not dare to speak anything of the things that Christ did not work through me, to obedience of nations, by word and deed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.19'>in power of signs and wonders, in power of the Spirit of God; so that I, from Jerusalem, and in a circle as far as Illyricum, have fully preached the good news of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.20'>and so counting it honour to proclaim good news, not where Christ was named -- that upon another's foundation I might not build --</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>when I may go on to Spain I will come unto you, for I hope in going through, to see you, and by you to be set forward thither, if of you first, in part, I shall be filled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>for I decided not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>and I, in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling, was with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>and my word and my preaching was not in persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>that your faith may not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>And wisdom we speak among the perfect, and wisdom not of this age, nor of the rulers of this age -- of those becoming useless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>but we speak the hidden wisdom of God in a secret, that God foreordained before the ages to our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which no one of the rulers of this age did know, for if they had known, the Lord of the glory they would not have crucified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>but, according as it has been written, 'What eye did not see, and ear did not hear, and upon the heart of man came not up, what God did prepare for those loving Him --'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>but to us did God reveal them through His Spirit, for the Spirit all things does search, even the depths of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>for who of men have known the things of the man, except the spirit of the man that is in him? so also the things of God no one has known, except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>And we the spirit of the world did not receive, but the Spirit that is of God, that we may know the things conferred by God on us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>which things also we speak, not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Holy Spirit, with spiritual things spiritual things comparing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>and the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for to him they are foolishness, and he is not able to know them, because spiritually they are discerned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>and he who is spiritual, does discern indeed all things, and he himself is by no one discerned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>for who did know the mind of the Lord that he shall instruct Him? and we -- we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brethren, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly -- as to babes in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>with milk I fed you, and not with meat, for you were not yet able, but not even yet are you now able,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for yet you are fleshly, for where there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are you not fleshly, and in the manner of men do walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>for when one may say, 'I, indeed, am of Paul;' and another, 'I -- of Apollos;' are you not fleshly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who, then, is Paul, and who Apollos, but ministrants through whom you did believe, and to each as the Lord gave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God was giving growth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>so that neither is he who is planting anything, nor he who is watering, but He who is giving growth -- God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>and he who is planting and he who is watering are one, and each his own reward shall receive, according to his own labour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>for of God we are fellow-workmen; God's tillage, God's building you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God that was given to me, as a wise master-builder, a foundation I have laid, and another does build on it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>for other foundation no one is able to lay except that which is laid, which is Jesus the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>and if any one does build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>of each the work shall become manifest, for the day shall declare it, because in fire it is revealed, and the work of each, what kind it is, the fire shall prove;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>if of any one the work does remain that he built on it, a wage he shall receive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>if of any the work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; and himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>have you not known that you are a sanctuary of God, and the Spirit of God does dwell in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>if any one the sanctuary of God does waste, him shall God waste; for the sanctuary of God is holy, the which you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself; if any one does seem to be wise among you in this age -- let him become a fool, that he may become wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>for the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God, for it has been written, 'Who is taking the wise in their craftiness;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, 'The Lord does know the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>So then, let no one glory in men, for all things are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things about to be -- all are yours,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so reckon us as officers of Christ, and stewards of the secrets of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>and as to the rest, it is required in the stewards that one may be found faithful,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>and to me it is for a very little thing that by you I may be judged, or by man's day, but not even myself do I judge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>for of nothing to myself have I been conscious, but not in this have I been declared right -- and he who is discerning me is the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>so, then, nothing before the time judge you, till the Lord may come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of the darkness, and will manifest the counsels of the hearts, and then the praise shall come to each from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>And these things, brethren, I did transfer to myself and to Apollos because of you, that in us you may learn not to think above that which has been written, that you may not be puffed up one for one against the other,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>for who does make you to differ? and what have you, that you did not receive? and if you did also receive, why do you glory as not having received?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Already you are having been filled, already you were rich, apart from us you did reign, and I would also you did reign, that we also with you may reign together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>for I think that God did set forth us the apostles last -- as appointed to death, because a spectacle we became to the world, and messengers, and men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>we are fools because of Christ, and you wise in Christ; we are ailing, and you strong; you glorious, and we dishonoured;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>unto the present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and wander about,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and labour, working with our own hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we suffer;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being spoken evil of, we entreat; as filth of the world we did become -- of all things an offscouring -- till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>Not as putting you to shame do I write these things, but as my beloved children I do admonish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>for if a myriad of child-conductors you may have in Christ, yet not many fathers; for in Christ Jesus, through the good news, I -- I did beget you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>I call upon you, therefore, become you followers of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>because of this I sent to you Timotheus, who is my child, beloved and faithful in the Lord, who shall remind you of my ways in Christ, according as everywhere in every assembly I teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>And as if I were not coming unto you certain were puffed up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>but I will come quickly unto you, if the Lord may will, and I will know not the word of those puffed up, but the power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>for not in word is the reign of God, but in power?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>what do you wish? with a rod shall I come unto you, or in love, with a spirit also of meekness?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>Whoredom is actually heard of among you, and such whoredom as is not even named among the nations -- as that one has the wife of the father! --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>and you are having been puffed up, and did not rather mourn, that he may be removed out of the midst of you who did this work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>for I indeed, as being absent as to the body, and present as to the spirit, have already judged, as being present, him who so wrought this thing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ -- you being gathered together, also my spirit -- with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>to deliver up such a one to the Adversary for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Not good is your glorying; have you not known that a little leaven the whole lump does leaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, according as you are unleavened, for also our passover for us was sacrificed -- Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>so that we may keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of evil and wickedness, but with unleavened food of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I did write to you in the epistle, not to keep company with whoremongers --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>and not certainly with the whoremongers of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or idolaters, seeing you ought then to go forth out of the world --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>and now, I did write to you not to keep company with him, if any one, being named a brother, may be a whoremonger, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner -- with such a one not even to eat together;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>for what have I also those without to judge? those within do you not judge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>and those without God does judge; and put you away the evil from among yourselves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any one of you, having a matter with the other, go to be judged before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>have you not known that the saints shall judge the world? and if by you the world is judged, are you unworthy of the smaller judgments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>have you not known that we shall judge messengers? why not then the things of life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>of the things of life, indeed, then, if you may have judgment, those despised in the assembly -- these cause you to sit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>unto your shame I speak: so there is not among you one wise man, not even one, who shall be able to discern in the midst of his brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>but brother with brother does go to be judged, and this before unbelievers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Already, indeed, then, there is altogether a fault among you, that you have judgments with one another; wherefore do you not rather suffer injustice? wherefore be you not rather defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>but you -- you do injustice, and you defraud, and these -- brethren!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>have you not known that the unrighteous the reign of God shall not inherit? be not led astray; neither whoremongers, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor sodomites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, the reign of God shall inherit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And certain of you were these! but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were declared righteous, in the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not profitable; all things are lawful to me, but I -- I will not be under authority by any;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>the meats are for the belly, and the belly for the meats. And God both this and these shall make useless; and the body is not for whoredom, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>and God both the Lord did raise, and us will raise up through His power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Have you not known that your bodies are members of Christ? having taken, then, the members of the Christ, shall I make them members of an harlot? let it be not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>have you not known that he who is joined to the harlot is one body? 'for they shall be -- says He -- the two for one flesh.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>flee the whoredom; every sin -- whatever a man may commit -- is without the body, and he who is committing whoredom, against his own body does sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>Have you not known that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit in you, which you have from God? and you are not your own,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>for you were bought with a price; glorify, then, God in your body and in your spirit, which are God's.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>And concerning the things of which you wrote to me: good it is for a man not to touch a woman,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>and because of the whoredom let each man have his own wife, and let each woman have her proper husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>to the wife let the husband the due benevolence render, and in like manner also the wife to the husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>the wife over her own body has not authority, but the husband; and, in like manner also, the husband over his own body has not authority, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Defraud not one another, except by consent for a time, that you may be free for fasting and prayer, and again may come together, that the Adversary may not tempt you because of your incontinence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>and this I say by way of concurrence -- not of command,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>for I wish all men to be even as I myself am; but each his own gift has of God, one indeed thus, and one thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>And I say to the unmarried and to the widows: it is good for them if they may remain even as I am;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>and if they have not continence -- let them marry, for it is better to marry than to burn;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>and to the married I announce -- not I, but the Lord -- let not a wife separate from a husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>but and if she may separate, let her remain unmarried, or to the husband let her be reconciled, and let not a husband send away a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>And to the rest I speak -- not the Lord -- if any brother has a wife unbelieving, and she is pleased to dwell with him, let him not send her away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>and a woman who has a husband unbelieving, and he is pleased to dwell with her, let her not send him away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>for the unbelieving husband has been sanctified in the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified in the husband; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>And, if the unbelieving does separate himself -- let him separate himself: the brother or the sister is not under servitude in such cases, and in peace has God called us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>for what, have you known, O wife, whether the husband you shalt save? or what, have you known, O husband, whether the wife you shalt save?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>if not, as God did distribute to each, as the Lord has called each -- so let him walk; and thus in all the assemblies do I direct:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>being circumcised -- was any one called? let him not become uncircumcised; in uncircumcision was any one called? let him not be circumcised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>the circumcision is nothing, and the uncircumcision is nothing -- but a keeping of the commands of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Each in the calling in which he was called -- in this let him remain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>a servant -- wast you called? be not anxious; but if also you are able to become free -- use it rather;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>for he who is in the Lord -- having been called a servant -- is the Lord's freedman: in like manner also he the freeman, having been called, is servant of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>with a price you were bought, become not servants of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>each, in that in which he was called, brethren, in this let him remain with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>And concerning the virgins, a command of the Lord I have not; and I give judgment as having obtained kindness from the Lord to be faithful:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>I suppose, therefore, this to be good because of the present necessity, that it is good for a man that the matter be thus: --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Have you been bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed; have you been loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But and if you may marry, you did not sin; and if the virgin may marry, she did not sin; and such shall have tribulation in the flesh: and I spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>And this I say, brethren, the time henceforth is having been shortened -- that both those having wives may be as not having;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and those weeping, as not weeping; and those rejoicing, as not rejoicing; and those buying, as not possessing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those using this world, as not using it up; for passing away is the fashion of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>And I wish you to be without anxiety; the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, how he shall please the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>and the married is anxious for the things of the world, how he shall please the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>The wife and the virgin have been distinguished: the unmarried is anxious for the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit, and the married is anxious for the things of the world, how she shall please the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>And this for your own profit I say: not that I may cast a noose upon you, but for the seemliness and devotedness to the Lord, undistractedly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>and if any one does think it to be unseemly to his virgin, if she may be beyond the bloom of age, and it ought so to be, what he wills let him do; he does not sin -- let him marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>And he who has stood stedfast in the heart -- not having necessity -- and has authority over his own will, and this he has determined in his heart -- to keep his own virgin -- does well;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>so that both he who is giving in marriage does well, and he who is not giving in marriage does better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife has been bound by law as long time as her husband may live, and if her husband may sleep, she is free to be married to whom she will -- only in the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>and she is happier if she may so remain -- according to my judgment; and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>And concerning the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that we all have knowledge: knowledge puffs up, but love builds up;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>and if any one does love God, this one has been known by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>Concerning the eating then of the things sacrificed to idols, we have known that an idol is nothing in the world, and that there is no other God except one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.5'>for even if there are those called gods, whether in heaven, whether upon earth -- as there are gods many and lords many --</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in an assembly I wish to speak five words through my understanding, that others also I may instruct, rather than myriads of words in an unknown tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, become not children in the understanding, but in the evil be you babes, and in the understanding become you perfect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>in the law it has been written, that, 'With other tongues and with other lips I will speak to this people, and not even so will they hear Me, says the Lord;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What then is it, brethren? whenever you may come together, each of you has a psalm, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation? let all things be for building up;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>and that which you do sow, not the body that shall be do you sow, but bare grain, it may be of wheat, or of some one of the others,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>and God does give to it a body according as He willed, and to each of the seeds its proper body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is one flesh of men, and another flesh of beasts, and another of fishes, and another of birds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>and there are heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but one is the glory of the heavenly, and another that of the earthly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>one glory of sun, and another glory of moon, and another glory of stars, for star from star does differ in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the rising again of the dead: it is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>it is sown in dishonour, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised in power;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body; there is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>so also it has been written, 'The first man Adam became a living creature,' the last Adam is for a life-giving spirit,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man is out of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord out of heaven;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren with me, to the assemblies of Galatia:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>for neither did I from man receive it, nor was I taught it, but through a revelation of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>for you did hear of my behaviour once in Judaism, that exceedingly I was persecuting the assembly of God, and wasting it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>and I was advancing in Judaism above many equals in age in mine own race, being more abundantly zealous of my fathers' deliverances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>and when God was well pleased -- having separated me from the womb of my mother, and having called me through His grace --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal His Son in me, that I might proclaim him good news among the nations, immediately I conferred not with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>nor did I go up to Jerusalem unto those who were apostles before me, but I went away to Arabia, and again returned to Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>then, after three years I went up to Jerusalem to enquire about Peter, and remained with him fifteen days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>and other of the apostles I did not see, except James, the brother of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>And the things that I write to you, lo, before God -- I lie not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>then I came to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>and was unknown by face to the assemblies of Judea, that are in Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>and only they were hearing, that 'he who is persecuting us then, do now proclaim good news -- the faith that then he was wasting;'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then, after fourteen years again I went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, having taken with me also Titus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>and I went up by revelation, and did submit to them the good news that I preach among the nations, and privately to those esteemed, lest in vain I might run or did run;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>but not even Titus, who is with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>and that because of the false brethren brought in unawares, who did come in privily to spy out our liberty that we have in Christ Jesus, that us they might bring under bondage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>to whom not even for an hour we gave place by subjection, that the truth of the good news might remain to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>And from those who were esteemed to be something -- whatever they were then, it makes no difference to me -- the face of man God accepts not, for -- to me those esteemed did add nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but, on the contrary, having seen that I have been entrusted with the good news of the uncircumcision, as Peter with that of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>for He who did work with Peter to the apostleship of the circumcision, did work also in me in regard to the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and having known the grace that was given to me, James, and Cephas, and John, who were esteemed to be pillars, a right hand of fellowship they did give to me, and to Barnabas, that we to the nations, and they to the circumcision may go,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>only, of the poor that we should be mindful, which also I was diligent -- this very thing -- to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>And when Peter came to Antioch, to the face I stood up against him, because he was blameworthy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>for before the coming of certain from James, with the nations he was eating, and when they came, he was withdrawing and separating himself, fearing those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>and dissemble with him also did the other Jews, so that also Barnabas was carried away by their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they are not walking uprightly to the truth of the good news, I said to Peter before all, 'If you, being a Jew, in the manner of the nations do live, and not in the manner of the Jews, how the nations do you compel to Judaize?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>we by nature Jews, and not sinners of the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>having known also that a man is not declared righteous by works of law, if not through the faith of Jesus Christ, also we in Christ Jesus did believe, that we might be declared righteous by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law, wherefore declared righteous by works of law shall be no flesh.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>And if, seeking to be declared righteous in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is then Christ a ministrant of sin? let it not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>for if the things I threw down, these again I build up, a transgressor I set myself forth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>for I through law, did die, that to God I may live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>with Christ I have been crucified, and live no more do I, and Christ does live in me; and that which I now live in the flesh -- in the faith I live of the Son of God, who did love me and did give himself for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not make void the grace of God, for if righteousness be through law -- then Christ died in vain.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O thoughtless Galatians, who did bewitch you, not to obey the truth -- before whose eyes Jesus Christ was described before among you crucified?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>so many things did you suffer in vain! if, indeed, even in vain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>according as Abraham did believe God, and it was reckoned to him -- to righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>know you, then, that those of faith -- these are sons of Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>and the Writing having foreseen that by faith God does declare righteous the nations did proclaim before the good news to Abraham --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>'Blessed in you shall be all the nations;' so that those of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>for as many as are of works of law are under a curse, for it has been written, 'Cursed is every one who is not remaining in all things that have been written in the Book of the Law -- to do them,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>and that in law no one is declared righteous with God, is evident, because 'The righteous by faith shall live;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>and the law is not by faith, but -- 'The man who did them shall live in them.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ did redeem us from the curse of the law, having become for us a curse, for it has been written, 'Cursed is every one who is hanging on a tree,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>that to the nations the blessing of Abraham may come in Christ Jesus, that the promise of the Spirit we may receive through the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, as a man I say it, even of man a confirmed covenant no one does make void or does add to,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>and to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed; He does not say, 'And to seeds,' as of many, but as of one, 'And to thy seed,' which is Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>and this I say, A covenant confirmed before by God to Christ, the law, that came four hundred and thirty years after, does not set aside, to make void the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>for if by law be the inheritance, it is no more by promise, but to Abraham through promise did God grant it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why, then, the law? on account of the transgressions it was added, till the seed might come to which the promise has been made, having been set in order through messengers in the hand of a mediator --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>and the mediator is not of one, and God is one --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>the law, then, is against the promises of God? -- let it not be! for if a law was given that was able to make alive, truly by law there would have been the righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>but the Writing did shut up the whole under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ may be given to those believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>And before the coming of the faith, under law we were being kept, shut up to the faith about to be revealed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>so that the law became our child-conductor -- to Christ, that by faith we may be declared righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>and the faith having come, no more under a child-conductor are we,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>for you are all sons of God through the faith in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>for as many as to Christ were baptized did put on Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>there is not here Jew or Greek, there is not here servant nor freeman, there is not here male and female, for all you are one in Christ Jesus;</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>And I say, so long time as the heir is a babe, he differs nothing from a servant -- being lord of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under tutors and stewards till the time appointed of the father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>so also we, when we were babes, under the elements of the world were in servitude,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>and when the fulness of time did come, God sent forth His Son, come of a woman, come under law,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>and because you are sons, God did send forth the spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father!'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.1.3'>I give thanks to my God upon all the remembrance of you,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.1.5'>for your contribution to the good news from the first day till now,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.6'>having been confident of this very thing, that He who did begin in you a good work, will perform it till a day of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.7'>according as it is righteous for me to think this in behalf of you all, because of my having you in the heart, both in my bonds, and in the defence and confirmation of the good news, all of you being fellow-partakers with me of grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.8'>For God is my witness, how I long for you all in the bowels of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.9'>and this I pray, that your love yet more and more may abound in full knowledge, and all judgment,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.1.11'>being filled with the fruit of righteousness, that is through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.1.12'>And I wish you to know, brethren, that the things concerning me, rather to an advancement of the good news have come,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.1.14'>and the greater part of the brethren in the Lord, having confidence by my bonds, are more abundantly bold -- fearlessly to speak the word.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>For, let this mind be in you that is also in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.7'>but did empty himself, the form of a servant having taken, in the likeness of men having been made,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>and in fashion having been found as a man, he humbled himself, having become obedient unto death -- death even of a cross,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>wherefore, also, God did highly exalt him, and gave to him a name that is above every name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that in the name of Jesus every knee may bow -- of heavenlies, and earthlies, and what are under the earth --</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>because of this do you also rejoice and joy with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>And I hope, in the Lord Jesus, Timotheus to send quickly to you, that I also may be of good spirit, having known the things concerning you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>for I have no one like-minded, who sincerely for the things concerning you will care,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>for the whole seek their own things, not the things of the Christ Jesus,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>and I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall quickly come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>And I thought it necessary Epaphroditus -- my brother, and fellow-workman, and fellow-soldier, and your apostle and servant to my need -- to send unto you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>seeing he was longing after you all, and in heaviness, because you heard that he ailed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>for he also ailed nigh to death, but God did deal kindly with him, and not with him only, but also with me, that sorrow upon sorrow I might not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>The more eagerly, therefore, I did send him, that having seen him again you may rejoice, and I may be the less sorrowful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and hold such in honour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because on account of the work of the Christ he drew near to death, having hazarded the life that he might fill up your deficiency of service unto me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>As many, therefore, as are perfect -- let us think this, and if in anything you think otherwise, this also shall God reveal to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>but to what we have come -- by the same rule walk, the same thing think;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>become followers together of me, brethren, and observe those thus walking, according as you have us -- a pattern;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always praying for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>having heard of your faith in Christ Jesus, and of the love that is to all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>because of the hope that is laid up for you in the heavens, which you heard of before in the word of the truth of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which is present to you, as also in all the world, and is bearing fruit, as also in you, from the day in which you heard, and knew the grace of God in truth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>as you also learned from Epaphras, our beloved fellow-servant, who is for you a faithful minister of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>who also did declare to us your love in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>Because of this, we also, from the day in which we heard, do not cease praying for you, and asking that you may be filled with the full knowledge of His will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>to your walking worthily of the Lord to all pleasing, in every good work being fruitful, and increasing to the knowledge of God,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>who is the image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>because in him were the all things created, those in the heavens, and those upon the earth, those visible, and those invisible, whether thrones, whether lordships, whether principalities, whether authorities; all thing s through him, and for him, have been created,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>and himself is before all, and the all things in him have consisted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And himself is the head of the body -- the assembly -- who is a beginning, a first-born out of the dead, that he might become in all things -- himself -- first,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if also you remain in the faith, being founded and settled, and not moved away from the hope of the good news, which you heard, which was preached in all the creation that is under the heaven, of which I became -- I Paul -- a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>I now rejoice in my sufferings for you, and do fill up the things lacking of the tribulations of the Christ in my flesh for his body, which is the assembly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>of which I -- I did become a minister according to the dispensation of God, that was given to me for you, to fulfil the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>the secret that has been hid from the ages and from the generations, but now was manifested to his saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>to whom God did will to make known what is the riches of the glory of this secret among the nations -- which is Christ in you, the hope of the glory,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>For I wish you to know how great a conflict I have for you and those in Laodicea, and as many as have not seen my face in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that their hearts may be comforted, being united in love, and to all riches of the full assurance of the understanding, to the full knowledge of the secret of the God and Father, and of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are all the treasures of the wisdom and the knowledge hid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>and this I say, that no one may beguile you in enticing words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>for if even in the flesh I am absent -- yet in the spirit I am with you, joying and beholding your order, and the stedfastness of your faith in regard to Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>as, then, you did receive Christ Jesus the Lord, in him walk you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>being rooted and built up in him, and confirmed in the faith, as you were taught -- abounding in it in thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>See that no one shall be carrying you away as spoil through the philosophy and vain deceit, according to the deliverance of men, according to the rudiments of the world, and not according to Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>because in him does tabernacle all the fulness of the Godhead bodily,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>and you are in him made full, who is the head of all principality and authority,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>in whom also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the sins of the flesh in the circumcision of the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>being buried with him in the baptism, in which also you rose with him through the faith of the working of God, who did raise him out of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you -- being dead in the trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh -- He made alive together with him, having forgiven you all the trespasses,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>having stripped the principalities and the authorities, he made a shew of them openly -- having triumphed over them in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>Let no one, then, judge you in eating or in drinking, or in respect of a feast, or of a new moon, or of sabbaths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are a shadow of the coming things, and the body is of the Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>let no one beguile you of your prize, delighting in humble-mindedness and in worship of the messengers, intruding into the things he has not seen, being vainly puffed up by the mind of his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding the head, from which all the body -- through the joints and bands gathering supply, and being knit together -- may increase with the increase of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>If, then, you did die with the Christ from the rudiments of the world, why, as living in the world, are you subject to ordinances?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>-- you may not touch, nor taste, nor handle --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>which are all for destruction with the using, after the commands and teachings of men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>which are, indeed, having a matter of wisdom in will-worship, and humble-mindedness, and neglecting of body -- not in any honour, unto a satisfying of the flesh.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>If, then, you were raised with the Christ, the things above seek you, where the Christ is, on the right hand of God seated,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>the things above mind you, not the things upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>for you did die, and your life has been hid with the Christ in God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>when the Christ -- our life -- may be manifested, then also we with him shall be manifested in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Put to death, then, your members that are upon the earth -- whoredom, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and the covetousness, which is idolatry --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>because of which things cometh the anger of God upon the sons of the disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>in which also you -- you did walk once, when you lived in them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>but now put off, even you, the whole -- anger, wrath, malice, evil-speaking, filthy talking -- out of your mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>Lie not one to another, having put off the old man with his practices,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and having put on the new, which is renewed in regard to knowledge, after the image of Him who did create him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there is not Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, foreigner, Scythian, servant, freeman -- but the all and in all -- Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Put on, therefore, as choice ones of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercies, kindness, humble-mindedness, meekness, long-suffering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>forbearing one another, and forgiving each other, if any one with any one may have a quarrel, as also the Christ did forgive you -- so also you;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>and let the peace of God rule in your hearts, to which also you were called in one body, and become thankful.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>unceasingly remembering of you the work of the faith, and the labour of the love, and the endurance of the hope, of our Lord Jesus Christ, in the presence of our God and Father,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>for you became imitators, brethren, of the assemblies of God that are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because such things you suffered, even you, from your own countrymen, as also they from the Jews,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to the fathers in the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the ages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the highest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become so much better than the messengers, as he did inherit a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the messengers said He ever, 'My Son you are -- I to-day have begotten you?' and again, 'I will be to him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world, He says, 'And let them bow before him -- all messengers of God;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>and unto the messengers, indeed, He says, 'Who is making His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>and unto the Son: 'Your throne, O God, is to the age of the age; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of your reign;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>you did love righteousness, and did hate lawlessness; because of this did He anoint you -- God, your God -- with oil of gladness above your partners;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>and, 'You, at the beginning, Lord, the earth did found, and a work of your hands are the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>these shall perish, and You do remain, and all, as a garment, shall become old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and as a mantle You shall roll them together, and they shall be changed, and You are the same, and Your years shall not fail.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>And unto which of the messengers said He ever, 'Sit at My right hand, till I may make your enemies your footstool?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Because of this it benefits us more abundantly to take heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>for if the word being spoken through messengers did become stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive a just recompense,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation? which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord -- by those having heard was confirmed to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders, and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to His will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For not to messengers did He subject the coming world, concerning which we speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, 'What is man, that You are mindful of him, or a son of man, that You do look after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You did make him some little less than messengers, with glory and honour You did crown him, and did set him over the works of Your hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>all things You did put in subjection under his feet,' for in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things subjected to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>and him who was made some little less than messengers we see -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for every one he might taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was becoming to Him, because of whom are the all things, and through whom are the all things, many sons to glory bringing, the author of their salvation through sufferings to make perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified are all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying, 'I will declare Your name to my brethren, in the midst of an assembly I will sing praise to You;' and again, 'I will be trusting on Him;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>and again, 'Behold I and the children that God did give to me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the same, that through death he might destroy him having the power of death -- that is, the devil --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death, throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>for, doubtless, of messengers it does not lay hold, but of seed of Abraham it lays hold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>therefore it did behoove him in all things to be made like to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling, consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession, Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in all his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>for of more glory than Moses has this one been counted worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house has he who does build it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all things did build is God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>and Moses indeed was stedfast in all his house, as an attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, (as the Holy Spirit says, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>you may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of the temptation in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and saw My works forty years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>therefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- !')</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>but exhort you one another every day, while the To-day is called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of the sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>in its being said, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear, you may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did come out of Egypt through Moses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His rest, except to those who did not believe? --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>and we see that they were not able to enter in because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they, but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in those who heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He said, 'So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the world,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh day thus: 'And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and in this place again, 'If they shall enter into My rest -- ;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>since then, it remains for certain to enter into it, and those who did first hear good news entered not in because of unbelief --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again He does limit a certain day, 'To-day,' (in David saying, after so long a time,) as it has been said, 'To-day, if His voice you may hear, you may not harden your hearts,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning another day have spoken after these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>there does remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his works, as God from His own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow, and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him, but all things are naked and open to His eyes -- with whom is our reckoning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the profession,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathize with our infirmities, but one tempted in all things in like manner -- apart from sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for seasonable help.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every chief priest -- out of men taken -- in behalf of men is set in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since himself also is compassed with infirmity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people, so also for himself to offer for sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>and no one to himself does take the honour, but he who is called by God, as also Aaron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief priest, but He who spake unto him: 'My Son you are, I to-day have begotten you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>as also in another place He says, 'You are a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong crying and tears -- having offered up, and having been heard in respect to that which he feared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>through being a Son, did learn by the things which he suffered -- the obedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and having been made perfect, he did become to all those obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to the order of Melchisedek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard explanation to say, since you have become dull of hearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again you have need that one teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God, and you have become having need of milk, and not of strong food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>for every one who is partaking of milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both of good and of evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, having left the word of the beginning of the Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith on God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>and this we will do, if God may permit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>for it is impossible for those once enlightened, having tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the coming age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and having fallen away, again to renew them to reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of God, and exposed to public shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of whom also it is dressed, does partake of blessing from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>and that which is bearing thorns and briers is disapproved of, and near to cursing, whose end is for burning;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus we speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the labour of the love, that you showed to His name, having ministered to the saints and ministering;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>and we desire each one of you the same diligence to show, unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that you may not become slothful, but followers of those who through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, 'Blessing indeed I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the promise;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all controversy to them for confirmation is the oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>in which God, more abundantly willing to show to the heirs of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that through two immutable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and stedfast, and entering into that within the vail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus, after the order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of the kings, and did bless him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first, indeed, being interpreted, 'King of righteousness,' and then also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like to the Son of God, does remain a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>And see how great this one is, to whom also a tenth Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he has blessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is blessed --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there he, who is testified to that he was living,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving tithes, has paid tithes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the law a change does come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>for he of whom these things are said in another tribe has had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>for it is evident that out of Judah has arisen our Lord, in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to the similitude of Melchisedek there does arise another priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but according to the power of an endless life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>for He does testify -- 'You are a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>for a disannulling indeed does come of the command going before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And inasmuch as it is not apart from oath, (for those indeed apart from oath are become priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him, 'The Lord sware, and will not repent, You are a priest -- to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much of a better covenant has Jesus become surety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>and those indeed are many who have become priests, because by death they are hindered from remaining;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, has the priesthood not transient,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>whence also he is able to save to the very end, those coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless, undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who has no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>for the law does appoint men chief priests, having infirmity, but the word of the oath that is after the law appoints the Son -- to the age having been perfected.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>And the sum concerning the things spoken of is: we have such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the throne of the greatness in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle, which the Lord did set up, and not man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is appointed, whence it is necessary for this one to have also something that he may offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest -- (there being the priests who are offering according to the law, the gifts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly things, as Moses has been divinely warned, being about to construct the tabernacle, for 'See (said He) you may make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mount;') --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>and now he has obtained a more excellent service, how much also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better promises has been sanctioned,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>for if that first were faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault, He says to them, 'Lo, days come, says the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah, a new covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers, in the day of My taking them by their hand, to bring them out of the land of Egypt -- because they did not remain in My covenant, and I did not regard them, says the Lord, --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>because this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel, after those days, says the Lord, giving My laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them, and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me for a people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his brother, saying, Know you the Lord, because they shall all know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;' --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>in the saying 'new,' He has made the first old, and what does become obsolete and is old is near disappearing.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances of service, also a worldly sanctuary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence -- which is called 'Holy;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called 'Holy of holies,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid all round about with gold, in which is the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of the covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>And these things having been thus prepared, into the first tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in, performing the services,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>and into the second, once in the year, only the chief priest, not apart from blood, which he does offer for himself and the errors of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet has been manifested the way of the holy places, the first tabernacle having yet a standing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>which is a simile in regard to the present time, in which both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands -- that is, not of this creation --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during redemption having obtained;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an heifer, sprinkling those defiled, does sanctify to the purifying of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God) purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator, that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise of the age-during inheritance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>for where a covenant is, the death of the covenant-victim to come in is necessary,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>for a covenant over dead victims is stedfast, since it is no force at all when the covenant-victim lives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>whence not even the first apart from blood has been initiated,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>for every command having been spoken, according to law, by Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, 'This is the blood of the covenant that God enjoined unto you,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with blood in like manner he did sprinkle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>and with blood almost all things are purified according to the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness does not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It is necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself, now to be manifested in the presence of God for us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief priest does enter into the holy places every year with blood of others;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he has been manifested;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this -- judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall appear, to those waiting for him -- to salvation!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law having a shadow of the coming good things -- not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make perfect those coming near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once been purified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>but in those sacrifices is a remembrance of sins every year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore, coming into the world, he said, 'Sacrifice and offering You did not will, and a body You did prepare for me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, You did not delight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it has been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Your will;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>saying above -- 'Sacrifice, and offering, and burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering You did not will, nor delight in,' -- which according to the law are offered --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then he said, 'Lo, I come to do, O God, Your will;' he does take away the first that the second he may establish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>in the which will we are having been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>and every priest, indeed, has stood daily serving, and the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies as his footstool,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>for by one offering he has perfected to the end those sanctified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>and testify to us also does the Holy Spirit, for after that He has said before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>'This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and upon their minds I will write them,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>and 'their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no more;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>and where forgiveness of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>which way he did initiate for us -- new and living, through the vail, that is, his flesh --</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and a high priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and having the body bathed with pure water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope, (for faithful is He who did promise),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a custom of certain is, but exhorting, and so much the more as you see the day coming near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins does there remain a sacrifice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery zeal, about to devour the opposers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from mercies, by two or three witnesses, does die,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified, and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>for we have known Him who is saying, 'Vengeance is Mine, I will recompense, says the Lord;' and again, 'The Lord shall judge His people;' --</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so living,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>for also with my bonds you sympathized, and the robbery of your goods with joy you did receive, knowing that you have in yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.1'>Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the choice sojourners of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.2'>according to a foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, to obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.3'>Blessed is the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who, according to the abundance of His kindness did beget us again to a living hope, through the rising again of Jesus Christ out of the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.4'>to an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and unfading, reserved in the heavens for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.5'>who, in the power of God are being guarded, through faith, unto salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>in which you are glad, a little now, if it be necessary, being made to sorrow in manifold trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>that the proof of your faith -- much more precious than of gold that is perishing, and through fire being approved -- may be found to praise, and honour, and glory, in the revelation of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>whom, not having seen, you love, in whom, now not seeing and believing, you are glad with joy unspeakable and glorified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>receiving the end of your faith -- salvation of souls;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>concerning which salvation seek out and search out did prophets who concerning the grace toward you did prophecy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching in regard to what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ that was in them was manifesting, testifying beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glory after these,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>to whom it was revealed, that not to themselves, but to us they were ministering these, which now were told to you (through those who did proclaim good news to you,) in the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, to which things messengers do desire to bend looking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore having girded up the loins of your mind, being sober, hope perfectly upon the grace that is being brought to you in the revelation of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves to the former desires in your ignorance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but according as He who did call you is holy, you also, become holy in all behaviour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it has been written, 'Become you holy, because I am holy;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.17'>and if on the Father you do call, who without acceptance of persons is judging according to the work of each, in fear the time of your sojourn pass you,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.19'>but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and unspotted -- Christ's --</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.20'>foreknown, indeed, before the foundation of the world, and manifested in the last times because of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.21'>who through him do believe in God, who did raise out of the dead, and glory to him did give, so that your faith and hope may be in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.22'>Your souls having purified in the obedience of the truth through the Spirit to brotherly love unfeigned, out of a pure heart one another love you earnestly,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.24'>because all flesh is as grass, and all glory of man as flower of grass; wither did the grass, and the flower of it fell away,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Having put aside, then, all evil, and all guile, and hypocrisies, and envyings, and all evil speakings,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>and you yourselves, as living stones, are built up, a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>Therefore, also, it is contained in the Writing: 'Lo, I lay in Zion a chief corner-stone, choice, precious, and he who is believing on him may not be put to shame;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.7'>to you, then, who are believing is the preciousness; and to the unbelieving, a stone that the builders disapproved of, this one did become for the head of a corner,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence -- who are stumbling at the word, being unbelieving, -- to which also they were set;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>and you are a choice race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people acquired, that the excellences you may show forth of Him who out of darkness did call you to His wondrous light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>who were once not a people, and are now the people of God; who had not found kindness, and now have found kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I call upon you, as strangers and sojourners, to keep from the fleshly desires, that war against the soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having your behaviour among the nations right, that in that which they speak against you as evil-doers, of the good works having beheld, they may glorify God in a day of inspection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Be subject, then, to every human creation, because of the Lord, whether to a king, as the highest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>whether to governors, as to those sent through him, for punishment, indeed, of evil-doers, and a praise of those doing good;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>because, so is the will of God, doing good, to put to silence the ignorance of the foolish men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, and not having the freedom as the cloak of the evil, but as servants of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>to all give you honour; the brotherhood love you; God fear you; the king honour you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>The domestics! be subjecting yourselves in all fear to the masters, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>for this is gracious, if because of conscience toward God any one does endure sorrows, suffering unrighteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>for what renown is it, if sinning and being buffeted, you do endure it? but if, doing good and suffering for it, you do endure, this is gracious with God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>for to this you were called, because Christ also did suffer for you, leaving to you an example, that you may follow his steps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>who did not commit sin, nor was guile found in his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who being reviled -- was not reviling again, suffering -- was not threatening, and was committing himself to Him who is judging righteously,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who our sins himself did bear in his body, upon the tree, that to the sins having died, to the righteousness we may live; by whose stripes you were healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>for you were as sheep going astray, but you turned back now to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>In like manner, the wives, be you subject to your own husbands, that even if certain are disobedient to the word, through the conversation of the wives, without the word, they may be won,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>whose adorning -- let it not be that which is outward, of plaiting of hair, and of putting around of things of gold, or of putting on of garments,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him 'sir,' of whom you did become daughters, doing good, and not fearing any terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>The husbands, in like manner, dwelling with them, according to knowledge, as to a weaker vessel -- to the wife -- imparting honour, as also being heirs together of the grace of life, that your prayers be not hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>And finally, being all of one mind, having fellow-feeling, loving as brethren, compassionate, courteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not giving back evil for evil, or railing for railing, and on the contrary, blessing, having known that to this you were called, that a blessing you may inherit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>for 'he who is willing to love life, and to see good days, let him guard his tongue from evil, and his lips -- not to speak guile;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>because the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and His ears -- to their supplication, and the face of the Lord is upon those doing evil;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>and who is he who will be doing you evil, if of Him who is good you may become imitators?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>but if you also should suffer because of righteousness, happy are you! and of their fear be not afraid, nor be troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>and the Lord God sanctify in your hearts. And be ready always for defence to every one who is asking of you an account concerning the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience, that in that in which they speak against you as evil-doers, they may be ashamed who are traducing your good behaviour in Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>for it is better doing good, if the will of God will it, to suffer, than doing evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>because also Christ once for sin did suffer -- righteous for unrighteous -- that he might lead us to God, having been put to death indeed, in the flesh, and having been made alive in the spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>in which also to the spirits in prison having gone he did preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who sometime disbelieved, when once the long-suffering of God did wait, in days of Noah -- an ark being preparing -- in which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>also to which an antitype does now save us -- baptism, (not a putting away of the filth of flesh, but the question of a good conscience in regard to God,) through the rising again of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who is at the right hand of God, having gone on to heaven -- messengers, and authorities, and powers, having been subjected to him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Christ, then, having suffered for us in the flesh, you also with the same mind arm yourselves, because he who did suffer in the flesh has done with sin,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>for sufficient to us is the past time of life the will of the nations to have wrought, having walked in lasciviousnesses, desires, excesses of wines, revellings, drinking-bouts, and unlawful idolatries,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>in which they think it strange -- your not running with them to the same excess of dissoluteness, speaking evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>who shall give an account to Him who is ready to judge living and dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>for this also to dead men was good news proclaimed, that they may be judged, indeed, according to men in the flesh, and may live according to God in the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>And of all things the end has come near; be sober-minded, then, and watch unto the prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>and, before all things, to one another having the earnest love, because the love shall cover a multitude of sins;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, think it not strange at the fiery suffering among you that is coming to try you, as if a strange thing were happening to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but, according as you have fellowship with the sufferings of the Christ, rejoice you, that also in the revelation of his glory you may rejoice -- exulting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>if you be reproached in the name of Christ -- happy are you, because the Spirit of glory and of God upon you does rest; in regard, indeed, to them, he is evil-spoken of, and in regard to you, he is glorified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>for let none of you suffer as a murderer, or thief, or evil-doer, or as an inspector into other men's matters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>and if as a Christian, let him not be ashamed; and let him glorify God in this respect;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>because it is the time of the beginning of the judgment from the house of God, and if first from us, what the end of those disobedient to the good news of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And if the righteous man is scarcely saved, the ungodly and sinner -- where shall he appear?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>through which the then world, by water having been deluged, was destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>and the present heavens and the earth, by the same word are treasured, for fire being kept to a day of judgment and destruction of the impious men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>And this one thing let not be unobserved by you, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>the Lord is not slow in regard to the promise, as certain count slowness, but is long-suffering to us, not counselling any to be lost but all to pass on to reformation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>and it will come -- the day of the Lord -- as a thief in the night, in which the heavens with a rushing noise will pass away, and the elements with burning heat be dissolved, and earth and the works in it shall be burnt up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>All these, then, being dissolved, what kind of persons does it behoove you to be in holy behaviors and pious acts?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>and the long-suffering of our Lord count you salvation, according as also our beloved brother Paul -- according to the wisdom given to him -- did write to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as also in all the epistles, speaking in them concerning these things, among which things are certain hard to be understood, which the untaught and unstable do wrest, as also the other Writings, unto their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>You, then, beloved, knowing before, take heed, lest, together with the error of the impious being led away, you may fall from your own stedfastness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>and increase you in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ; to him is the glory both now, and to the day of the age! Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='3John.1.1'>The Elder to Gaius the beloved, whom I love in truth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.2'>beloved, concerning all things I desire you to prosper, and to be in health, even as your soul does prosper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.3'>for I rejoiced exceedingly, brethren coming and testifying of the truth in you, even as you in truth do walk;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.4'>greater than these things I have no joy, that I may hear of my children in truth walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.5'>Beloved, faithfully do you do whatever you may work to the brethren and to the strangers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.6'>who did testify of your love before an assembly, whom you will do well, having sent forward worthily of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.7'>because for His name they went forth, nothing receiving from the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.8'>we, then, ought to receive such, that fellow-workers we may become to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.9'>I did write to the assembly, but he who is loving the first place among them -- Diotrephes -- does not receive us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.10'>because of this, if I may come, I will cause him to remember his works that he does, with evil words prating against us; and not content with these, neither does he himself receive the brethren, and those intending he does forbid, and out of the assembly he does cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.11'>Beloved, be not you following that which is evil, but that which is good; he who is doing good, of God he is, and he who is doing evil has not seen God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.12'>to Demetrius testimony has been given by all, and by the truth itself, and we also -- we do testify, and you have known that our testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.13'>Many things I had to write, but I do not wish through ink and pen to write to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='3John.1.14'>and I hope straightway to see you, and mouth to mouth we shall speak. Peace to you! salute you do the friends; be saluting the friends by name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jude.1.2'>kindness to you, and peace, and love, be multiplied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.3'>Beloved, all diligence using to write to you concerning the common salvation, I had necessity to write to you, exhorting to agonize for the faith once delivered to the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.4'>for there did come in unobserved certain men, long ago having been written beforehand to this judgment, impious, the grace of our God perverting to lasciviousness, and our only Master, God, and Lord -- Jesus Christ -- denying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.5'>and to remind you I intend, you knowing once this, that the Lord, a people out of the land of Egypt having saved, again those who did not believe did destroy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.6'>messengers also, those who did not keep their own principality, but did leave their proper dwelling, to a judgment of a great day, in bonds everlasting, under darkness He has kept,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.7'>as Sodom and Gomorrah, and the cities around them, in like manner to these, having given themselves to whoredom, and gone after other flesh, have been set before -- an example, of fire age-during, justice suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.8'>In like manner, nevertheless, those dreaming also the flesh indeed do defile, and lordship they put away, and dignities they speak evil of,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.9'>yet Michael, the chief messenger, when, with the devil contending, he was disputing about the body of Moses, did not dare to bring up an evil-speaking judgment, but said, 'The Lord rebuke you!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.10'>and these, as many things indeed as they have not known, they speak evil of; and as many things as naturally (as the irrational beasts) they understand, in these they are corrupted;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.11'>woe to them! because in the way of Cain they did go on, and to the deceit of Balaam for reward they did rush, and in the gainsaying of Korah they did perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.12'>These are in your love-feasts craggy rocks; feasting together with you, without fear shepherding themselves; clouds without water, by winds carried about; trees autumnal, without fruit, twice dead, rooted up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.13'>wild waves of a sea, foaming out their own shames; stars going astray, to whom the gloom of the darkness to the age hath been kept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.14'>And prophesy also to these did the seventh from Adam -- Enoch -- saying, 'Lo, the Lord did come in His saintly myriads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.15'>to do judgment against all, and to convict all their impious ones, concerning all their works of impiety that they did impiously, and concerning all the stiff things that speak against Him did impious sinners.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.16'>These are murmurers, repiners; according to their desires walking, and their mouth does speak great swellings, giving admiration to persons for the sake of profit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.17'>and you, beloved, remember you the sayings spoken before by the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.18'>that they said to you, that in the last time there shall be scoffers, after their own desires of impieties going on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.19'>these are those setting themselves apart, natural men, the Spirit not having.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.20'>And you, beloved, on your most holy faith building yourselves up, in the Holy Spirit praying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.21'>yourselves in the love of God keep you, waiting for the kindness of our Lord Jesus Christ -- to life age-during;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.22'>and to some be kind, judging thoroughly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.23'>and some in fear save you, out of the fire snatching, hating even the coat from the flesh spotted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.24'>And to Him who is able to guard you not stumbling, and to set you in the presence of His glory unblemished, in gladness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jude.1.25'>to the only wise God our Saviour, is glory and greatness, power and authority, both now and to all the ages! Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>and I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, 'A measure of wheat for a denary, and three measures of barley for a denary,' and 'The oil and the wine you may not injure.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those slain because of the word of God, and because of the testimony that they held,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>and he did open the pit of the abyss, and there came up a smoke out of the pit as smoke of a great furnace, and darkened was the sun and the air, from the smoke of the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>And out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth, and there was given to them authority, as scorpions of the earth have authority,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>and it was said to them that they may not injure the grass of the earth, nor any green thing, nor any tree, but -- the men only who have not the seal of God upon their foreheads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>and it was given to them that they may not kill them, but that they may be tormented five months, and their torment is as the torment of a scorpion, when it may strike a man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>and in those days shall men seek the death, and they shall not find it, and they shall desire to die, and the death shall flee from them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>and they had breastplates as breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings is as the noise of chariots of many horses running to battle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>and they have tails like to scorpions, and stings were in their tails; and their authority is to injure men five months;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>and they have over them a king -- the messenger of the abyss -- a name is to him in Hebrew, Abaddon, and in the Greek he has a name, Apollyon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.20.6'>Happy and holy is he who is having part in the first rising again; over these the second death has not authority, but they shall be priests of God and of the Christ, and shall reign with him a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.7'>And when the thousand years may be finished, the Adversary shall be loosed out of his prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.8'>and he shall go forth to lead the nations astray, that are in the four corners of the earth -- Gog and Magog -- to gather them together to war, of whom the number is as the sand of the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.9'>and they did go up over the breadth of the land, and did surround the camp of the saints, and the beloved city, and there came down fire from God out of the heaven, and devoured them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>and the Devil, who is leading them astray, was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where are the beast and the false prophet, and they shall be tormented day and night -- to the ages of the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.11'>And I saw a great white throne, and Him who is sitting upon it, from whose face the earth and the heaven did flee away, and place was not found for them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.12'>and I saw the dead, small and great, standing before God, and scrolls were opened, and another scroll was opened, which is that of the life, and the dead were judged out of the things written in the scrolls -- according to their works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.13'>and the sea did give up those dead in it, and the death and the hades did give up the dead in them, and they were judged, each one according to their works;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.14'>and the death and the hades were cast to the lake of the fire -- this is the second death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.15'>and if any one was not found written in the scroll of the life, he was cast to the lake of the fire.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.21'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.1'>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth did pass away, and the sea is not any more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.2'>and I, John, saw the holy city -- new Jerusalem -- coming down from God out of the heaven, made ready as a bride adorned for her husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.3'>and I heard a great voice out of the heaven, saying, 'Lo, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He will tabernacle with them, and they shall be His peoples, and God Himself shall be with them -- their God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.4'>and God shall wipe away every tear from their eyes, and the death shall not be any more, nor sorrow, nor crying, nor shall there be any more pain, because the first things did go away.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.5'>And He who is sitting upon the throne said, 'Lo, new I make all things; and He said to me, 'Write, because these words are true and stedfast;'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.6'>and He said to me, 'It has been done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End; I, to him who is thirsting, will give of the fountain of the water of the life freely;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.7'>he who is overcoming shall inherit all things, and I will be to him -- a God, and he shall be to me -- the son,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.9'>And there came unto me one of the seven messengers, who have the seven vials that are full of the seven last plagues, and he spake with me, saying, 'Come, I will show you the bride of the Lamb -- the wife,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.10'>and he carried me away in the Spirit to a mountain great and high, and did show to me the great city, the holy Jerusalem, coming down out of the heaven from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.11'>having the glory of God, and her light is like a stone most precious, as a jasper stone clear as crystal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.12'>having also a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve messengers, and names written thereon, which are those of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.13'>at the east three gates, at the north three gates, at the south three gates, at the west three gates;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.14'>and the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.15'>And he who is speaking with me had a golden reed, that he may measure the city, and its gates, and its wall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.16'>and the city lies square, and the length of it is as great as the breadth; and he did measure the city with the reed -- furlongs twelve thousand; the length, and the breadth, and the height, of it are equal;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.17'>and he measured its wall, an hundred forty-four cubits, the measure of a man, that is, of the messenger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.18'>and the building of its wall was jasper, and the city is pure gold -- like to pure glass;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.19'>and the foundations of the wall of the city with every precious stone have been adorned; the first foundation jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, chalcedony; the fourth, emerald;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.20'>the fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh, chrysolite; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, topaz; the tenth, chrysoprasus; the eleventh, jacinth; the twelfth, amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>And the twelve gates are twelve pearls, each several one of the gates was of one pearl; and the broad-place of the city is pure gold -- as transparent glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>And a sanctuary I did not see in it, for the Lord God, the Almighty, is its sanctuary, and the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>and the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they may shine in it; for the glory of God did lighten it, and the lamp of it is the Lamb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'>and the nations of the saved in its light shall walk, and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honour into it,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.26'>and they shall bring the glory and the honour of the nations into it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.27'>and there may not at all enter into it any thing defiling and doing abomination, and a lie, but -- those written in the scroll of the life of the Lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, going forth out of the throne of God and of the Lamb:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>in the midst of its broad place, and of the river on this side and on that, is a tree of life, yielding twelve fruits, in each several month rendering its fruits, and the leaves of the tree are for the service of the nations;</verse>
