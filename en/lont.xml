        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The History of Jesus Christ, Son of David, Son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac begot Jacob. Jacob begot Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Judah had Pharez and Zarah by Tamar. Pharez begot Ezrom. Ezrom begot Aram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Aram begot Aminidab. Aminidab begot Nashon. Nashon begot Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon had Boaz by Rahab. Boaz had Obed by Ruth. Obed begot Jesse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>Jesse begot David the king. David the king had Solomon, by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon begot Rehoboam. Rehoboam begot Abia. Abia begot Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa begot Jehoshaphat. Jehoshaphat begot Joram. Joram begot Uzziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah begot Jotham. Jotham begot Ahaz. Ahaz begot Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Hezekiah begot Manasseh. Manasseh begot Amon. Amon begot Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah had Jeconiah and his brothers, about the time of the migration into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>After the migration into Babylon, Jeconiah begot Salathiel. Salathiel begot Zerubbabel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel begot Abiud. Abiud begot Eliakim. Eliakim begot Azor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor begot Zadoc. Zadoc begot Achim. Achim begot Eliud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud begot Eleazar. Eleazar begot Matthan. Matthan begot Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jacob begot Joseph, the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen; from David till the migration into Babylon, fourteen; from David till the migration into Babylon to the Messiah, fourteen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened thus: Mary his mother had been espoused to Joseph; but before they came together, she proved to be with child by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Joseph her husband being a virtuous man, and unwilling to expose her, intended to divorce her privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he was thinking upon this, an angel of the Lord appearing to him in a dream, said, Joseph, son of David, scruple not to take home Mary your wife; for her pregnancy is from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bear a son, whom you shall call Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>In all this what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet was verified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>«Behold the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, who shall be called Immanuel;» 'which signifies, God with us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>When Joseph awoke, he did as the messenger of the Lord had commanded him, and took home his wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>but knew her not, until she had brought forth her first born son, whom he named Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>After the birth of Jesus, at Bethlehem of Judea, in the reign of King Herod, certain eastern magicians came to Jerusalem, and inquired,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Where is the new-born King of the Jews; for we have seen his star in the east country, and are coming to do him homage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>King Herod hearing this, was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And having assembled all the chief priests and the scribes of the people, he demanded of them where the Messiah should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They answered, at Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the Prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>«And thou Bethlehem, in the canton of Judah, are not the least illustrious among the cities of Judah; for out of thee shall come a ruler, who will govern my people Israel.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod having secretly called the magicians, procured from them exact information concerning the time of the star's appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And sending them to Bethlehem, he said, Go, make an exact inquiry about the child; and when you have found him bring me word, that I may go also, and pay him homage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>Having heard the King, they departed; and lo! the star which had appeared to them in the east country, moved before them, till it came, and stood over the place, where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they again saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And being come into the house, they found the child with Mary his mother; and, prostrating themselves, did him homage. Then opening their caskets, they offered, as presents to him, gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went home another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>When they were gone, lo! a messenger of the Lord appearing to Joseph in a dream, said, Arise, take the child with his mother, and flee into Egypt; and remain there till I order you; for Herod will seek the child to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Accordingly he arose, took the child with his mother, and withdrew by night into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>«where he continued until the death of Herod; so that, what the Lord had spoken by the Prophet, was verified,» 'Out of Egypt I called my Son.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, finding that he had been deceived by the magicians, was highly incensed and dispatched emissaries who slew, by his order, all the male children in Bethlehem, and in all its territory, from those entering the second year, down to the time of which he had procured exact information from the magicians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was the word of Jeremiah the Prophet verified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>«A cry was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and weeping, and bitter complaint: Rachel bewailing her children, and refusing to be comforted, because they are no more.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>When Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord appearing in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Arise, take the child with his mother, and go into the land of Israel; for they are dead who sought his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Accordingly, he arose, took the child with his mother, and came to the land of Israel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>but hearing that Archelaus had succeeded his father Herod in the throne of Judea, he was afraid to return thither; and being warned in a dream, retired into the district of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and resided in a city named Nazareth; in this verifying the declarations of the Prophet concerning Jesus, that he should be called a Nazarene.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days appeared John the Immerser, who proclaimed in the wilderness of Judea, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>Reform, for the Reign of Heaven approaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>«For this is he, of whom the Prophet Isaiah speaks in these words,» 'The voice of one proclaiming in the wilderness, Prepare a way for the Lord, make for him a straight passage.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John wore raiment of camel's hair with a letter girdle about his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the country along the Jordan, resorted to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were immersed by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But he seeing many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to him to receive immersion, said to them, Offspring of vipers, who has prompted you to flee from the impending vengeance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Produce, then, the proper fruit of reformation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and presume not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father, for I assure you, that of these stones God can raise children to Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>And even now the ax lies at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, which produces not good fruit, is cut down, and turned into fuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I, indeed, immerse you in water, into reformation; but he who comes after me, is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy to carry. He will immerse you in the Holy Spirit, and in fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse his grain; he will gather his wheat into the granary, and consume the chaff in unquenchable fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then came Jesus from Galilee to the Jordan, to be immersed by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John excused himself, saying, It is I who need to be immersed by you; and you come to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>Jesus answering, said to him, Permit this at present; for thus ought we to ratify every institution. Then John acquiesced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>Jesus being immersed, no sooner arose out of the water, than heaven was opened to him; and the Spirit of God appeared, descending like a dove, and lighting upon him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>while a voice from heaven proclaimed, This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then was Jesus conducted by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>Then the tempter accosting him, said, If thou be God's Son, command that these stones become loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>«Jesus answering, said, It is written,'Man lives not by bread only, but by everything which God is pleased to appoint.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil conveyed him into the holy city, and having placed him on the battlement of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>«said to him, If thou be God's Son, throw thyself down; for it is written,» 'He will give his angels the charge of thee: they shall uphold thee in their arms, lest thou dash thy foot against a stone.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>«Jesus again answered, It is written,'Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the devil took him up a very high mountain, whence he showed him all the kingdoms of the world in their glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, All these will I give thee, if thou wilt prostrate thyself, and worship me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>«Jesus answered, Satan, begone; for it is written,'Thou shalt worship the Lord they God, and shall serve him only.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil leaving him, angels came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now Jesus, hearing that John was imprisoned, retired into Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>and having left Nazareth, resided at Capernaum, a seaport in the confines of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>thereby verifying the words of Isaiah the Prophet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>«The canton of Zebulun and the canton of Naphtali, situate on the Jordan near the sea, Galilee of the nations;»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who abode in darkness, saw a great light, and on those who inhabited a region of the shades of death, light has arisen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to proclaim, saying, Reform, for the Reign of Heaven approaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Then walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon named Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a drag into the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he said to them, Come with me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>Immediately they left the nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Passing on he saw other two brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the bark with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>They immediately, leaving the bark and their father, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Then Jesus went over all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad tidings of the Reign, and curing every sort of disease and malady among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame spread through all Syria, and they brought him all their sick, seized and tormented with various distempers, demoniacs, and lunatics, and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And vast multitudes followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the banks of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Jesus, seeing so great a confluence, repaired to a mountain, and having sat down, his disciples came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>Then breaking silence, he taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Happy the poor who repine not; for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Happy they who mourn; for they shall receive consolation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Happy the meek; for they shall inherit the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Happy they who hunger and thirst for righteousness; for they shall be satisfied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Happy the merciful; for they shall obtain mercy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Happy the pure in heart; for they shall see God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Happy the peace-makers; for they shall be called sons of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Happy they who suffer persecution on account of righteousness; for the kingdom of heaven is theirs!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Happy shall you be, when men shall revile and persecute you; and, on my account, accuse you falsely of every evil thing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and exult, for great is your reward in heaven; for thus the Prophets were persecuted, who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth. If the salt become insipid, how shall its saltness be restored? It is thenceforth fit only to be cast out, and trod under foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city situate on a mountain must be conspicuous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>A lamp is lighted to be put, not under a vessel, but on a stand, that it may shine to all the family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Thus, let your light shine before men, that they, seeing your good actions, may glorify your Father, who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I am come to subvert the law or the prophets. I am come not to subvert, but to ratify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For, indeed, I say to you, heaven and earth shall sooner perish, than one iota, or on tittle of the law shall perish, without attaining its end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whosoever, therefore, shall violate, or teach others to violate, were it the least of these commandments, shall be in no esteem in the Reign of Heaven; but whosoever shall practice and teach them, shall be highly esteemed in the Reign of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I tell you, that unless your righteousness excel the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, you shall never enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>«You have heard that it was said to the ancients,'You shall not commit murder; for whosoever commits murder shall be obnoxious to the judges.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you, whosoever is angry with his brother unjustly, shall be obnoxious to the judges; whosoever shall call him fool, shall be obnoxious to the council; but whosoever shall call him miscreant, shall be obnoxious to hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar, and there recollect, that your brother has ground to complain of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there your gift before the altar: first go and procure reconciliation with your brother; then come, and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Compound speedily with your creditor, while you are on the road together; lest he deliver you to the judge; and the judge consign you to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Indeed, I say to you, you will not be released, until you have discharged the last farthing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>«You have heard that it was said,'You shall not commit adultery.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, whoever looks on another man's wife, in order to cherish impure desire, has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>Therefore, if your right eye ensnare you, pluck it out, and throw it away: it is better for you to lose one of your members, than that your whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand ensnare you, cut it off and throw it away: it is better for you to lose one of your members, than that your whole body be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>«It has been said,'Whosoever would dismiss his wife, let him give her a writ of divorce.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you, whosoever shall dismiss his wife, except for whoredom, is the occasion of her becoming an adulteress; and whosoever marries her that is dismissed, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>«Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients,'You shall not forswear yourself, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, swear not at all; neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for it is his footstool; neither shall you swear by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>not by your head, because you can not make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your yes, be Yes; your no, No; for whatever exceeds these, proceeds from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>«You have heard that it was said,'Eye for eye, and tooth for tooth.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you, contend not with the injurious. But if any one strike you on the right cheek, turn to him also the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>Whoever will sue you for your coat, let him have your mantle likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And if a man constrain you to go one mile with him, go two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him that asks you; and him that would borrow from you, put not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>«You have heard that it was said,'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, love your enemies; bless them who curse you; do good to them who hate you; and pray for them who arraign and persecute you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>that you may be children of your Father in heaven, who makes his sun arise on bad and good, and sends rain on just and unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love them only who love you, what reward can you expect? Do not even the publicans so?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you salute your brothers only, wherein do you excel? Do not even the Pagans as much?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Be you therefore perfect, as your father who is in heaven is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>Take heed that you perform not your religious duties before men, in order to be observed by them; otherwise you will obtain no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>When, therefore, you give alms, do not proclaim it by sound of trumpet, as the hypocrites do, in the assemblies and in the streets, that they may be extolled by men. Indeed, I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But you, when you give alms, let not your left hand know what your right hand does;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>that your alms may be in secret; and your Father, to whom nothing is secret, will himself recompense you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when you pray, be not like the hypocrites, who affect to pray standing in the assemblies, and at the corners of the streets, that men may observe them. Indeed, I say to you, they have received their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But you, when you would pray, retire to your closet; and having shut the door, pray to your Father; and your Father, to whom, though he is unseen himself, nothing is secret, will recompense you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And in prayer, use not a multiplicity of words as the Pagans do, who think that using many words will gain them acceptance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Imitate them not; for your Father knows what things you want, before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Thus, therefore, pray you: Our Father, who art in heaven, thy name be hallowed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>thy Reign come; thy will be done upon earth, as it is in heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>give us today our daily bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>and lead us not into temptation, but preserve us from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>but if you forgive not others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>Moreover, when you fast, look not dismal, as the hypocrites, who disfigure their faces, that men may observe that they fast. Indeed, I say to you, they have their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But you, when you fast, anoint your head, and wash your face;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>that your fasting may not appear to men, but to your Father; and your Father, to whom, though he is unseen himself, nothing is secret, will recompense you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>Amass not for yourselves treasure upon the earth, where moths and rust may consume it, or thieves breaking in may steal it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>But provide for yourselves treasure in heaven, where are neither moths nor rust to consume it, nor thieves to break in and steal it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where your treasure is, your heart will also be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The eye is the lamp of the body. If, therefore, your eye be sound, your whole body will be enlightened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>but if your eye be distempered, your whole body will be dark. And if even the light which is in you be darkness, how great will the darkness be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>A man can not serve two masters; for either he will hate one, and love the other; or at least he will attend to one, and neglect the other. You cannot serve God and Mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>Therefore I charge you, be not anxious about your life, what you shall eat, or what you shall drink; nor about your body, what you shall wear. Is not life a greater gift than food; and the body more than raiment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Observe the fowls of heaven. They neither sow nor reap. They have no storehouse; but your heavenly Father feeds them. Are not you much more valuable than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>Besides, which of you can, by his anxiety, prolong his life one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are you anxious about raiment? Mark the lilies of the field. How do they grow? They toil not: they spin not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>Yet I affirm that even Solomon in all his glory, was not equally adorned with one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>If, then, God so array the herbage, which today is in the field, and to-morrow will be cast into the oven, will he not much more array you, O you distrustful!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore say not anxiously, (as the heathens do,) What shall we eat; or what shall we drink; or with what shall we be clothed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first the kingdom of God and the righteousness required by him; and all these things shall be superadded to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Be not then anxious about the morrow: the morrow will be anxious about itself. Sufficient for every day is its own trouble.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>Being come down from the mountain, followed by a great multitude,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>a leper came, who, presenting himself before him, said, Sir, if you will, you can cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>Jesus stretched out his hand, and touched him, saying, I will; be you clean. Immediately he was cured of his leprosy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>Then Jesus said to him, See you tell no person; but go, show yourself to the priest, and make the oblation prescribed by Moses, for notifying the cure to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>Having entered Capernaum, a centurion accosted him with this request,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>Sir, my man-servant lies sick at home, exceedingly afflicted with a palsy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>Jesus answered, I will go and cure him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion replying, said, Sir, I am not worthy, that you should come under my roof; only say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For even I, who am under command myself, having soldiers under me, say to one, Go, and he goes; to another, Come, and he comes; and to my servant, Do this, and he does it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>Jesus hearing this, was astonished, and said to those who followed, Indeed, I say to you, not even in Israel have I found so great faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>But I assure you, that many will come from the east and from the west, and will be placed at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, in the kingdom of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>while the sons of the kingdom shall be thrust out into outer darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Then Jesus said to the centurion, Go home; be it to you, according to your faith. That instant his servant was cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>Then Jesus having entered Peter's house, saw his wife's mother lying sick of a fever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>and having touched her hand, the fever left her; on which she arose and entertained him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>In the evening they presented to him many demoniacs; and he expelled the spirits with a word, and cured all the sick;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>«thus verifying the saying of the Prophet Isaiah,» 'He has himself carried off our infirmities, and borne our distresses.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Jesus seeing himself crowded on all sides, gave orders to pass to the opposite shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>Meantime, a scribe accosted him, saying, Rabbi, I will follow you whithersoever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>Jesus answered, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have places of shelter, but the Son of Man has not where to repose his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>Another, one of his disciples, said to him, Master, permit me to go first, and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>Jesus answered, Follow me, and let the dead bury their dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>Then entering the bark, his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>Soon after there arose in the sea so great a tempest, that the bark was covered with billows. But he being asleep,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>the disciples came and waked him, saying, Save us, Master, we perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>He answered, Why are you so timorous, O you distrustful? Then he arose, and having commanded the winds and the sea, a great calm ensued;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>insomuch that every one exclaimed with admiration, What personage is this, whom even the winds and the sea obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>When he was come to the other side, into the country of the Gadarenes, there met him two demoniacs, issuing out of the monuments, so furious, that no person durst pass that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>These instantly cried, saying, What hast thou to do with us, Son of God? Art thou come hither to torment us before the time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now there was feeding, at some distance, a great herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>And the friends besought him, saying, If thou expel us, permit us to go into the herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>He answered, Go. And when they were cast out, they went into the swine; on which the whole herd rushed down a precipice into the sea, and perished in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>Then the herdsmen fled into the city, and reported everything, and what had happened to the demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>Presently the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and having seen him, entreated him to depart out of their territory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>Then having gone aboard the bark, he repassed, and went to his own city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>where they brought to him a paralytic, laid upon a bed. Jesus perceiving their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, take courage, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>On which some of the scribes said within themselves, This man blasphemes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jesus knowing their sentiments, said, Why do you harbor evil thoughts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>Which is easier-to say, Your sins are forgiven; or to say, with effect -Arise and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon the earth to forgive sins; Arise, then, (said he to the paralytic,) take up your bed and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>Accordingly he arose, and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>And the people saw and wondered, glorifying God, who had given such power to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>As Jesus departed thence, he saw a man, named Matthew, sitting at the toll office; to whom he said, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>Afterward Jesus being at table in a house, many publicans and sinners came, and placed themselves with him and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>Some of the Pharisees observing this, said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>Jesus hearing them, answered, The whole need not a physician, but the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>«Go, therefore, and learn what this means,» 'I desire humanity, and not sacrifice:' 'for I came to call, not the righteous, but sinners.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then John's disciples addressing him, said, We and the Pharisees often fast: why do your disciples never fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>Jesus answered, Can the bridesmen mourn while the bridegroom is with them? But the time will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No person mends an old garment with undressed cloth; else the patch itself tears the garment, and makes a greater rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Neither do people put new wine into old leather bottles; otherwise the bottles burst: and thus, both the wine is spilt, and the bottles are rendered useless. But they put new wine into new bottles, and bother are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While he was speaking, a ruler came, and prostrating himself, said, My daughter is by this time dead; but come, and lay your hand upon her, and she will revive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>And Jesus arose, and, as he followed him, with his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>a woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with a bloody issue, coming behind, touched the tuft of his mantle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>for she said within herself, If I but touch his mantle, I shall recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>Jesus turning about, saw her, and said, Daughter, take courage, your faith has cured you. And the woman was well from that instant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>Being come into the ruler's house, and seeing the players on the flute, with the crowd, making a bustle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>he said to them, Withdraw, for the young woman is not dead, but asleep. And they derided him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>but when the people were put out, he entered, and having taken her by the hand, the young woman arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>Now the fame of this action spread through all the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>When Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him, crying, Son of David, have pity upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>Being come into the house, the blind men approached him: and Jesus said to them, Do you believe I can do this? They answered, Yes, Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then he touched their eyes, saying, Be it to you according to your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>Immediately their eyes were opened. And Jesus strictly charging them, said, Take care that no person know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But being departed, they spread his fame through all that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>They were scarcely gone, when a dumb demoniac was presented to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>The demon being expelled, the dumb spoke, and the people wondered, saying, Nothing like this was ever seen in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, He expels the demons by the prince of the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>Then Jesus went through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the glad tidings of the Reign, and curing every disease and every malady.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>But when he saw the multitudes, he had compassion upon them, because they were scattered and exposed, like a flock without a shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then he said to his disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the reapers are few:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>entreat, therefore, the Lord of the harvest, that he would send laborers to reap it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And having called to him his twelve disciples, he gave them power to expel unclean spirits, and to cure diseases and maladies of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.2'>Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: The first, Simon, called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James, son of Zebedee, and John his brother;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.11.1'>When Jesus had made an end of instructing his twelve disciples, he departed thence, to teach and give warning in the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.2'>Now John, having heard in prison of the works of the Messiah, sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.3'>who asked him, Are you he that comes, or must we expect another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.4'>Jesus answering, said to them, Go, and relate to John, what you have heard and seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.11.5'>The blind are made to see, the lame to walk; lepers are cleansed; the deaf hear; the dead are raised; and good news is brought to the poor;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.11.21'>Alas for thee, Chorazin! Alas for thee, Bethsaida! for if the miracles which have been performed in you, had been performed in Tyre and Sidon, they had reformed long ago in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.1'>At that time, as Jesus was walking through the corn on Sabbath, his disciples being hungry, began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.3'>He answered, Have you not read what David did, and his attendants, when they were hungry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.4'>how he entered the tabernacle of God, and eat the loaves of the presence, which was not lawful for him, or his attendants, to eat but solely for the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.5'>Or have you not learnt from the law, that the priests in the temple violate the rest to be observed on Sabbaths, and are blameless?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.9'>Leaving that place, he went into their synagogue,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.10'>and found a man there whose hand was blasted. They asked Jesus, with a design to accuse him, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.11'>He answered, What man is there amongst you, who having one sheep, if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath, will not lay hold on it, and lift it out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.12'>And does not a mean greatly excel a sheep? It is lawful, therefore, to do good on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.13'>Then he said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And as he stretched it out, it became sound like the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.14'>But the Pharisees went out, and concerted against Jesus to destroy him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.17'>Thus the word of the Prophet Isaiah was verified,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.38'>Then some of the Scribes and Pharisees interposed, saying, Rabbi, we desire to see a sign for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.39'>He answering, said to them, An evil and adulterous race demands a sign; but no sign shall be given it, but the sign of the Prophet Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.40'>For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the bosom of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.41'>The Ninevites will stand up in the judgment against this race, and cause it to be condemned, because they reformed when they were warned by Jonah; and behold here something greater than Jonah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.12.42'>The Queen of the South country will arise in the judgment against this race, and cause it to be condemned; because she came from the extremities of the earth to hear the wise discourses of Solomon; and behold here something greater than Solomon.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.12.45'>Then he goes, and brings with him seven other spirits more wicked than himself; and having entered, they dwell there; and the last state of that man is worse than the first: thus will it fare with this evil race.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.13'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.1'>The same day, Jesus having gone out of the house, sat by the sea-side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.2'>but so great a multitude flocked about him, that he went into a bark, and sat down there, while all the people stood on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.3'>Then he discoursed to them of many things in parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.4'>The sower, said he, went out to sow; and, in sowing, some seeds fell by the way-side, and the birds came and picked them up:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.5'>some fell on rocky ground, where they had but little earth: these sprang up the sooner, because the soil had no depth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.6'>but after the sun had beat upon them, they were scorched, and having no root, withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.7'>Some fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.8'>Others fell into good ground, and yielded increase, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.9'>Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.10'>Then the disciples addressed him, saying, Why do you speak to them in parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.11'>He answering, said to them, Because it is your privilege, and not theirs, to know the secrets of the Reign of Heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.12'>For to him that has, more shall be given, and he shall abound; but from him that has not, even that which he has shall be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.13'>For this reason I speak to them in parables; because they seeing, see not; and hearing, hear not, nor regard;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.14'>«insomuch that this prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled in them,» 'You will indeed hear, but will not understand; you will look, but will not perceive.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.15'>«For this people's understanding is stupefied, their ears are deafened, and their eyes they have closed; lest seeing with their eyes, hearing with their ears, and apprehending with their understanding, they should reform, and I should reclaim them.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.16'>But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.17'>For, indeed, I say to you, that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see the things which you see, but have not seen them; and to hear the things which you hear, but have not heard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.18'>Understand you, therefore, the parable of the sower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.19'>When one hears the doctrine of the Reign, but considers it not, the evil one comes, and snatches away that which was sown in his heart. This explains what fell by the way-side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.20'>That which fell on rocky ground, denotes him who, hearing the word, receives it at first with pleasure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.21'>yet, not having it rooted in his mind, retains it but a while; for when trouble or persecution comes, because of the word, instantly he relapses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.22'>That which fell among thorns, denotes that hearer in whom worldly cares, and deceitful riches, choke the word, and render it unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.23'>But that which fell into good soil, and bore fruit, some a hundred, some sixty, some thirty fold, denotes him, who not only hears and considers, but obeys the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.24'>Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a field, in which the proprietor has sown good grain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.25'>but while people were asleep, his enemy came, and sowed darnel among the wheat, and went off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.26'>When the blade was up, and putting forth the ear, then appeared also the darnel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.27'>And the servants came, and said to their master, Sir, you sowed good grain in your field; whence, then, has it darnel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.28'>He answered, An enemy has done this. They said, Will you, then, that we weed them out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.29'>He replied, No, lest in weeding out the darnel, you tear up the wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.30'>Let both grow together until the harvest; and in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, first gather the darnel, and make them into bundles for burning; then carry the wheat into my barn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.31'>Another similitude he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed, which a man planted in his field;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>for though it is the smallest of seeds, when grown, larger than any herb, and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air take the shelter in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Another similitude he gave them: The kingdom of heaven is like leaven, which a woman mingled in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>All these similitudes Jesus spoke to the people; for he taught them only by similitudes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>«in this verifying the word of the Prophet,» 'I will discourse in parables; I will utter things concerning which, all antiquity has been silent.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then Jesus, leaving the multitude, retired to the house, where his disciples accosted him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the darnel in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>Jesus answering, said to them, He who sowed the good seed is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>The field is the world; the good seed are the sons of the kingdom; and the darnel are the sons of the evil one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the conclusion of this state; and the reapers are the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>As, therefore, the darnel is gathered and burnt, so shall it be at the conclusion of this state.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of Man will send his angels who shall gather out of his kingdom all seducers and iniquitous persons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.42'>and throw them into the burning furnace: weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then shall the righteous shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. Whoever has ears to hear let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a field, which, when a man has discovered, he conceals the discovery, and for joy thereof, sells all that he has, and buys that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a pearl extremely precious, which a merchant, in quest of fine pearls,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.46'>having found, sold all that he had, and purchased it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.47'>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a sweep-net cast into the seam which encloses fish of every kind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.48'>When it is full, they draw it ashore, and gather the good into vessels, but throw the useless away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.49'>So it shall be at the conclusion of this state. The angels will come and separate the wicked from among the righteous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.50'>and throw them into the burning furnace. Weeping and gnashing of teeth shall be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.51'>Jesus said, Do you understand all these things? They answered, Yes, Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.52'>He added, Every scribe, therefore, instructed for the Reign of Heaven, is like a householder, who brings out of his storehouse new things and old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.53'>And after he had finished these similitudes, he departed thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.54'>Jesus being come into his own country, taught the inhabitants in their synagogue; and they said with astonishment, Whence has this man this wisdom, and this power of working miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.55'>Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And do not his brothers, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.56'>and all his sisters, live amongst us? Whence, then, has he all these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.57'>Thus they were offended at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is no where disregarded, except in his own country, and in his own family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.58'>And he did not many miracles there, because of their unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.14'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.1'>At that time, Herod the tetrarch, hearing of the fame of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.2'>said to his servants, This is John the Immerser; he is raised from the dead and therefore miracles are performed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For Herod had caused John to be apprehended, imprisoned, and bound, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.4'>for John had said to him, It is not lawful for you to have her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>And Herod would have put him to death, but was afraid of the populace, who accounted him a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company, and pleased Herod,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.11'>And his head was brought in a basin, and presented to the young woman; and she carried it to her mother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.13'>When Jesus heard this, he embarked privately; and retired into a desert place; of which the people being informed followed him by land out of the cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.14'>Observing, as he landed, a great multitude, he had compassion on them, and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.15'>Toward the evening, his disciples accosted him, saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past, dismiss the multitude, that they may go to the villages; and buy themselves provisions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.17'>They said to him, We have here but five loaves and two fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.18'>He replied, Bring them hither to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.19'>Then having commanded the people to recline upon the grass, he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking toward heaven, blessed them; then breaking the loaves, he gave them to the disciples, and they distributed them among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.20'>When all had eat, and were satisfied, they carried off twelve baskets full of the fragments that remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.21'>Now they that had eat were about five thousand men; besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>Immediately he obliged the disciples to embark and pass over before him, while he dismissed the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.23'>Having dismissed the multitude, he retired by himself to a mountain to pray, and remained there alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.24'>By that time the bark was half way over, tossed by the waves, for the wind was contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.25'>In the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, being terrified, they exclaimed, An apparition! and cried out for fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>Jesus immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I, be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.28'>Peter answering, said to him, If it be you, Master, bid me to come to you on the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.29'>Jesus said, Come. Then Peter getting out of the bark, walked on the water toward Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.30'>But finding the wind boisterous, he was frightened; and beginning to sink, cried, Master, save me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.31'>Jesus instantly stretching out his hand, caught him; and said to him, Distrustful man, wherefore did you doubt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>When they had gone aboard, the wind ceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then those in the bark came, and prostrated themselves before him, saying, You are assuredly God's son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>Having passed over, they landed on the territory of Gennesaret;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>the inhabitants of which knowing him, sent through all that country, and brought to him all the diseased,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.36'>who besought him to let them touch but a tuft of his mantle; and as man as touched were cured.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.15'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.1'>Then some Scribes and Pharisees of Jerusalem addressed him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.2'>Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders; for they was not their hands before meals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>Jesus answering, said to them, Why do you yourselves by your tradition, transgress the commandment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>«For God has commanded, saying,'Honor father and mother'; and'Whosoever reviles father or mother, let him be punished with death.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.5'>But you affirm, If a man say to father or mother, I devote whatever of mine shall profit you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.6'>he shall not afterward honor by his assistance, his father or his mother. Thus, by your tradition, you annul the commandment of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.7'>Hypocrites, well do you suit the character which Isaiah gave of you, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.8'>«This people honor me with their lips. though their heart is estranged from me.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.9'>«But in vain they worship me, while they teach institutions merely human.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.10'>Then, having called the multitude, he said to them, Hear, and be instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.11'>It is not what goes into the mouth pollutes the man; but it is what proceeds out of the mouth, that pollutes the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.12'>On which his disciples accosting him, said, Did you observe how the Pharisees, when they heard that saying were offended?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.13'>He answered, Every plant, which my heavenly Father has not planted, shall be extirpated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.14'>Let them alone. They are blind leaders of the blind; and if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into the ditch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.15'>Then Peter addressing him, said, Explain to us that parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.16'>Jesus answered, Are you also void of understanding?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.17'>Do you not apprehend, that whatever enters the mouth passes into the stomach, and is thrown out into the sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.18'>But that which proceeds out of the mouth, issues from the heart, and so pollutes the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.19'>For out of the heart proceed malicious contrivances, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false testimonies, calumnies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.20'>These are the things which pollute the man; but to eat with unwashed hands pollutes not the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.21'>Then Jesus withdrew into the confines of Tyre and Sidon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.22'>and behold! a Canaanitish woman of these territories came to him, crying, Master, Son of David, have pity on me; my daughter is grievously afflicted by a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.23'>But he gave her no answer. Then his disciples interposed, and entreated him, saying, Dismiss her, for she clamors after us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.24'>He answering said, My mission is only to the lost sheep of the stock of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.25'>She, nevertheless, advanced, and prostrating herself before him, said, O Lord, help me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>He replied, It is not seemly to take the children's bread, and throw it to the dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.27'>True, Sir, returned she. Yet even the dogs are allowed the crumbs which fall from their master's table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.28'>Then Jesus, answering, said to her, O woman! great is your faith. Be it to you as you desire. And that instant her daughter was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.29'>Jesus having left that place, came nigh to the sea of Galilee, and repaired to a mountain, where he sat down;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.30'>and great multitudes flocked to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the dumb, the cripple, and several others, whom they laid at his feet; and he healed them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.31'>insomuch that the people beheld, with admiration, the dumb speaking, the cripple sound, the lame walking, and the blind seeing; and they glorified the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.32'>Then Jesus called to him his disciples, and said, I have compassion on the multitude because they have now attended me three days, and have nothing to eat; I will not dismiss them fasting, lest they faint by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.33'>His disciples answered, Whence can we get bread enough, in the solitude, to satisfy such a crowd?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.34'>He asked them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven, and a few small fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.35'>Then commanding the people to recline upon the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.36'>he took the seven loaves and the fishes, which, having given thanks, he divided and gave to his disciples, who distributed them among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.37'>When all had eat, and were satisfied, they carried off seven hand-baskets full of the fragments that remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.38'>Now they that had eat were four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.39'>Then having dismissed the multitude, he embarked, and sailed to the coast of Magdala.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.16'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.1'>Thither some Pharisees and Sadducees repaired, who, to try him, desired that he would show them a sign in the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.2'>He answering, said to them, In the evening you say, it will be fair weather, for the sky is red:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.3'>and in the morning, There will be a storm today, for the sky is red and lowering. You can judge aright of the appearance of the sky, but can you not discern the signs of the times?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.4'>An evil and adulterous race demands a sign, but no sign shall be given it, except the sign of the Prophet Jonah. Then leaving them he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.5'>Now his disciples, before they came over, had forgot to bring loaves with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.6'>Jesus said to them, Take head, and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.7'>On which they said, reasoning among themselves, This is because we have brought no loaves with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>Jesus perceiving it, said, What do you reason amongst yourselves, O you distrustful! that I speak thus, because you have brought no loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Have you no reflection? or do you not remember the five loaves among the five thousand, and how many baskets you filled with the fragments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.10'>nor the seven loaves among the four thousand, and how many hand-baskets you filled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.11'>How is it, that you do not understand, that I spoke not concerning bread, when I bade you beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.12'>Then they understood, that he cautioned them not against the leaven which the Pharisees and the Sadducees used in bread, but against their doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.13'>As Jesus was going to the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that the Son of Man is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.14'>They answered, Some say, John the Immerser; others, Elijah; others, Jeremiah, or one of the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.15'>But who, returned he, do you say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.16'>Simon Peter answering, said, You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.17'>Jesus replying, said to him, Happy are you, Simon Barjona; for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.18'>I tell you, likewise, you are named Stone; and on this rock I will build my congregation, over which the gates of Hades shall not prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.19'>Moreover, I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven: whatever you shall bind on the earth, shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you shall loose on the earth, shall be loosed in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.20'>Then he forbade his disciples to tell any many that he is the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.21'>From that time Jesus began to disclose to his disciples, that he must go to Jerusalem, and there suffer much from the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and that he must be raised the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.22'>On which, Peter taking him aside, reproved him, saying, Be this far from you, Master; this shall not befall you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.23'>But he turning, said to Peter, Get you thence, adversary, you are an obstacle in my way; for you relish not the things of God, but the things of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.24'>Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any man will come under my guidance, let him renounce himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.25'>For, whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.26'>What is a man profited, if he should gain the whole world, with the forfeit of his life? or what will a man not give in ransom for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.27'>For the Son of Man, vested with his Father's glory, shall come hereafter with his heavenly messengers, and recompense every one according to his actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.28'>Indeed, I say to you, some of those who are present, shall not taste death, until they see the Son of Man enter upon his Reign.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.17'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.1'>After six days, Jesus took Peter, and James, and John, brother of James, apart to the top of a high mountain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.2'>and was transfigured in their presence, His face shone as the sun; and his raiment became white as the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.3'>And presently appeared to them Moses and Elijah conversing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.4'>Peter, upon this, addressing Jesus, said, Master, it is good for us to stay here; let us make here, if you will, three booths; one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.5'>While he was speaking, behold! a bright cloud covered them, and out of the cloud a voice came, which said, This is my Son, the beloved in whom I delight; hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.6'>The disciples, hearing this, fell upon their faces, and were greatly frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.7'>But Jesus came and touched them, saying, Arise; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.8'>Then lifting up their eyes, they saw none but Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.9'>As they went down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, Tell no person what you have seen, until the Son of Man rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.10'>Then the disciples asked him, saying, Why say the scribes that Elijah must come first?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.11'>Jesus answering, said to them, To consummate the whole, Elijah, indeed, must come first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.12'>But I tell you, Elijah is come already, though they did not acknowledge him, but have treated him as they pleased. Thus they will treat the Son of Man also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.13'>Then the disciple understood, that he spoke concerning John the Immerser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.14'>When they were come to the multitude, a man came to him, who kneeling, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.15'>Sir, have pity on my son; for he is grievously distressed with lunacy; often he falls into the fire, and often into the water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.16'>and I presented him to your disciples; but they could not cure him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.17'>Jesus answering, said, O unbelieving and perverse race! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bring him hither to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.18'>Then Jesus rebuked the demon, and he came out: and the lad was instantly cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.19'>At that time the disciple came to him privately, saying, Why could not we expel the demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.20'>Jesus answered, Because of your unbelief; for, indeed, I say to you, if you had faith, though but as a grain of mustard seed, you might say to this mountain, Remove to yonder place, and it would remove: yes, nothing would be impossible to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.21'>This kind, however, is not dispossessed, unless by prayer and fasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.22'>While they remained in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is to be delivered up to men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.23'>who will kill him: but the third day he shall be raised again. And they were grieved exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.24'>When they were come to Capernaum, the collectors came and asked Peter, Does not your teacher pay the didrachma?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.25'>He said, Yes. Being come into the house, before he spoke, Jesus said to him, What is your opinion, Simon? From whom do the kings of the earth exact tribute or custom? from their own sons, or from others?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.26'>Peter answered, From others. Jesus replied, The sons then are exempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.27'>Nevertheless, lest we shall give them offense, go to the sea and throw a line, draw out the first fish that is hooked, and, having opened its mouth, you shall find a stater; take that, and give it to them for me and you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.5'>Nay, whosoever receives one such child, in my name, receives me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.6'>but whosoever shall ensnare any of these little ones, who believe in me, it were better for him that an upper millstone were hanged about his neck, and that he were sunk in the ocean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.7'>Alas for the world because of snares! Snares indeed there must be; nevertheless, alas for the ensnarer!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.8'>Wherefore, if your hand or foot ensnare you, cut it off and throw it away; it is better for you to enter lame or maimed into life, than having two hands or feet to be cast into the everlasting fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.9'>And if your eye ensnare you, pluck it out and throw it away; it is better for you to enter one-eyed into life, than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.10'>Beware of contemning any of these little ones; for I assure you, that in heaven, their angels continually behold the face of my heavenly Father:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.15'>Wherefore, if your brother trespass against you, go and expostulate with him, when you and he are alone together. If he hear you, you have gained your brother;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>So his master, being provoked, delivered him to the jailors, to remain in their hands until he should clear the debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>Thus will my heavenly Father treat every one of you, who forgives not, from his heart, his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.19.8'>He answered, Moses, indeed, because of your intractable disposition, permitted you to divorce your wives, but it was not so from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.9'>Therefore, I say to you, whoever divorces his wife, except for whoredom, and marries another, commits adultery: and whoever marries the woman divorced, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.10'>His disciples said to him, If such be the condition of the husband, it is better to live unmarried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.11'>He answered, They alone are capable of living thus, on whom the power is conferred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.12'>For some are eunuchs from their birth; others have been made eunuchs by men; and others, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven, have made themselves eunuchs. Let him act this part who can act it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.13'>Then children were presented to him, that he might lay his hands on them, and pray, but the disciples reproved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.14'>Jesus said, Let the children alone, and hinder them not from coming to me; for of such is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.15'>And having laid his hands on them, he departed thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.16'>Afterward, one approaching, said to him, Good Teacher, what good must I do to obtain eternal life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.17'>He answered, Why do you call me good? God alone is good. If you would enter into that life, keep the commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.18'>«He said to him, Which? Jesus answered, » 'You shall not commit murder. You shall not commit adultery. You shall not steal. You shall not give false testimony.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.19'>«Honor father and mother; and love your neighbor as yourself.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.20'>The young man replied, All these I have observed from my childhood. In what am I still deficient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.21'>Jesus answered, If you would be perfect, go sell your estate, and give the price to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.22'>The young man hearing this, went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.23'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, Indeed, I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.24'>I say further, it is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.25'>The disciples, who heard this with amazement, said, Who then can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.26'>Jesus, looking at them, answered, With men this is impossible, but with God everything is possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.27'>Then Peter replying, said, As for us, we have forsaken all, and followed you; what then shall be our reward?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.28'>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that at the Renovation, when the Son of Man shall be seated on his glorious throne, you, my followers, sitting upon the twelve thrones, shall judge the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.29'>And whoever shall have forsaken, on my account, houses, or brothers, or sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands, shall receive a hundred fold, and inherit eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.30'>But many shall be first that are last, and last that are first.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>When they were nigh Jerusalem, being come to Bethphage, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>saying, Go to the village opposite to you, where you will find an ass tied, and her colt with her; loose them, and bring them hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>If any man say anything to you, say, Your Master wants them, and he will send them directly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>Now all this was done, that the words of the Prophet might be fulfilled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>«Say to the daughters of Zion, behold your King comes to you lowly, riding on an ass, even the colt of a laboring beast.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>Accordingly the disciples went, and having done as Jesus had commanded them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>brought the ass and the colt, and covering them with their mantles, made him ride.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>Now the greater part spread their mantles in the way; others lopped branches off the trees, and strowed them in the way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>while the crowd that went before and that followed, shouted, saying, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed be he that comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>When he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was in an uproar, everybody asking, Who is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>The crowd answered, It is Jesus, the prophet of Nazareth, in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>Then Jesus went into the temple of God, and drove thence all who sold and who brought in the temple, and overturned the tables of the money-changers, and the stalls of those who sold doves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>«and said to them, It is written,'My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>Then the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>But the chief priests and the scribes, seeing the wonders which he performed, and the boys crying in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>«said to him with indignation, Do you hear what these say? Jesus answered, Yes. Have you never read,'From the mouth of infants and sucklings thou hast procured praise?'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>And leaving them, he went out of the city of Bethany, where he remained that night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>Returning to the city in the morning, he was hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>and seeing a single fig tree by the road, he went to it; but finding only leaves on it, said, Let no fruit grow on you henceforward. And the fig tree withered forthwith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>When the disciples saw it, they said with astonishment, how soon is the fig tree withered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, if you have an unshaken faith, you may not only do as much as is done to the fig tree, but even if you should say to this mountain, Be lifted up, and thrown into the sea, it shall be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.22'>Whatsoever you shall ask in prayer, with faith, you shall receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>Being come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came near, as he was teaching, and said, by what authority do you these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>Jesus answering, said to them, I also have a question to propose, which if you answer me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>Whence had John authority to immerse? From heaven or from men? Then they reasoned thus within themselves: If we say, From heaven, he will retort, Why then did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.26'>And if we say, From men, we dread the multitude, amongst whom John is universally accounted a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>They, therefore, answered him, We can not tell. Jesus replied, Neither do I tell you, by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>But what do you think of this? A man had two sons, and addressing his elder son, said, Son, go work today in any vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>He answered, I will not, but afterward repented and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>Then addressing the younger, he bade him likewise. He answered, Immediately, Sir, but went not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>Now, which of the two obeyed his father? They said, The first. Jesus replied, Indeed, I say to you, even the publicans and harlots show you the way into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>For John came to you in the way of sanctity, and you believed him not; but the publicans and the harlots believed him: yet you who saw this, did not afterward repent and believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>Hear another parable: A landlord planted a vineyard, and hedged it round, and digged a wine press in it, and built a tower; and having farmed it out, went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.34'>When the vintage approached, he sent his servants to the husbandmen to receive the fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.35'>But they seized his servants, beat one, drove away with stones another, and killed another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.36'>Again he sent other servants more respectable; but they received the same treatment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>finally he sent his son to them: for he said, They will reverence my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, and keep possession of his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.39'>Then they seized him, thrust him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>When, therefore, the proprietor of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those husbandmen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They answered, He will put those wretched to a wretched death, and will let the vineyard to others, who will render him the fruits in the season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>«Jesus replied, Did you never read in the scriptures,'A stone which the builders rejected, is made the head of the corner? This the Lord has effected, and we behold it with admiration.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.43'>Know, therefore, that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you, and given to a nation who will produce the fruits of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.44'>For whosoever shall fall on this stone, shall be bruised; and on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.45'>The chief priests and the Pharisees hearing his parables, perceived that he spoke of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.46'>but though they wished to lay hold on him, they were afraid of the populace, who reckoned him a prophet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.22'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.1'>Jesus continuing to discourse to them in parables, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.2'>The Administration of Heaven resembles the conduct of a king, who having made a marriage feast for his son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.3'>sent his servants to call them, who had been invited; but they would not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>Then he sent other servants, saying, Tell those who are invited I have prepared my feast; my bullocks and fatlings are slain, and all is ready; come to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.5'>But they turned away with indifference, one to his farm, another to his merchandize.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>And the rest seizing his servants, abused and killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>When the king heard this, being enraged, he sent his soldiers, destroyed those murderers, and burnt their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>Then he said to his servants, The entertainment is ready; but they who were invited were not worthy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>go therefore, into the public roads, and all that you can find, invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>Accordingly they went into the highways, and assembled all that they found, good and bad, so that the hall was furnished with guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>When the king came in to see the guests, observing one who had not on a wedding garment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>he said to him, Friend, how came you here without a wedding garment? And he was speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>Then the king said to the attendants, Bind him hand and foot, and thrust him out into darkness, where will be weeping and gnashing of teeth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>for there are many called, but few chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then the Pharisees retired, and having consulted how they might entrap him in his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>sent to him some of their disciples, and some Herodians, who being instructed by them, said, Rabbi, we know that you are sincere, and faithfully teach the way of God, without partiality, for you respect not the person of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>Tell us, therefore, your opinion: Is it lawful to give tribute to Cesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.18'>Jesus, perceiving their malice, said, Dissemblers, why would you entangle me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.19'>Show me the tribute money. And they reached him a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>He asked them, Whose image and inscription is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.21'>They answered, Cesar's. He replied, Render, then, to Cesar that which is Cesar's, and to God that which is God's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>And admiring his answer, they left him, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>The same day Sadducees, who say that there is no future life, came to him and addressed him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>Rabbi, Moses has said, if one die, and have no children, his brother shall marry his widow, and raise issue to the deceased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>Now there lived among us seven brothers; the eldest married and died without issue, leaving his wife to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>Thus also the second, and the third, and so to the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>Now, at the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of the seven; for they all married her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>Jesus answering, said to them, You err, not knowing the scriptures, nor the power of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>for in that state, they neither marry, nor give in marriage: they resemble the angels of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>But as to the revival of the dead, have you not read what God declared to you, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>Now, the people who heard this, were struck with awe at his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>Meantime, the Pharisees hearing that he had silenced the Sadducees, flocked about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>Then, one of them, a lawyer, trying him, proposed this question,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>Rabbi, which is the greatest commandment in the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>«Jesus answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the first and greatest commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>«The second is like it,'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>On these two commandments the whole law and the prophets depend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>saying, What do you think of the Messiah? Who son should he be? They answered, David's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>He replied, How then does David, speaking by inspiration, call him his Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>«The Lord,» 'says he, '«said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I make your foes your footstool.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If the Messiah were David's son, would David call him his Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.46'>To this none of them could answer; and from that day no person presumed to interrogate him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.23'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.1'>Then Jesus addressed the people and his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.2'>saying, The Scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' chair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.3'>therefore observe and do whatsoever they enjoin you; nevertheless, follow not their example; for they say and do not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.4'>Heavy and intolerable burdens they prepare for other men's shoulders, burdens to which they themselves will not put a finger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.5'>But whatever they do they do to be observed by men. For this they wear broader phylacteries than others, and larger tufts on their mantles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.6'>and love the uppermost places at entertainments, and the principal seats in the synagogues,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.7'>and salutations in public places; and to hear men addressing them, cry, Rabbi, Rabbi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.8'>But as for you, assume not the title of Rabbi; for you have only one teacher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.9'>and style no man on earth your father, for he alone is your Father, who is in heaven; and all you are brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.10'>Neither assume the title of leaders, for you have only one leader-who is the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.11'>The greatest of you, on the contrary, shall be your servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.12'>for whosoever will exalt himself, shall be humbled; and whosoever will humble himself, shall be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.23.13'>But alas for you, Scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! because you shut the kingdom of heaven against men; and will neither enter yourselves, nor permit others that would, to enter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.24.6'>Nay, you shall hear of wars, and rumors of wars; but take care that you be not alarmed: for all these things must happen; but the end is not yet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.24.9'>For they will deliver you to torments and to death, and you shall be hated by all nations on my account.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>Jesus, having ended this discourse, said to his disciples,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>About this time the chief priests and scribes, and the elders of the people, were convened in the palace of Caiaphas the high priest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>where they consulted how they might take Jesus by surprise, and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>They said, however, not during the festival, lest there be a commotion among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now Jesus being in Bethany, in the house of Simon, formerly a leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came to him with an alabaster box of balsam, very precious, which she poured on his head while he was at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>His disciples observing it, said, with indignation, Why this profusion?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>This might have been sold for a great price, and the money given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>Jesus knowing it, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? She has done a good office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For you have the poor always amongst you, but me you have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For it is to embalm me, that she has poured this balsam upon my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Indeed, I say to you, in what part soever of the world the gospel shall be preached, what this woman has now done, shall be mentioned to her honor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of unleavened bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where shall we prepare for you the paschal supper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>He answered, Go into the city, to such a man, and tell him, The Teacher says, My time is near; I must celebrate the passover at your house with my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as they were ordered, and prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>In the evening he placed himself at table with the twelve;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>and while they were eating, he said, Indeed, I say to you, that one of you will deliver me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And they were extremely sorrowful, and began every one of them to say, Master, is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>He answering, said, The man, whose hand is in the dish with mine, is he who betrays me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man departs in the manner foretold in the scripture concerning him; but alas for that man, by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! it had been better for that man never to have been born.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter, then, said to him, Though you should prove a stumbling stone to them all, I never will be made to stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that this very night, before the cock crow, you will thrice disown me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter replied, Although I should die with you, I never will disown you. And all the disciples said the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to his disciples, Stay here, while I go yonder and pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And he took with him Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee; and being oppressed with grief,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>said to them, My soul is overwhelmed with a deadly anguish; abide here, and watch with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he returned to his disciples, and finding them asleep, said to Peter, Is it so, then, that you could not keep awake with me a single hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, that you be not overcome by temptation; the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>A second time he withdrew and prayed, saying, O my Father, if there be no exemption for me; if I must drink this cup, thy will be done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came back to his disciples, and said to them, Do you sleep now, and take your rest? Behold, the hour approaches, when the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise, let us be going; lo! he who betrays me is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>Before he was done speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, appeared with a great multitude, armed with swords and clubs, and sent by their chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, The man whom I shall kiss in he; secure him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus answered, Friend, for what purpose do you come? Then they advanced, and laying hands on Jesus, seized him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>Then turning to, the multitude, he said, Do you come with swords and clubs to apprehend me, like people in pursuit of a robber? I sat daily amongst you, teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened, that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him and fled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Meantime the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole Sanhedrin, sought out false evidence against Jesus, upon which they might condemn him to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>But though many false witnesses appeared, they found it not. At length two false witnesses came,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>Then the high priest rising, said to him, Do you answer nothing to what these men testify against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>Jesus remaining silent, he added, On the part of the living God, I adjure you to tell us, whether you be the Messiah, the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus answered him, It is as you say: nay, be assured, that hereafter you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest, rending his clothes, said, He has uttered blasphemy. What further need have we of witnesses, now that you have heard him blaspheme?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spit in his face. Some gave him blows on the head, and others struck him on the cheeks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>and said, Divine to us, Messiah, who it was the smote you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting without in the court, and a maid servant came to him, and said, You also were with Jesus, the Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before them all, saying, I know nothing of the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And as he went out into the porch, another maid observing him, said to them, This man too was there with Jesus the Nazarene.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now the centurion, and they who, with him, guarded Jesus, observing the earthquake, and what passed, were exceedingly terrified, and said, This was certainly the son of a god.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>When they were gone, Jesus himself met them, saying, Rejoice. Upon which they prostrated themselves before him, and embraced his feet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the country of Judea, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, resorted to him, and were immersed by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Now John's clothing was of camel's hair, tied around his waist with a leather girdle: and he lived upon locusts and wild honey.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>At that time Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee to the Jordan, and was immersed by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>As soon as he arose out of the water, he saw the sky part asunder, and the Spirit descend upon him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And a voice from heaven, which said, Thou art my Son, the beloved, in whom I delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>Immediately after this, the spirit conveyed him into the wilderness;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>Now there was in their synagogue a man possessed with an unclean spirit, who cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>Ah! Jesus of Nazareth, what hast thou to do with us? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art, the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>Jesus rebuking him, said, Be silent, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>Then the unclean spirit threw him into convulsions; and, raising loud cried, came out of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>at which they were all so amazed, that they asked one another, What does this mean? For he commands with authority even the unclean spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And thenceforth his fame spread through all the region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>As soon as they were come out of the synagogue, they went with James and John into the house of Simon and Andrew,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>where Simon's wife's mother lay sick of a fever, of which they immediately acquainted Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>Accordingly he proclaimed in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and expelled demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper came to him, and on his knees entreated him, saying, If you will, you can cleanse me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>This he had no sooner uttered, than the leprosy departed from the man, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>Then Jesus strictly charging him, and dismissing him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>said, See you tell nothing of this to any man; but go, show yourself to the priest; and offer for your cleansing the things prescribed by Moses, that it may be notified to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But the man, as soon as he was gone, began to blaze this story, talking openly everywhere, insomuch that Jesus could no longer publicly appear in the city; but remained without in solitary places, whither the people resorted to him from all parts.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>After many days, he returned to Capernaum; and when it was known that he was in the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>such a multitude flocked thither, that there was no room for them, not even near the door, and he taught them the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>A paralytic was then brought, carried by four men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>who, not being able to come nigh him for the crowd, uncovered the place where Jesus was; and, through the opening, let down the conch, on which the paralytic lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Jesus perceiving their faith, said to the paralytic, Son, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But certain scribes who were present, reasoned thus within themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>How does this man speak such blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Jesus, immediately knowing in himself that they made these reflections, said to them, Why do you reason thus within yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, with effect, Arise, take up your couch and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power upon the earth to forgive sins, rise, (he said to the paralytic,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>I command you, take up your couch, and go home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>Immediately he rose, took up the couch, and walked out before them all; insomuch that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Again, he went out toward the sea, and all the multitude repaired to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>Passing along, he saw Levi, son of Alpheus, sitting at the toll office, and said to him, Follow me. And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Now when Jesus was eating in this man's house, several publicans and sinners placed themselves at table with him and his disciples: for many of these people followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>The Scribes and the Pharisees, seeing him eat with publicans and sinners, said to his disciples, Wherefore does he eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>Jesus, hearing this, replied, The whole need not a physician, but the sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>The disciples of John, and those of the Pharisees, accustomed to fasting, came to him and said, John's disciples, and those of the Pharisees, fast; why do not your disciples fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jesus answered, Do the bridesmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? While the bridegroom is with them they do not fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come when the bridegroom shall be take from them; and in those days they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No person sews a piece of undressed cloth on an old garment; otherwise the new patch tears the old cloth, and makes a worse rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>No person puts new wine into old leather bottles; else the new wine bursts the bottle; and thus both the wine is split, and the bottles are rendered useless; but new wine must be put into new bottles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>Once, when he was going through the corn on the Sabbath, his disciples began to pluck the ears of corn as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>The Pharisees said to him, Why do they that which on the Sabbath, it is unlawful to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>He answered, Did you never read what David and his attendants did, in a strait, when they were hungry,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered the tabernacle of God, in the days of Abiathar the high priest, and eat the loaves of the presence, which none but the priests could lawfully eat, and gave of them also to his attendants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>He added, The Sabbath was made for man, and not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>Therefore the Son of Man is master even of the Sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>At another time he entered the synagogue, when a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they, with a design to accuse Jesus, watched him, to see whether he would heal the man on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>Jesus said to the man, who had the withered hand, Stand up in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then he said to them, Whether it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath, or to do evil-to save, or to kill? But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking around on them with anger, being grieved for the blindness of their minds, he said to the man, Stretch out your hand: and as he stretched out his hand, it was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees went out immediately, and conspired with the Herodians against him to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>But Jesus withdrew with his disciples toward the sea, whither a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>from Jerusalem, from Idumea, and from the banks of the Jordan. They also of the territories of Tyre and Sidon, having heard what wonders he had performed, flocked to him in crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>Then he ordered his disciples to get a boat to attend him, because of the multitude, lest they should throng him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>for he had healed many, which made all, who had maladies, press upon him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, when they beheld him, prostrated themselves before him, crying, Thou art the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>But he strictly charged them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>Afterward Jesus went up a mountain, and called to him whom he would, and they went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he selected twelve, that they might attend him, and that he might commission them to make proclamation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>empowering them to cure disease; and to expel demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>These were Simon, whom he surnamed Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James, son of Zebedee, and John, the brother of James. These he surnamed Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James son of Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and Simon the Canaanite</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>Then they went into a house, whither a crowd again assembled, so that Jesus and his disciples could not so such as eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>His kinsmen hearing this, went out to restrain it, (for they said, He is beside himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who came from Jerusalem, said, He is confederate with Beelzebub, and expels demons by the prince of demons.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>Jesus having called them, said to them by similitudes, How can Satan expel Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If a kingdom be torn by factions, that kingdom can not subsist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a family be torn by factions, that family can not subsist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>Thus, if Satan fight against himself, and be divided, he can not subsist, but is near his end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one who enters the strong one's house, can plunder his goods, unless he first overpower the strong one; then, indeed, he may plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Indeed, I say to you, that though all other sins in the sons of men are pardonable, and whatever slanders they shall utter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>whosoever shall speak slanderously against the Holy Spirit, shall never be pardoned, but be liable to eternal punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>He said this because they affirmed he was leagued with an unclean spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Meanwhile came his mother and brothers, who standing without, sent for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And the crowd who sat round him, said to him, Lo, your mother and brothers are without, and seek you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>He answered them, saying, Who is my mother or my brothers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking about on those who sat around him, he said, Behold my mother and my brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>for whosoever does the will of God, is my brother, my sister, and mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Again, he was teaching by the sea side, when so great a multitude gathered about him, that he was obliged to go aboard a bark, and sit there, while all the people remained on shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>Then he taught them many things by parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>In teaching, he said to them, Attend, behold the sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And as he sowed, part of the seed fell by the way-side, and the birds came and picked it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Part fell upon rocky ground, where it had little mold. This sprang sooner, because there was no depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>But after the sun had beaten upon it, it was scorched, and having no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Part fell among thorns; and the thorns grew up and stifled it, so that it yielded nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>Part fell into good ground, and sprang up, and became so fruitful, that some grains produced thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>He added. Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When he was in private, those who were about him with the twelve, asked him the meaning of the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>He said to them, It is your privilege to know the secrets of the Reign of God, but to those without everything is veiled in parables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that they may not perceive what they look at, or understand what they hear; lest they should be reclaimed, and obtain the forgiveness of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>He said also to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower is he who disperses the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>The wayside on which some of the grain fell, denotes those who have no sooner heard the word, than Satan comes, and takes away that which was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>The rocky ground denotes those, who, hearing the word, receive it first with pleasure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>yet not having it rooted in their minds, retain it but a while; for when trouble or persecution comes because of the word, they instantly relapse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>The ground overrun with thorns, denotes those hearers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>in whom worldly cares, and delusive riches, and the inordinate desire of other things, stifle the word, and render it unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>The good soil on which some grains yielded thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred, denotes those who hear the word, and retain it, and produce the fruits thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>He said further, Is a lamp brought to be put under a vessel, or under a bed, and not to be set on a stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is no secret, that is not discovered; nor has anything been concealed, which is not to be divulged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man have ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>He said, moreover, Consider what you hear: with the measure with which you give, you shall receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For to him who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>He said also, The kingdom of God is like seed, which a man sowed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>While he slept by night, and waked by day, the seed shot up, and grew without his minding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth produces of itself first the blade, then the ear; afterward the full corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But as soon as the grain was ripe, he applied the sickle, because it was time to reap it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>He said also, To what shall we compare the kingdom of God, or by what similitude shall we represent it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, is the smallest of all the seeds that are there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>But after it is sown, it springs up, and becomes greater than any herb, and shoots out branches so large, that under their shades, the birds of the air may find shelter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And in many such similitudes, he conveyed instruction to the people, as he found them disposed to hear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>and without a similitude he told them nothing; but he solved all to his disciples in private.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>That day, in the evening, he said to them, Let us pass to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And they, leaving the people, but having him in the bark, set sail in company with other small barks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>Then there arose a great storm of wind which drove the billows into the bark, which was now full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>Jesus being in the stern, asleep on a pillow, they awake him, saying, Rabbi, do you not care that we perish?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he arose, and commanded the wind, saying to the sea, Peace! be still! Immediately the wind ceased, and great calm ensued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said to them, Why are you so timorous? How is it that you have no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they were exceedingly terrified, and said one to another, Who is this, whom even the wind and the sea obey?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>Then they crossed the sea, and came into the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>He was no sooner gone ashore, than there met him a man coming from the monuments, possessed of an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who made his abode in the tombs; and no man could confine him, not even with chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>and broken the fetters, so that no person was able to tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>He was continually, night and day, in the mountains, and in the tombs, howling, and cutting himself with flints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But when he saw Jesus afar off, he ran, and prostrating himself before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>cried out, What hast thou to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I conjure thee by God not to torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>(For Jesus had said to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>Jesus asked him, What is your name? He answered, My name is Legion, for we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he earnestly entreated him not to drive them out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was a great herd of swine feeding on the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And the fiends besought him, saying, Suffer us to go to the swine, that we may enter into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>Jesus immediately permitted them. Then the unclean spirits being gone out, entered into the swine; and the herd, in number about two thousand, rushed down a precipice into the sea, and were choked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And the swineherds fled, and told it in the city and villages. And the people flocked out to see what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>When they came to Jesus, and saw him who had been possessed by the legion, sitting, and clothed, and in his right mind, they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who had seen the whole, having related to them what had happened to the demoniac, and to the swine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>they entreated him to leave their territories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>As he entered the bark, the man who had been possessed, begged permission to attend him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>Jesus however did not permit him, but said, Go home to your relations, and tell them what great things the Lord, in pity, has done for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>Accordingly he departed, publishing in Decapolis, what great things Jesus had done for him. And they were all amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>Jesus having repassed in the bark, a great crowd gathered round him, while he was on the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>Then came one of the directors of the synagogue, named Jairus, who seeing him threw himself at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and entreated him earnestly, saying, My little daughter is in extreme danger; I pray you come and lay your hands upon her and to heal her, and she will be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And Jesus went with him, followed by a great multitude who thronged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And a woman, who had been twelve years distressed with an issue of blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>who had suffered much from several physicians, and spent her all without receiving any relief, but rather growing worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>having heard of Jesus, came in the crowd, behind, and touched his mantle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>for she had said, If I but touch his cloths, I shall recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>Instantly the source of her distemper was dried up, and she felt in her body, that she was delivered from that scourge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Jesus immediately, conscious of the virtue which had issued from him, turned toward the crowd, saying, Who touched my clothes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>His disciples answered, You see how the multitude throng you; yet you say, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>But he looked round him, to see her who had done it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>Then the woman, knowing the change wrought upon her, came trembling with fear, threw herself prostrate before him, and confessed the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>But he said to her, Daughter, your faith has cured you; go in peace, released from this scourge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>Before he had done speaking, messengers came from the house of the director of the synagogue, who said, Your daughter is dead, why should you trouble the teacher any further?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>Jesus hearing this message delivered, said immediately to the director, Fear not; only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he allowed no person to follow him except Peter and James, and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>Being arrived at the director's house, and seeing the tumult, and the people weeping and wailing immoderately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>he said to them, as he entered, Why do you weep and make a bustle? The child is not dead, but asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they derided him. But having made them all go out, he took with him the child's father and mother, and those who came with him; and he entered the chamber where she was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>and, taking her by the hand, said to her, Talitha cumi, (which signified, Young woman, arise,) I command you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>Immediately the maid arose and walked, for she was twelve years old; and they were confounded with astonishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>But he strictly enjoined them not to mention it to any person, and ordered that something should be given her to eat.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>Jesus, leaving that place, went to his own country, accompanied by his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And on the Sabbath he taught in their synagogues, and many who heard him, said with astonishment, Whence has this man these abilities? What wisdom is this which he has gotten? and how are so great miracles performed by him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James and Joses, and Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters also here with us? And they were offended at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>But Jesus said to them, A prophet is no where disregarded, except in his own country, and amongst his own relations, and in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he could do no miracle there, excepting curing a few sick by laying his hands on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he wondered at their unbelief. And he went through the neighboring villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And having called to him the twelve, he sent them out two by two, and gave them power over the unclean spirits;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>and ordered them to take nothing for their journey, but a single staff; no bag, no bread, and in their girdle no money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>to be shod with sandals, and not to put on two coats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>He said also, Whatever house you enter in any place, continue in that house, till you leave the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>But wheresoever they will not receive you, nor hear you, shake off the dust under your feet at your departure, as a protestation against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And being departed, they publicly warned men to reform;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>and expelled many demons, and cured many sick persons, anointing them with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And King Herod heard of him, (for his name was become famous) and said, John the Immerser is raised from the dead; and therefore miracles are performed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others said, It is Elijah. Others, It is a prophet like those of ancient times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herod heard of him, he said, This is John whom I beheaded. He is raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod had caused John to be apprehended, and kept bound in prison, on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom he had himself married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John had said to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>Now this roused Herodias' resentment, who would have killed John, but could not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>because Herod respected him, and knowing him to be a just and holy man, protected him; and did many things recommended by him, and heard him with pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>At length a favorable opportunity offered, which was Herod's birthday, when he made an entertainment for the great officers of his court and army, and the persons of distinction in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>For the daughter of Herodias came in, and danced before them, and pleased Herod and his guests so much, that the king said to the young woman, Ask whatever you will, and I will give it you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>nay, he swore to her, Whatsoever you shall ask, I will give it you, were it the half of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>And she withdrew, and said to her mother, What shall I ask? She answered, The head of John the Immerser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>Her daughter then, returning hastily to the king, made this request: I would that you give me presently in a basin, the head of John the Immerser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And the king was much grieved; however, from a regard to his oath, and his guests, he would not refuse her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>and immediately dispatched a sentinel with orders to bring the Immerser's head. Accordingly he went, and beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought his hand in a basin, and presented it to the young woman; and the young woman presented it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When his disciples heard this, they went and brought his corpse, and laid it in a monument.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>Now the Apostles, being assembled, related everything to Jesus, both what they had done, and what they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And he said to them, Come you apart into a desert place, and rest awhile; for there were so many coming and going, that they had not leisure so much as to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>And they retired by ship to a desert place, to be by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>But many who saw them depart, and knew whither they were sailing, ran out of all the cities, and came together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>Being landed, he saw a great multitude, and had compassion on them; because they were as a flock which has no shepherd; and he taught them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>When it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, This is a desert place, and it is now late;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>dismiss the people, that they may go to the neighboring farms and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>He answering, said to them, Supply them yourselves. They replied, Shall we go and give two hundred denarii for bread, in order to supply them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>He said to them, How many loaves have you? Go and see. Upon inquiry, they answered, Five and two fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>And he commanded them to make all the people recline upon the green grass in separate companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they formed themselves into squares, by hundred and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>Then Jesus taking the five loaves and the two fishes, and looking up to heaven, blessed and broke the loaves, and gave them to his disciples to set before the multitude. He distributed also the two fishes among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>When they all had eat and were satisfied,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>they carried off twelve baskets full of the fragments of the bread and the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Now they who had eat of the loaves, were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he obliged his disciples to embark, and pass over before, toward Bethsaida, while he dismissed the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And having sent them away, he retired to a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>In the evening, the bark being in the midst of the sea, and he alone on the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>he observed them toiling at the oar, for the wind was against them: and about the fourth watch of the night, he went to them, walking on the water. and seemed intending to pass by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>When they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was an apparition, and cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>For they all saw him, and were terrified; but he immediately spoke to them, saying, Take courage; it is I; be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And having gone aboard to them, the wind ceased, which struck them still more with astonishment and admiration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for their minds were so stupefied, that they never reflected upon the loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>When they had crossed, they came to the territory of Gennesaret, where they landed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And being come ashore, the people knew him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>and ran through all that country, carrying the sick on couches, to every place where they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And whatever village, or city, or town he entered, they laid the diseased in the streets, and besought him, that they might touch, were it but a tuft of his mantle; and whosoever touched him, were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Now the Pharisees, and some scribes who came from Jerusalem, resorted to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>And observing some of his disciples eating with impure hands, that is, unwashed hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(for the Pharisees, and indeed all the Jews who observed the tradition of the elders, eat not until they have washed their hands by pouring a little water upon them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>and if they be come from the market, by dipping them; and many other usages there are, which they have adopted, as immersions of cups and pots, and brazen vessels and beds:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>then the Pharisees and Scribes asked him, Whence comes it that your disciples observe not the tradition of the elders, but eat with unwashed hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>He answering, said to them, O hypocrites! well do you suit the character, which Isaiah gave of you, when he said, This people honor me with their lips; but their heart is estranged from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>«In vain, however, they worship me, while they teach institutions merely human.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>For laying aside the commandment of God, you retain the traditions of men, immersions of pots and cups, and many other similar practices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>You judge well, continued he, in annulling the commandment of God, to make room for your traditions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>«For Moses has said,» 'Honor your father and mother' 'and '«Whosoever reviles father or mother, shall be punished with death.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>«But you maintain, if a man say to father or mother,'Be it corban (that is, devoted) whatever of mine shall profit you';»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>he must not thenceforth do anything for his father or mother;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>thus invalidating the word of God, by the tradition which you have established. And in many other instances you act thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>Then having called the whole multitude, he said to them, Hearken to me all of you, and be instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing from without, which entering into the man, can pollute him; but the things which proceed from within the man, are the things that pollute him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>When he had withdrawn from the people into a house, his disciples asked him the meaning of that sentence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>He answered, Are you also void of understanding? Do you not perceive, that whatsoever from without enters into the man, can not pollute him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it enters not into his heart, but into his stomach, whence all impurities in the victuals pass into the sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>But, added he, that which proceeds out of the man, is what pollutes the man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>for from within the human heart proceed vicious machinations, adulteries, fornications, murders, thefts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>insatiable desires, malevolence, fraud, immodesty, envy, calumny, arrogance, levity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evils issue from within, and pollute the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>Then he arose, and went to the frontiers of Tyre and Sidon; and having entered a house, he desired that none might know of him; but he could not be concealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>For a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, hearing of him, came and threw herself at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>(the woman was a Greek, a native of Syrophenicia,) and entreated him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>Jesus answered, Let the children first be satisfied; for it is not seemly to take the children bread, and throw it to the dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>She replied, True, Sir; yet even the dogs under the table eat of the children's crumbs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>He said to her, For this answer go home; the demon is gone out of your daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>Immediately she went home, and found her daughter lying upon the bed, and freed from the demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Then leaving the borders of Tyre and Sidon, he returned to the sea of Galilee, through the precincts of Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>And they brought to him a deaf man, who had also an impediment in his speech, and entreated him to lay his hand upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>Jesus having taken him aside from the crowd, spit upon his own fingers, and put them into the man's ears, and touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>Then looking up to heaven, and sighing, he said, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>Immediately his ears were opened, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke distinctly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>He charged them to tell no person: but the more he charged them, the more they published it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>saying with inexpressible amazement, He does everything well: he makes both the deaf to hear, and the dumb to speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>At that time the crowd being very numerous, and having no food, he called his disciple, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>I have compassion on the multitude; for they attend me now three days, and have nothing to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>and if I send them home fasting, their strength will fail by the way; for some of them have come from afar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>His disciples answered, Whence can we supply these people with bread here in the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>He asked them, How many loaves have you? They said, Seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>Then commanding the multitude to place themselves upon the ground, he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, broke them, and gave them to his disciples, that they might distribute them to the people, and they distributed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>They had also a few small fishes, which, after blessing, he likewise ordered to be presented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>So they eat, and were satisfied; and the fragments which remained, were carried off in seven hand-baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Now they who had eat were about four thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>Having dismissed them, he immediately embarked with his disciples, and went into the territory of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>Thence some Pharisees came, who began to argue with him; and in order to prove him, demanded of him a sign in the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>Jesus answered with a deep groan, Wherefore does this generation require a sign? Indeed, I say to you, that no sign shall be given to this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>After that, leaving them, he re-embarked and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>Now the disciples had forgot to bring bread, having only one loaf with them in the bark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>Then Jesus gave them this caution: Attend; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, and of the leaven of Herod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>They reflecting upon it, said among themselves, It is because we have no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>Jesus remarking it, said to them, Why do you make this reflection, hat you have no bread? Are you yet so thoughtless, so inattentive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Is your understanding still blinded? Have you no us of your eyes, or of your ears? or do you not remember</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>when I distributed the five loaves among five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you carry off? They answered, Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>And when the seven among four thousand, how many hand-baskets full of the fragments did you carry off? They said, Seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>How then is it, proceeded he, that you do not apprehend me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>When Jesus came to Bethsaida, they brought to him a blind man, whom they entreated him to touch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>He took the blind man by the hand, and led him out of the village. Then having put spittle on his eyes, and laid his hands upon him, he asked him whether he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>Having looked up, he said, I see men, as trees walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>And Jesus laid his hands upon the man's eyes, and made him look again. And he was so perfectly cured, as to see every object clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And Jesus sent him home, saying, Neither go into the village, nor tell anything to any of the villagers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>Jesus went thence with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and by the way asked them, saying, Who do men say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>They answered, John the Immerser; but some say, Elijah; and others, One of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answering, said to him, You are the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>Then he charged them to tell no person this concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And he began to inform them, that the Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders, and the chief priests, and the scribes, and be killed, and that in three days he must rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>This he spoke so plainly, that Peter, taking him aside, reproved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But he turning, and looking on his disciples, rebuked Peter, saying, Get you hence, adversary, for you do not relish the things of God, but the things of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>Then having called both to the people, and to his disciples, he said, Is any willing to come under my guidance? Let him renounce himself, and take up his cross, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life, for my sake and the gospel's, shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>What would it profit a man, if he should gain the whole world, with the forfeit of his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>or what will a man not give in ransom for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, in this adulterous and sinful generation; of him likewise the Son of man will be ashamed, when he shall come in the glory of his Father, accompanied by the holy angels.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.9'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>He added, Indeed, I say to you, there are some standing here, who shall not taste death, till they see the Reign of God ushered in with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>After six days, Jesus took Peter, and James, and John, apart to the top of a high mountain, and was transfigured in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>His garments became glittering, and were like snow, of such whiteness as no fuller on the earth could imitate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>There appeared to them also Elijah and Moses, who were conversing with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>Then Peter said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good for us to stay here: let us make three booths, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>for he knew not what he said, they were so terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And there came a cloud which covered them; and out of the cloud issued a voice, which said, This is my Son, the beloved: hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And instantly, looking about, they saw no person but Jesus and themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>As they went down from the mountain, he charged them not to relate to any person what they had seen, till the Son of Man was risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And they took notice of that expression, and inquired among themselves what the rising from the dead could mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>Then they asked him, saying, Why do the scribes affirm that Elijah must come first?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>He answered, Elijah, to consummate the whole, must come first; and, (as it is written of the Son of Man,) must likewise suffer many things and be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>But I tell you, that Elijah too is come, as was predicted, and they have treated him as they pleased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>When he returned to the other disciples, he saw a great multitude about them, and some scribes disputing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>As soon as the people saw him, they were all struck with awe, and ran to salute him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he asked the scribes, About what do you dispute with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>One of the people answering, said, Rabbi, I have brought you my son, who has a dumb spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>and wheresoever it seizes him, it dashes him on the ground, where he continues foaming, and grinding his teeth, till his strength is exhausted. And I spoke to your disciples to expel the demon, but they were not able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>Jesus then said, O unbelieving generation! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I suffer you? Bring him to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>Accordingly they brought him: and no sooner did he see him, than the spirit threw him into convulsions, so that he foamed, and rolled upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>Jesus asked the father, How long is it since this first befell him? He answered, From his infancy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>and often it has thrown him both into the fire, and into the water, to destroy him; but if you can do anything, have compassion upon us and help us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus replied, If you can believe; all things are practicable for him who believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>The boy's father, crying out immediately, said with tears, I believe; Master, supply the defects of my faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>When Jesus saw that the people came crowding upon him, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, Dumb and deaf spirit, come out of him, I command you, and enter no more into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>Then, having cried aloud and severely convulsed him, it came out, and he appeared as one dead, insomuch that many said, He is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus taking him by the hand, raised him, and he stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>When Jesus was come into the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could not we expel the demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>He answered, This kind can not be dislodged unless by prayer and fasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>Having left that place, they pass through Galilee; and he was desirous that no person should know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>for he was instructing his disciples. And he said to them, The Son of Man will soon be delivered into the hands of men, who will kill him; and after he is killed, he will rise again the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they understood not what he meant, and were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>When he was come to Capernaum, being in the house, he asked them, What were you debating amongst yourselves by the way?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they were silent; for they had debated amongst themselves by the way, who should be greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>Then having sat down, he called the twelve, and said to them, If any man would be first, he shall be the last of all, and the servant of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And he took a child, and placed him in the midst of them, and holding him in his arms, said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>Whosoever shall receive one such child on my account, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, receives not me, but him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>Then John said to him, Rabbi, we saw one expelling demons in your name, who follows not us, and we forbade him, because he does not follow us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>Jesus answered, Forbid him not; for there is none that works a miracle in my name, that can readily speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>For whosoever is not against you is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>For whosoever shall give you a cup of water to drink on my account, because you are Christ's; indeed, I say to you, he shall not lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>But whoever shall ensnare any of the little ones, who believe in me, it were better for him that a millstone were fastened to his neck, and that he were thrown into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>Moreover, if your hand ensnare you, cut it off; it is better for you to enter maimed into life, than having two hands to go into hell, into the unquenchable fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.44'>where their worm dies not, and their fire is not quenched.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.14'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>After two days was the feast of the passover, and of unleavened bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were contriving how they might take Jesus by surprise, and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>They said, however, Not during the festival, for fear of an insurrection among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>Now being at table in Bethany, in the house of Simon, formerly a leper, there came a woman with an alabaster box of the balsam of spikenard, which was very costly; and she broken open the box, and poured the liquor upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>There were some present, who said with indignation, Why this profusion of the balsam?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>For it could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii, which might have been given to the poor. And they murmured against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said, Let her alone. Why do you molest her? She has done me a good office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.7'>For you will have the poor always amongst you, and can do them good whenever you please; but me you will not always have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.8'>She has done what she could. She has beforehand embalmed my body for the funeral.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.9'>Indeed, I say to you, in whatsoever corner of the world the glad tidings shall be proclaimed, what this woman has now done, shall be mentioned to her honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, repaired to the chief priests, to betray Jesus to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>And they listened to him with joy, and promised to give him money. Afterward he sought a favorable opportunity to deliver him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>Now the first day of unleavened bread, when the passover is sacrificed, his disciples said to him, Whither shall we go to prepare for your eating the passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.13'>Then he sent two of his disciples, saying to them, Go into the city, where you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.14'>and wherever he shall enter, say to the master of the house, The Teacher says, Where is the guest chamber, in which I may eat the passover with my disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.15'>And he will show you a large upper room ready furnished. There prepare for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.16'>Accordingly, his disciples went away, and being come into the city, found everything as he had told them, and prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.17'>In the evening he went thither with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.18'>As they were at table eating, Jesus said, Indeed, I say to you, that one of you who eats with me, will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.19'>Upon this they became very sorrowful; and asked him, all of them, one after another, Is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.20'>He answering, said to them, It is one of the twelve; he who dips his morsel in the dish with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.21'>The Son of Man departs in the manner foretold in the scripture concerning him; but alas for that man! by whom the Son of Man is betrayed: it had been better for that man never to have been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.22'>While they were at supper, Jesus took bread, and after blessing, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, Take; this is my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>Then he took the cup, and having given thanks, gave it to them; and they all drank of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.24'>And he said to them, This is my blood, the blood of the new institution, shed for many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.25'>Indeed, I say to you, that I will drink no more of the product of the vine, till that day when I shall drink it new in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.26'>And after the hymn, they went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.27'>«And Jesus said to them, This night I shall prove a stumbling stone to you all; for it is written,'I will smite the Shepherd, and the sheep shall be dispersed.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.28'>Nevertheless, after I am raised again, I will go before you to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.29'>Peter then said to him, Though they all should stumble, I never will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.30'>Jesus answered him, Indeed, I say to you, that today, this very night, before the cock crow twice, even you will disown me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.31'>But Peter insisted on it, adding, Although I should die with you, I will never disown you. And all the rest said the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.32'>Then they came to a place named Gethsemane, where he said to his disciples, Stay here while I pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.33'>And he took with him Peter, and James, and John, and being seized with grief and horror,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.34'>said to them, My soul is overwhelmed with a deadly anguish; tarry here and watch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>And going a little before, he threw himself on the ground, and prayed that, if it were possible, he might be delivered from that hour,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.36'>and said, Abba, (that is, Father,) all things are possible to thee; take this cup away from me; yet not what I would, but what thou wilt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.37'>Then he returned, and finding them asleep, said to Peter, Simon, do you sleep? Could you not keep awake a single hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>Watch and pray, that you be not overcome by temptation: the spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.39'>Again, he retired and prayed, using the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.40'>When he returned, he again found them sleeping; for their eyes were overpowered, and they knew not what to answer him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.41'>A third time he came, and said to them, Do you now sleep, and take your rest? All is over: the hour is come: and the Son of Man is delivered into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.42'>Arise. Let us be going. Lo! he who betrays me is drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.43'>Immediately, before he had done speaking, appeared Judas, one of the twelve, with a great multitude armed with swords and clubs, who were sent by the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.44'>Now the betrayer had given them this signal: The man whom I shall kiss, is he; seize him, and lead him away safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.45'>He was no sooner come, than accosting Jesus, he said, Rabbi, Rabbi, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>Then they laid hands on him and seized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>But one of those who were present, drew his sword, and smiting the high priest's servant, cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>Then Jesus addressing them, said, Do you come with swords and clubs to apprehend me, like people in pursuit of a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>I was daily amongst you, teaching in the temple, and you did not arrest me. But in this the scriptures are accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>Then they all forsook him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>Now there followed him a youth, who had only a linen cloth wrapped about his body; the soldiers having laid hold of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>he left the cloth, and fled from them naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>Then they took Jesus away to the high priest, with whom all the chief priests, the elders, and the scribes, were convened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>And Peter followed him at a distance, as far as the court of the high priest's house, and sat there with the officers, warming himself at the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>Meanwhile, the chief priests, and all the Sanhedrin, sought for evidence against Jesus, in order to condemn him to die, but found none:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>for many gave false testimony against him, but their testimonies were insufficient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>The some arose, who testified falsely against him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>We heard him say, I will demolish this temple made with hands, and in three days will build another without hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But even here their testimony was defective.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>Then the high priest, standing up in the midst, interrogated Jesus, saying, Do you answer nothing to what these men testify against you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he was silent, and gave no answer. Again, the high priest interrogating him, said, Are you the Messiah, the Son of the blessed One?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>Jesus answered, I am; nay, you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Almighty, and coming in the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest rent his garments, saying, What further need have we of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You have heard the blasphemy. What is your opinion? And they all pronounced him worthy of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Then some began to spit on him; others to cover his face and buffet him, saying to him, Divine who it is. And the officers gave him blows on the cheeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Now Peter being below in the court, one of the maids of the high priest came thither,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>who seeing Peter warming himself, looked on him, and said, You also were with the Nazarene Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, saying, I know him not: nor do I understand what you mean. Immediately he went out into the portico, and the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>The maid seeing him again, said to the bystanders, This is one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>Again he denied. And a little after, those who were present said to Peter, You are certainly one of them; for you are a Galilean, your speech shows it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>Upon this he affirmed, with imprecations, and oaths, that he did not know the man of whom they spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>The cock crew the second time: and Peter recollected the word which Jesus had said to him, Before the cock crow twice, you will disown me thrice. And reflecting upon this, he wept.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>Early in the morning, the chief priests, with the elders, the scribes, and all the Sanhedrin, after consulting together, bound Jesus, carried him away, and delivered him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Pilate, asking him, said, You are the king of the Jews? He answered, You say right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>Now the chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>Again Pilate asked him, saying, Do you answer nothing? Observe how many crimes they arraign you for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus answered no more, insomuch that Pilate was astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now, at the festival, he always released to them any one prisoner, whom they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was one Barabbas, that had been imprisoned with his seditious associates, who in their sedition had committed murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And, with clamor, the multitude demanded of Pilate, what he used to grant them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>He answered them, saying, Shall I release to you the king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>(For he knew that through envy, the chief priests had delivered him up.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests incited the multitude to insist on the release of Barabbas, in preference to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>Pilate again interposed, saying, What then would you have me do with him whom you call king of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>They cried, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Pilate asked them, Why? What evil has he done? But they cried the more vehemently, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>Then Pilate, desirous to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and having caused Jesus to be scourged, delivered him up to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers brought him into the hall called praetorium, where, having convened all the band,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>they arrayed him in purple, and crowned him with a wreath of thorns,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and saluted him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>Then they struck him on the head with a reed, and spit upon him, and paid him homage on their knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, the stripped him of the purple, and dressed him in his own clothes, and took him away to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they constrained one Simon, a Cyrenian, who passed by, in coming from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought him to Golgotha, (that is to say, The Place of Skulls,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>where they gave him wine to drink, mingled with myrrh, which he would not receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>When they had nailed him to the cross, they parted his garments, dividing by lot what every man should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>Now it was the third hour, when they nailed him to the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription, bearing the cause of his death, was in these words, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>They likewise crucified two robbers with him, one at his right hand, and the other at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>«And the scripture was fulfilled, which says,» 'He was ranked with malefactors.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>Meanwhile, they who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads, and saying, Ah! you who could demolish the temple, and rebuild it in three days!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself, and come down from the cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>The chief priests likewise, with the scribes, deriding him, said among themselves, He saved others; can not he save himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Messiah, the King of Israel, descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe! Even those who were crucified with him reproached him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth, darkness covered all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>At the ninth hour, Jesus cried aloud saying, Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani! which signifies, My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>Some who were present, hearing this, said, Hark! he calls Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>One at the same time ran, and dipped a sponge in vinegar, and having fastened it to a stick, presented it to him to drink, saying, Let alone, we shall see whether Elijah will come to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus sending forth a cry expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>Then was the vail of the temple rent in two, from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And the centurion who stood opposite observing that he expired with so loud a cry, said, Surely, this man was a son of a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were women also looking on at a distance, amongst whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger, and of Joses and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>(these had followed him, and served him, when he was in Galilee,) and several others, who came with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>When it was evening, (because it was the preparation, that is, the eve of the Sabbath,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, an honorable senator, who himself also expected the Reign of God, taking courage, repaired to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>Pilate, amazed that he was so soon dead, sent for the centurion, and asked him whether Jesus had been dead any time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And being informed by the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>who having bought linen, and taking Jesus down, wrapped him in the linen; and laid him in a tomb, hewn out of the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Now Mary the Magdalene, and Mary the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>When the Sabbath was past, Mary the Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices that they might embalm Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said among themselves, Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb? (for it was very large.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>But when they looked, they saw that the stone had been rolled away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>Then entering the tomb, they beheld a youth sitting on the right side, clothed in a white robe, and they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, Be not frightened; you seek Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He is risen, he is not here: behold the place where they laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, say to his disciples, and to Peter, He is gone before you to Galilee; where you shall see him, as he told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>The women then getting out, fled from the tomb, seized with trembling and consternation; but said nothing to any one, they were so terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Jesus having arisen early the first day of the week, appeared first to Mary the Magdalene, out of whom he had cast seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and informed those who had attended him, who were in affliction and tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>But when they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they did not believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>Afterward he appeared in another form to two of them, as they traveled on foot into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>These being returned, informed the other disciples, but neither did they believe him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>At length he appeared to the eleven, as they were eating, and reproached them with their incredulity and obstinacy, in disbelieving those who had seen him after his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said unto them, Go throughout all the world, proclaim the glad tidings to the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who shall believe, and be immersed, shall be saved; but he who shall not believe, shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these miraculous powers shall attend the believers:- In my name they shall expel demons. They shall speak in languages unknown to them before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>They shall handle serpents with safety. And if they drink poison, it shall not hurt them. They shall cure the sick by laying their hands upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>Now, after the Lord had spoken to them, he was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>As for them, they went out and proclaimed the tidings everywhere, the Lord co-operating with them, and confirming their doctrine by the miracles with which it was accompanied.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>They were both righteous before God, blameless observers of all the Lord's commandments and ordinances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>Now when he came to officiate as priest in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>it fell to him by lot, according to the custom of the priesthood, to offer incense in the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And while the incense was burning, the whole congregation were praying without.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>Then there appeared to him an angel of the Lord, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zacharias was discomposed at the sight, and in great terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias; for your prayer is heard, and Elizabeth your wife shall bear you a son, whom you shall name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>He shall be to you matter of joy and transport; and many shall rejoice because of his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before the Lord; he shall not drink wine nor any fermented liquor; but he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the sons of Israel he shall bring back to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>Moreover, he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to reconcile fathers to their children, and by the wisdom of the righteous, to render the disobedient a people well disposed for the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this: for I am old man, and my wife is advanced in years?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>The angel answering, said to him, I am Gabriel, who attend in the presence of God, and am sent to tell you this joyful news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>But know that you shall be dumb, and shall not recover your speech, till the day when these things happen, because you have not believed my words, which shall be fulfilled in due time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>Meanwhile the people waited for Zacharias, and wondered that he staid so long in the sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when he came out, he could not speak to them; and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary; for he made them understand by signs, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And when his days of officiating were expired, he returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>Soon after, Elizabeth his wife conceived, and lived in retirement five months, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>The Lord has done this for me, purposing now to deliver me from the reproach I lay under among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now, in the sixth month, God sent Gabriel his angel, to Nazareth, a city of Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man called Joseph, of the house of David, and the virgin's name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>When the angel entered, he said to her, Hail, favorite of heaven! the Lord be with you, happiest of women!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>At his appearance and words, she was perplexed, and revolved in her mind what this salutation could mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you shall conceive and bear a son, whom you shall name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest. And the Lord God will give him the throne of David his Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever: his reign shall never end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, since I have no intercourse with man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel answering, said to her, The Holy Spirit will descend upon you, and the power of the Highest will overshadow you; therefore the holy progeny shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And lo! your cousin Elizabeth also has conceived, a son in her old age; and she who is called barren, is now in her sixth month;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>for nothing is impossible with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord. Be it to me according to your word. Then the angel departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>In those days Mary set out, and traveled expeditiously into the hill country; to a city of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>where having entered the house of Zacharias, she saluted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>As soon as Elizabeth heard Mary's salutation, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>and cried with a loud voice, You are the most blessed of women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>But how have I deserved this honor, to be visited by the mother of my Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>for know, that as soon as the sound of your salutation reached my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And happy is she who believed that the things which the Lord has promised her, shall be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Then Mary said, My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit rejoices in God my Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>because he has not disdained the low condition of his handmaid; for henceforth, all posterity will pronounce me happy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For the Almighty, whose name is venerable, has done wonders for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>His mercy on them who fear him, extends to generations of generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He displays the strength of his arm, and dispels the vain imaginations of the proud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He pulls down potentates from their thrones, and exalts the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>The needy he loads with benefits; but the rich he spoils of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He supports Israel his servant, ever inclined to mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>(as he promised to our fathers) toward Abraham and his race.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary, after staying with Elizabeth about three months, returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>When the time for Elizabeth's delivery was come, she brought forth a son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>and her neighbors and relations who heard that the Lord had shown her great kindness, rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And, on the eighth day, when they came to the circumcision of the child, they would have called him by his father's name, Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother interposed, saying, No; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>They said to her, There is none of your kindred of that name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>They, therefore, asked his father by signs, how he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>He, having demanded a table-book, wrote upon it, His name is John, which surprised them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened directly, and his tongue loosed. And he spoke, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Now all in the neighborhood were struck with awe; and the fame of these things spread throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all who heard these things, pondering them in their hearts, said, What will this child hereafter be? And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Then Zacharias, his father, being filled with the Holy Spirit, prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and redeemed his people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised a Prince for our deliverance in the house of David his servant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>(as anciently he promised by his holy prophets)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>for our deliverance from our enemies, and from the hands of all who hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>in kindness to our forefathers, and remembrance of his holy institution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And you, child, shall be called a prophet of the Most High; for you shall go before the Lord, to prepare his way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>by giving the knowledge of salvation to his people, in the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the tender compassion of our God, who has caused a light to spring from on high to visit us,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>When all went to be registered, every one of his own city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph also went from Nazareth, a city of Galilee, to a city of David in Judea, called Bethlehem, (for he was of the house and lineage of David,)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>While they were there, the time came, that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her first born son, and swathed him, and laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them in the house allotted to strangers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And when the angels returned to heaven, having left the shepherds, these said to one another, Let us go to Bethlehem, and see this which has happened, of which the Lord has informed us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>and said to him, All this power and glory I will give thee; for it is delivered to me, and to whomsoever I will, I give it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>if, therefore, thou wilt worship me, it shall all be thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>«Jesus answering, said, It is written,'Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>Then he brought him to Jerusalem, and placing him on the battlement of the temple, said to him, If thou be God's Son, throw thyself down hence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.10'>«for it is written,» 'He will give his angels charge concerning thee, to keep thee;'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.12'>«Jesus answered, It is said,'Thou shalt not put the Lord thy God to the proof.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.13'>When the devil had ended all the temptation, he departed from him for a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.14'>Then Jesus, by the impulse of the Spirit, returned to Galilee, and his renown spread throughout the whole country,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>and he taught in their synagogues with universal applause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>Being come to Nazareth, where he had been brought up, he entered the synagogue, as his custom was, on the Sabbath day, and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And they put into his hands the book of the Prophet Isaiah, and having opened the book, he found the place where it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.18'>«The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, inasmuch as he has anointed me to publish glad tidings to the poor, to announce liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind, to release the oppressed,»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.19'>«to proclaim the year of acceptance with the Lord.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.20'>And having closed the book, and returned it to the servant, he sat down. And the eyes of all in the synagogue were fixed upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.21'>And he began with saying to them, This very day, the scripture which you have just now heard, is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.22'>And all extolled him; but being astonished at the gracious words which he uttered, they said, Is not this Joseph's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.23'>«He said to them, You will doubtless apply to me this proverb,» 'Physician, cure yourself.' 'Do as great things here in your own country, as we hear you have done in Capernaum.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.24'>But in fact, added he, No prophet was ever well received in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>I tell you of a truth, there were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when heaven was shut up for three years and a half, so that there was great famine throughout all the land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.26'>yet to none of them was Elijah sent, but to a widow in Sarepta, of Sidonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.27'>There were likewise many lepers in Israel, in the days of Elisha the prophet; and Naaman the Syrian was cleansed, but none of those.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>On hearing this, the whole synagogue were enraged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>and breaking up, drove him out of the city, and brought him to the brow of the mountain on which their city was built, that they might throw him down headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But he, passing through the midst of them, went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Then he came to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were struck with awe at his manner of teaching; for he spoke with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>Now there was in the synagogue a man possessed by the spirit of an unclean demon, who roared out, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.34'>Ah! Jesus of Nazareth, what hast thou to do with us? Art thou come to destroy us? I know who thou art-the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him. On this, the demon, having thrown him into the middle of the assembly, came out without harming him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And they were all in amazement, and said one to another, What does this mean, that with authority and power he command the unclean spirits, and they come out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>From that time, his fame was published in every corner of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>When he was gone out of the synagogue, he entered the house of Simon, whose wife's mother had a violent fever, and they entreated him on her behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>Jesus, standing near her, rebuked the fever, and it left her, and she instantly arose, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>After sunset, all they who had any sick, of whatever kind of disease, brought them to him; and he, laying his hands on every one, cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>Demons also came out of many, crying out, Thou art the Son of God. But he rebuked them, and would not allow them to speak, because they knew that he was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>When it was day, he retired into a desert place; and the multitude sought him out, and came to him, and urged him not to leave them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>but he said to them, I must publish the good tidings of the Reign of God in other cities also, because for this purpose I am sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>Accordingly, he made this publication in the synagogues of Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now it happened, as he stood by the lake Gennesaret, the multitude pressing upon him to hear the word of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>that seeing two barks aground, near the shore, the fishermen having landed to wash their nets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>he went aboard one of them, which was Simon's; and desiring him to put off a little from the land, sat down, and taught the people out of the bark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he had done speaking, he said to Simon, Launch out into deep water, and let down your nets for a draught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Simon answered, Master, we have toiled all night, and have caught nothing; nevertheless, at your word, I will let down the net.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>Having done this, they inclosed such a multitude of fishes, that the net began to break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they beckoned to their companions, in the other bark, to come and help them. And they came, and loaded both their barks, so that they were near sinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this, he threw himself at Jesus' knees, saying, Depart from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For the draught of fishes which they had taken had filled him and all his companions with terror,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>particularly James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were Simon's partners. And Jesus said to Simon, Fear not, henceforth you shall catch men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And having brought their barks to land, they forsook all, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>When he was in one of the neighboring cities, a man covered with leprosy, happened to see him, threw himself on his face, and besought him, saying, Master, if you will, you can cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>Jesus stretching out his hand, and touching him, said, I will; be you cleansed. That instant his leprosy departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he commanded him to tell no person. But go, said he, show yourself to the priest, and present the offered appointed by Moses, for notifying the people that you are cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>Yet so much the more was Jesus everywhere talked of, that vast multitudes flocked to hear him, and to be cured by him of their maladies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>And he withdrew into solitary places, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day, as he was teaching, and Pharisees, and doctors of law, who had come from Jerusalem, and from every town of Galilee and Judea, were sitting by, the power of the Lord was exerted in the sure of the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And, behold, some men carrying on a bed a man afflicted with a palsy, endeavored to bring him in, and place him before Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>but finding it impracticable, by reason of the crowd, they got upon the roof, and let him down through the tiling, with the little bed, in the midst before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>Jesus perceiving their faith, said, Man, your sins are forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>On which the Scribes and the Pharisees reasoned thus, Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Can any one forgive sins except God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>Jesus knowing their thoughts, addressed himself to them, and said, What are you reasoning in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Your sins are forgiven you; or to say, Arise, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins, Arise, said he to the palsied man, take up your bed, and return to your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>That instant he rose in their presence, took up his bed, and returned home, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>Seeing this, they were all struck with amazement and reverence, and glorified God, saying, We have seen wonderful things today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After this, he went out, and observing a publican, named Levi, sitting at the toll-office, said to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And he arose, left all, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made him a great entertainment in his own house, where there was a great company of publicans and others, at table with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>But the Scribes and the Pharisees of the place murmured, saying to his disciples, Why do you eat and drink with publicans and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answering, said to them, It is not the healthy, but the sick, who need a physician.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I am come to call, not the righteous, but sinners, to reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>Then they asked him, How is it that the disciples of John, and likewise those of the Pharisees, frequently fast and pray, but yours eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>He answered, Would you have the bridesmen fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them: in those days they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He added this similitude, No man mends an old mantle with new cloth; otherwise the new will rend the old; besides, the old and new will never suit each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>No person puts new wine into old leather bottles; otherwise, the new wine will burst the bottles, and thus the wine will be spoiled, and the bottles rendered useless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But if new wine be put into new bottles, both will be preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>Besides, a man, after drinking old wine, calls not immediately for new; for he says, The old is milder.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>On the Sabbath called second prime, as Jesus was passing through the cornfields, his disciples plucked the ears of corn, and rubbed them in their hands and eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>And some Pharisees said to them, Why do you that which it is not lawful to do on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jesus replying, said to them, Did you never read what David and his attendants did, when they were hungry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>how he entered the mansion of God, and took and eat the loaves of the presence, and gave also of this bread to his attendants; though it can not be lawfully eat by any but the priests?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>He added, The Son of Man is master even of the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>It happened also on another Sabbath, that he went into the synagogue and taught; and a man was there whose right hand was blasted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>Now the Scribes and the Pharisees watched, to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, that they might find matter for accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he, knowing their thoughts, said to the man, whose hand was blasted, Arise, and stand in the middle. And he arose and stood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>Then Jesus said to them, I would ask you, What is it lawful to do on the Sabbath? Good or ill? To save, or to destroy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And, looking around on them all, he said to the man, stretch out your hand; and in doing this, his hand was rendered sound like the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with madness, and consulted together, what they should do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>In those days, Jesus retired to a mountain to pray, and spent the whole night in an oratory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>When it was day, he called to him his disciples; and of them he chose twelve, whom he named Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.14'>Simon, whom he also named Peter, and Andrew, his brother, James, and John, Philip, and Bartholomew;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.15'>Matthew, and Thomas, James, son of Alpheus, and Simon called the Zealous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>Judas, brother of James, and Judas Iscariot, who proved a traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>Afterward, Jesus, coming down with them, stopped on a plain, where a company of his disciples, with a vast multitude from all parts of Judea, Jerusalem, and the maritime country of Tyre and Sidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>were come to hear him, and to be healed of their diseases. Those also who were infested with unclean spirits, came, and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>And every one strove to touch him, because a virtue came from him, which healed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>Then fixing his eyes on his disciples, he said, Happy you poor, for the kingdom of God is yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.21'>Happy you that hunger now, for you shall be satisfied! Happy you that weep now, for you shall laugh!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.22'>Happy shall you be when men shall hate you, and separate your from their society; yes, reproach and defame you, on account of the Son of Man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.23'>Rejoice on that day, and triumph, knowing that your reward in heaven is great! for thus did their fathers treat the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.24'>But alas, for you rich; for you have received your comforts!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.25'>Alas, for you that are full; for you shall hunger! Alas, for you who laugh now; for you shall mourn and weep!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.26'>Alas, when all men shall speak well of you; for so did their fathers of the false prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.27'>But I charge you, my hearers, love your enemies, do good to them who hate you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.28'>bless them who curse you, pray for them who traduce you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.29'>To him who smites you on one cheek, present the other; and from him who takes your mantle, withhold not your coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.30'>Give to every one who asks you; and from him who takes away your goods, do not demand them back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.31'>And as you would that men should do to you, do you likewise to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.32'>For if you love those who love you, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners love those who love them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.33'>And if you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.34'>And if you lend to those from whom you hope to receive, what thanks are you entitled to, since even sinners lend to sinners, that they may received as much in return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.35'>But love your enemies, do good and lend, nowise despairing; and your reward shall be great; and you shall be sons of the Most High; for he is kind to the ungrateful and malignant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.36'>Be therefore merciful, as your Father is merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.37'>Judge not, and you shall not be judged; condemn not, and you shall not be condemned; release, and you shall be released;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.38'>give, and you shall get: good measure, pressed down and shaken, and heaped, shall be poured into your lap; for the very measure you give to others you yourself shall receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.39'>He also used this comparison: Can the blind guide the blind? Will not both fall into a ditch?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.40'>The disciple is not above his teacher; but every finished disciple shall be as his teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.41'>And why do you observe the mote in your brother's eyes; but perceive not the splinter in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.42'>Or how can you say to your brothers, Brother, let me take out the mote which is in your eye, not considering that there is a splinter out of your own eye; then you will see to take out the mote which is in your brother's eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.43'>That is not a good tree which yields bad fruit; nor is that a bad tree which yields good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.44'>For every tree is known by its own fruit. Figs are not gathered off thorns; nor grapes off a bramble-bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.45'>The good man, out of the good treasure of his heart, brings that which is good: the bad man out of the bad treasure of his heart, brings that which is bad; for it is out of the fulness of the heart that the mouth speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.46'>But why do you, in addressing me, cry, Master, Master, and obey not my commands!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.47'>Whoever comes to me and hears my precepts, and practices them, I will show you whom he resembles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>he resembles a man who built a house, and digging deep, laid the foundation upon the rock: and when an inundation came, the torrent broke upon that house, but could not shake it; for it was founded upon rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But he who hears, and does not practice, resembles a man, who, without laying a foundation, built a house upon the earth: which, when the torrent broke against it, fell, and became a great pile of ruins.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>When he had finished his discourse in the audience of the people, he entered Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>And a centurion's servant, who was dear to his master, was sick, and in danger of dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>And the centurion, having heard concerning Jesus, sent to him Jewish elders, to entreat him to come and save his servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>When they came to Jesus, they earnestly besought him, saying, He is worthy of this favor;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>for he loves our nations; and it was he who built our synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them; and when he was not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, to say, Master, trouble not yourself; for I have not deserved that you should come under my roof;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>wherefore neither thought I myself fit to come into your presence; say but the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And they who had been sent, having returned to the house, found the servant well, who had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>The day following, he went into a city called Nain, accompanied by his disciples, and a great crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>As he approached the gate of the city, the people were carrying out a dead man, the only son of his mother, who was a widow; and many of the citizens were with her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>Then he who had been dead, sat up, and began to speak, and he delivered him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And all present were struck with awe, and glorified God, saying, A great prophet has arisen among us; and God has visited his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report, concerning him, spread throughout Judea, and all the neighboring country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>Now John's disciples had informed him of all these things,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>Being come to him, they said, John the Immerser has sent us to ask you, Are you He who comes, or must we expect another?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>At that very time Jesus was delivering man from diseases and maladies, and evil spirits, and giving sight to many, who were blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And he returned this answer, Go, and report to John what you have seen and heard: the blind are made to see, the lame to walk, the deaf to hear; the leprous are cleansed, the dead are raised, glad tidings are brought to the poor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>To what shall I compare the men of this generation? Whom are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children in the market place, of whom their companions complain, and say, We have played to you upon the pipe, but you have not danced; we have sung mournful songs to you, but you have not wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Immerser is come, abstaining from bread and wine, an associate of publicans and sinners; and you say, He has a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man is come, using both; and you say, He is a lover of banquets, and wine, an associate of publicans and sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>But wisdom is justified by all her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>Now one of the Pharisees asked Jesus to eat with him: and he went into the Pharisee's house, and placed himself at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman of the city who was a sinner, knowing that he eat at the house of the Pharisee, brought an alabaster box of balsam,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and standing behind at his feet weeping, bathed them with tears, and wiped them with the hairs of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with the balsam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>The Pharisee, who had invited him, observing this, said within himself, If this man were a prophet, he would have known who this woman is that touches him, and of what character, for she is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>Then Jesus said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. He answered, Say it, Rabbi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>A certain creditor had two debtors; one owed five hundred denarii, the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>But not having the means to pay, he freely forgave them both. Say, then, which of them will love him most?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered, I suppose he whom he forgave most? Jesus replied, You have judged right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Then turning to the woman, he said, Simon, Do you see this woman? When I came to your house, you gave me no water for my feet; but she has washed my feet with tears, and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You gave me no kiss; but she, since she entered, has not ceased kissing my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint my head with oil; but she has anointed my feet with balsam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>Wherefore, I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven; therefore, her love is great. But he to whom little is forgiven, has little love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>Then he said to her, Your sins are forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>Those, who were at table with him, said within themselves, Who is this, that even forgives sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>But he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you, go in peace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Afterward he traveled through cities and villages, proclaiming the joyful tidings of the Reign of God, being attended by the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and by certain women, who had been delivered from evil spirits and distempers; Mary, called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>Joanna, wife of Chuza, Herod's steward; Susanna, and several others, who assisted him with their property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>Now, when a great multitude was assembled, and the people were flocking to him, out of the cities, he spoke by a parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>The sower went out to sow his grain: and in sowing, part fell by the way-side, and was crushed under foot, or picked up by the birds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>part fell upon a rock, and when it was sprung up, withered away for want to moisture;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>part of it also fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>and part fell into good soil, and sprung up, and yielded increase, a hundred fold. Having said this, he cried, Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, saying, What does this parable mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>He answered, It is your privilege to know the secrets of the Reign of God, which, to others, are couched in parables; that, though they look, they may not perceive; that though they hear, they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now, this is the meaning of the parable. The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>By the wayside are meant those hearers out of whose hearts the devil coming, takes away the word, these they should believe, and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>By the rock are meant those, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; yet not having it rooted in them, are but temporary believers; for in the time of trial they fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>By the ground encumbered with thorns, are meant those hearers who are entangled in the business, and pursuits, and pleasures of life; which stifle the word, so that it brings no fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But by the good soil are meant those, who, having heard the word, retain it in a good and honest heart, and persevere in bringing forth fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>A lamp is never lighted to be covered with a vessel, or put under a bed; but to be set on a stand, that they who enter may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For there is no secret which shall not be discovered; nor anything concealed which shall not be known, and become public.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Take heard, therefore, how you hear; for to him who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, shall be taken even that which he seems to have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Then his mother and brothers came to speak with him; but could not get near him for the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was told him by some persons, Your mother and your brothers are without, desiring to see you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he, answering, said to them, My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God, and obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>One day, Jesus having gone into a bark with his disciples, said to them, Let us cross the lake. Accordingly they set sail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But while they sailed, he fell asleep; and there blew such a storm upon the lake, as filled the bark with water, and endangered lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came to him, and awakened him, saying, Master, Master, we perish! Then he arose and rebuked the wind, and the raging of the water: and they ceased, and there was a calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And Jesus said to them, Where is your faith? But they said one to another, with fear and admiration, Who is this that commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they arrived at the country of the Gadarenes, which is opposite to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>Being come ashore, a man of the city met him, who had been long possessed by demons; and who wore no clothes, and had no habitation but the sepulchers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus, he roared out, and threw himself at his feet, crying, What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beseech you, do not torment me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>(For he had ordered the unclean spirit to come out of the man; for it had frequently seized him, so that when he was chained and fettered, he broke his bonds, and was driven by the fiend into the desert.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>«Then Jesus asked him, saying, What is your names? He answered, Legion; because many demons had entered into him.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they entreated him, that he would not command them to go into the deep;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>but, as there was a numerous herd of swine feeding on the mountain, that he would permit them to enter into the swine. And he permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then the demons having quitted the man, entered into the swine; and the herd rushed down a precipice into the lake, and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>The herdsmen, seeing this, fled, and spread the news through the city and villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And the inhabitants flocked out to see what had happened. Being come to Jesus, and finding the man of whom the demons were dispossessed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind, they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>But having been informed by the spectators, in what manner the demoniac delivered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>all the people of the country of the Gadarenes, entreated him to leave them; for they were struck with terror. Accordingly, he re-entered the bark, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now, the man out of whom the demons were gone, entreated his permission to attend him. But Jesus dismissed him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return home, and relate what great things God has done for you. Then he departed, and published through all the city, what great things Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>Jesus, at his return, was welcomed by the crowd, who were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>Meantime, a man named Jairus, came, a ruler of the synagogue, who, throwing himself at the feet of Jesus, besought him to come into his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter, about twelve years old, who was dying. As Jesus went along, the people crowded him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>and a woman, who had been twelve years afflicted with an issue of blood, and had consumed all her living upon physicians, none of whom could cure her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>coming behind, touched the tuft of his mantle; upon which her issue was stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>Then Jesus said, Who touched me? When every body denied it, Peter, and those with him, answered, Master, the multitude throng and press you, and do you say, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>Jesus replied, Some person has touched me; for I am sensible that my power was just now exerted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>Then the woman perceiving that she was discovered, came trembling, and having thrown herself prostrate, declared to him, before all the people, why she had touched him, and how she had been immediately healed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>and he said to her, Daughter, take courage, your faith has cured you, go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was yet speaking, one came from the house of the director of the synagogue, who said, your daughter is dead; trouble not the Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>Jesus, hearing this, said to Jairus, Fear not; only believe, and she shall be well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>Being come to the house, he allowed no person to enter with him, except Peter, and John, and James, and the maid's father and mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And all wept, and lamented her. But he said, Weep not; she is not dead, but asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they derided him, knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he, having made them all retire, took her by the hand, and called, saying, Maiden, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she arose immediately, and he commanded to give her food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were astonished, but he charged them not to mention to any person what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>Jesus, having convened the twelve, gave them power and authority over all the demons, and to cure diseases;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>and sent them to proclaim the Reign of God, and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them, Provide nothing for your journey; nor staves, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver, nor two coats apiece;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>and continue in whatever house you are received into, till you leave the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And wheresoever they will not receive you, shake even the dust off your feet, as a protestation against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>They accordingly departed, and traveled through the villages, publishing the good tidings, and performing cures everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod, the tetrarch, having heard of all that Jesus had done, was perplexed; because some said, John is risen from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and some, Elijah has appeared; and others, One of the ancient prophets is risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, John I beheaded; but who is this, of whom I hear such things? And he was desirous to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>Now, the Apostles having returned, reported to Jesus all that they had done: and he, taking them with him, retired privately to a desert belonging to the city of Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the multitude, having known it, followed him; and he, receiving them, spoke to them concerning the Reign of God; and he healed those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>When the day began to decline, the twelve, accosting him, said, Dismiss the people, that they may go to the nearest towns and villages, and provide themselves lodging and food; for we are in a desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>He answered, Supply them yourselves with food. They replied, We have only five loaves and two fishes; unless we go and buy victuals for all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For they were about five thousand men. Then he said to his disciples, Make them recline in parties; fifty in a party.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, making them all recline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>Then he took the five loaves and the two fishes; and looking up to heaven, he blessed and broke them, and gave them to his disciples, to set before the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>And they all did eat and were satisfied; and took up twelve baskets full of fragments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>Afterward, Jesus having withdrawn from the multitude to pray, apart with his disciples, asked them, saying, Who do people say that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>They answered, John the Immerser; others say, Elijah; and others, that one of the ancient prophets is risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered, The Messiah of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>Then, having strictly charged them, he prohibited them from telling this to any person;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>adding, The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and rise again the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>Moreover, he said to all the people, If any man will come under my guidance, let him renounce himself, and take his cross daily, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whosoever would save his life, shall lose it; and whosoever will lose his life for my sake, shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>What will it profit a man to gain the whole world, with the forfeit or ruin of himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whosoever shall be ashamed of me, and of my words, of him will the Son of Man be ashamed, when he shall come in his own glory, and in that of the Father, and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>I assure you, that there are some standing here, who shall not taste death till they see the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>About eight days after this discourse, he took with him Peter, and John, and James, and went up on a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>While he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was changed, and his raiment contracted a dazzling whiteness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And, behold, two men of a glorious aspect, Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>conversed with him, and spoke of the departure which he was to accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now, Peter, and those that were with him, were overpowered with sleep; but when they awoke, they saw his glory, and the two men who stood with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>As these were removing from Jesus, Peter said to him, not knowing what he said, Master, it is good for us to stay here; let us, then, make three booths, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he was speaking, a cloud came and covered them, and the disciples feared, when they entered the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>From the cloud a voice came, which said, This is my Son, the beloved; hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>While the voice was uttered, Jesus was found alone. And they kept secret, telling no person, in those days, anything of what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>The next day, when they were come down from the mountain, a great multitude met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And one of the crowd cried out, saying, Rabbi, I beseech you, take pity on my son; for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And lo! a spirit seizes him, making him instantly cry out, and fall into convulsions, so that he foams; and after he is much bruised, hardly leaves him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I besought your disciples to expel the demon; but they were not able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Then, Jesus answering, said, O incredulous and perverse generation! how long shall I be with you, and suffer you? Bring your son hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was coming, the demon dashed him down in convulsions. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and having cured the child, delivered him to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the great power of God. While all were admiring everything which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Mark diligently these words, the Son of Man is to be delivered into the hands of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they understood not this language; it was veiled to them, that they might not apprehend it; and they were afraid to ask him concerning it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>And there arose a debate among them, which of them should be the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus, who perceived the thought of their heart, took a child, and placing him near himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>said to them, Whosoever shall receive this child for my sake, receives me; and whosoever shall receive me, receives him who sent me: for he who is the least amongst you all, this person shall be great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>Then John replied, Master, we saw one expelling demons in your name, and we forbade him, because he consorts not with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>Jesus answered, Forbid not such; for whosoever is not against us, is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>Now, as the time of his departure approached, he set out resolutely for Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and sent messengers before, who went into a village of the Samaritans to make preparation for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>But they would not admit him; because they perceived he was going to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>His disciples, James and John, observing this, said, Master, shall we call down fire from heaven to consume them, as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and rebuked them, saying, Do you not know of what spirit you are?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>As they were on the way, one said to him, Master, I will follow you whithersoever you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jesus answered, The foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have places of shelter; but the Son of Man has not where to repose his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>He said to another, Follow me. He answered, Sir, permit me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus replied, Let the dead bury their dead; but go you and publish the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>Another, likewise, said, I will follow you, Sir; but first permit me to take leave of my family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>Jesus answered, No man, having put his hand to the plow, looks behind him, is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.41'>Jesus answering, said to her, Martha, Martha, you are anxious, and trouble yourself about many things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.13.17'>On his saying this, all his opposers were ashamed; but the whole multitude was delighted with all the glorious actions performed by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.18'>He said, moreover, What does the kingdom of God resemble? To what shall I compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.19'>It resembles a grain of mustard seed, which a man threw into his garden; and it grew, and became a great tree, and the birds of the air took shelter in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.20'>Again, he said, To what shall I compare the kingdom of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.21'>It resembles leaven, which a woman mingled in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.22'>And he took a journey to Jerusalem; teaching as he passed through cities and villages:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.23'>and one asked him, Master, are there but few who shall be saved? He answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.24'>Force your entrance through the straight gate; for many, I assure you, will request to be admitted, who shall not prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.25'>If once the master of the house shall have arisen and locked the door, and you standing without and knocking, say, Master, Master, open to us; he will answer, I know not whence you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.26'>Then they will say, We have eat and drunk with you, and you have taught in our streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.27'>But he will answer, I tell you, I know not whence you are: remove hence, all you workers of unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.13.28'>Then will ensue weeping, and gnashing of teeth, when you shall see Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob, and all the prophets received into the kingdom of God, and yourselves excluded:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.13.31'>The same day, certain Pharisees came to him, and said, Get away; depart hence, for Herod intends to kill you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.14'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.1'>It happened on a Sabbath, when he was gone to eat at the house of one of the rulers, who was a Pharisee, that while the Pharisees were observing him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.2'>a man who had a dropsy stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.3'>Then Jesus addressing himself to the lawyers and Pharisees, said, Is it lawful to cure on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.4'>They being silent, he took hold of the man, healed and dismissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.5'>Then resuming his discourse, he said to them, Who, amongst you, if his ass or his ox fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will not immediately pull him out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.6'>And to this they were not able to make him a reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.7'>Observing how eager the guests were to possess the higher places at the table, he gave them this injunction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.8'>When you are invited to a wedding, do not occupy the highest place at table, lest one more considerable than you be bidden,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.9'>and he who invited you both, come and say to you, Give place to this man; and you should then rise with confusion, to take the lowest place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.10'>But when you are invited, go to the lowest place, that when he who invited you comes, he may say to you, Friend, go up higher; for that will do you honor before the company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.11'>For whoever exalts himself, shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself, shall be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.12'>He said also to him who had invited him, When you give a dinner, or a supper, do not invited your rich friends, brothers, cousins, or neighbors, lest they also invite you, in their turn, and you be recompensed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.13'>But when you give an entertainment, invite the poor, the maimed, the lame, the blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.14'>and you shall be happy; for, as they have not the means to requite you, you shall be requited at the resurrection of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.15'>One of the guests, hearing this, said to him, Happy be he who shall feast in the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.16'>Jesus said to him, A certain man made a great supper, and invited many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.17'>And at supper time he sent his servants, to tell those who had been invited to come presently; for, that all was ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.18'>But they all, without exception, made excuses. One said, I have purchased a field, which I must go and see; I pray you have me excused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.19'>Another said, I have bought five yoke of oxen, which I am going to prove; I pray you have me excused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.20'>A third said, I have married a wife; and, therefore, I can not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.21'>The servant being returned, related all to his master. Then the master of the house was angry, and said to his servants, Go immediately into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor, the maimed, the lame, and the blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.22'>Afterward, the servant said, Sir, your orders are executed, and still there is room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.23'>The master answered, Go out into the highways, and along the hedges, and compel people to come, that my house may be filled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.24'>for I declare to you, that none of those who were invited, shall taste of my supper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.25'>As great multitudes traveled along with him, he turned to them, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.26'>If any man come to me, and hate not his father and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and sisters; nay, and himself, too; he can not be my disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.27'>And whosoever does not follow me, carrying his cross, can not be my disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.28'>For which of you, intending to build a tower, does not first, by himself, compute the expense, to know whether he have the means to complete it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.29'>lest, having laid the foundation, and being unable to finish, he become the derision of all who see it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.30'>who will say, This man began to build, but was not able to finish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.31'>Or what king, going to engage another king, with whom he is at war, does not first consult, by himself, whether he can, with ten thousand men, encounter him who comes against him with twenty thousand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.32'>that if he can not, he may, while the other is at a distance, send an embassy to sue for peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.33'>So then, whosoever he be of you, who does not renounce all that he has, he can not be my disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.34'>Salt is good; but if the salt become insipid, with what shall it be seasoned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.35'>It is fit neither for the land, nor for the dunghill, but is thrown away. Whosoever has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.15'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.1'>Now, all the publicans and the sinners resorted to Jesus, to hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.2'>But the Pharisees and the Scribes murmured, saying, This man admits sinners, and eats with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.3'>Then he addressed this similitude to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.4'>What man, amongst you, who has a hundred sheep, if he lose one of them, does not leave the ninety-nine in the desert, to go after that which is lost, till he find it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.5'>And having found it, does he not joyfully lay it on his shoulders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.6'>and when he is come home, convene his friends and neighbors, saying to them, Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.7'>Thus, I assure you, there is greater joy in heaven for one sinner who reforms, than for ninety-nine righteous persons, who need no reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.8'>Or what woman, who has ten drachmas, if she lose one, does not light a lamp, and sweep the house, and search carefully till she find it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.9'>And having found it, does she not assemble her female friends and neighbors, saying, Rejoice with me, for I have found the drachma which I had lost!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.10'>Such joy, I assure you, have the angels of God, when any sinner reforms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.11'>He said, also, A certain man had two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.12'>and the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me my portion of the estate. And he allotted to them their shares.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.13'>Soon after, the younger son gathered all together, and traveled into a distant country, and there wasted his substance in riot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.14'>When all was spent, a great famine came upon that land, and he began to be in want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.15'>Then he applied to one of the inhabitants of the country, who sent him into his fields to keep swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.16'>And he desired to appease his hunger with the husks on which the swine were feeding; for no person gave him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.17'>At length, coming to himself, he said, How many hirelings has my father, who have all more bread than suffices them, while I perish with hunger!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.18'>I will arise, and go to my father, and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.19'>and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.20'>And he arose, and went to his father. When he was yet afar off, his father saw him, and had compassion, and ran, and threw himself upon his neck, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.21'>And the son said, Father, I have sinned against heaven and you, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.22'>But the father said to his servants, Bring here the principal robe, and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger, and shoes on his feet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.23'>bring also the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat, and be merry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.24'>for this, my son, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. So they began to be merry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.25'>Now his elder son was in the field, walking home. And as he drew near the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.26'>He, therefore, called one of the servants, and asked the reason of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.27'>He answered, Your brother is returned, and your father has killed the fatted calf, because he has received him in health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.28'>And he was angry, and would not go in; therefore, his father came out, and entreated him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.29'>He answering, said to his father, These many years I have served you, without disobeying your command in anything; yet you never gave me a kid, that I might entertain my friends;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.30'>but no sooner did this, your son, return, who had squandered your living on prostitutes, than you killed for him the fatted calf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.31'>Son, replied the father, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.32'>it was but reasonable that we should rejoice and be merry; because this, your brother, was dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.16'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.1'>He said, likewise, to his disciples, A certain rich man had a steward, who was accused to him of wasting his estate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.2'>Having, therefore, called him, he said, What is this that I hear of you? Render an account of your management, for you shall be steward no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.3'>And the steward said within himself, What shall I do? My master takes from me the stewardship; I can not dig, and am ashamed to beg.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.4'>I am resolved what to do, that when I am discarded, there may be some who will receive me into their houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.5'>Having, therefore, sent severally for all his master's debtors, he asked one, How much do you owe my master?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.6'>He answered, A hundred baths of oil. Take back your bill, said the steward, sit down directly, and write fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.7'>Then he asked another, How much do you owe? He answered, A hundred homers of wheat. Take back your bill, said he, and write eighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.8'>The master commended the prudence of the unjust steward; for the children of this world are more prudent in conducting their affairs, than the children of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.9'>Therefore, I say to you, with the deceitful riches procure to yourself friends, who, after your discharge, may receive you into the eternal mansion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.10'>Whoso is faithful in little is faithful also in much: and whoso is unjust in little, is unjust also in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.11'>If, therefore, you have not been honest in the deceitful, who will entrust you with the true riches?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.12'>And if you have been unfaithful managers for another, who will give you anything to manage for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.13'>A servant can not serve two masters: for either he will hate one, and love the other; or, at least, will attend one, and neglect the other. You can not serve God and mammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.14'>When the Pharisees, who loved money, heard all these things, they ridiculed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.15'>But he said to them, As for you, you make yourselves pass upon men for righteous, but God knows your hearts; for that which is admired of men is abhorred of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.16'>You had the law and the prophets till the coming of John, since whose time, the kingdom of God is announced, and every occupant enters it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.17'>But sooner shall heaven and earth perish, than one tittle of the law shall fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.18'>Whoever divorces his wife, and takes another, commits adultery; and whoever marries the divorced woman, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.19'>There was a certain rich man, that wore purple and fine linen, and feasted splendidly every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.20'>There was also a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, that was laid at his gate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.21'>and who was desirous to feed on the crumbs which fell from the rich man's table: yes, even the dogs came and licked his sores.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.22'>It happened that the poor man died, and was conveyed by angels to Abraham's bosom: the rich man also died, and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.23'>And in hades, being in torments, he looked up, and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.24'>and cried, saying, Have pity on me, father Abraham, and send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water, and cool my tongue; for I am tortured in this flame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.25'>Abraham answered, Son, remember that you, in your lifetime, received good things, and Lazarus received evil things; but now he is in joy, and you are in torments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.26'>Besides, there lies a huge gulf between us and you, so that they who would pass hence to you, can not: neither can they pass to us, who would come thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.27'>The other replied, I entreat you, then, father, to send him to my father's house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.28'>for I have five brothers, that he may admonish them, lest they also come into this place of torment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.29'>Abraham answered, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.30'>Nay, said he, father Abraham, but if one went to them from the dead, they would reform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.31'>Abraham replied, if they hear not Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded though one should arise from the dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.17.1'>Then Jesus said to his disciples, It is impossible to exclude snares entirely; but, alas, for him who ensnares!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.17.2'>It would be more eligible for him to have an upper millstone fastened to his neck, and to be cast into the sea, than to ensnare one of these little ones.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>In a certain city, said he, there was a judge, who neither feared God nor regarded man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>And there was a widow in that city, who came to him, saying, Do me justice on my adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>For some time he refused; be afterward he argued thus with himself, Although I neither fear God, nor regard man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.5'>yet, because this widow importunes me, I will judge her cause; let she come perpetually, and plague me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>Mark, said the Lord, what the unjust judge determined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And will not God avenge his elect, who cry to him day and night? Will he linger in their cause?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I assure you, he will suddenly avenge them. Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, will he find this belief upon the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>Then addressing some who were conceited of themselves, as being righteous, and despised others, he proposed this example:-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>Two men went up to the temple to pray; one a Pharisee, the other a publican.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee standing by himself, prayed thus: -O God, I thank thee that I am not as other men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this publican.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a-week. I give tithes of all that I possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>But the publican, standing at a distance, and not daring so much as to lift up his eyes to heaven, smote his breast, and cried, God, be merciful to me a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I assure you, that this man returned home more approved than the other: for whoever exalts himself, shall be humbled; but whoever humbles himself, shall be exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>Then they presented babes to him, that he might touch them: the disciples observing it, rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus calling them to him, said, Permit the children to come to me, and do not forbid them; for of such is the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>Indeed, I say to you, whoever will not receive the kingdom of God as a child, shall never enter it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>Then a certain ruler asked him, saying, Good Teacher, what good shall I do to obtain eternal life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>Jesus answered, Why do you call me good? God alone is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the commandments: Do not commit adultery; do not commit murder; do not steal; do not give false testimony; honor your father and your mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>He replied, All these I have observed from my childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>Hearing this, Jesus said to him, Yet in one thing you are deficient: sell all that you have, and distribute to the poor, and you shall have treasure in heaven: then come and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>When he heard this, he was exceedingly sorrowful; for he was very rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>Jesus, perceiving that he was very sorrowful, said, How difficult will it be for men of opulence to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>It is easier for a camel to pass through a needle's eye than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>«The hearers said, Who, then, can be saved?»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>Jesus answered, Things impossible to men, are possible to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>Then Peter said, Lo! we have forsaken all, and followed thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, that there is none who shall have forsaken his house, or parents, or brothers, or wife, or children, on account of the kingdom of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>who shall not receive manifold more in return, in this world, and in the future, eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>Then Jesus, taking the twelve aside, said to them, We are now going to Jerusalem, where that all the prophets have written, shall be accomplished on the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and ridicules, and insulted, and spitted on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>And after scourging, they will kill him; and he shall rise again the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>But they understood none of these things: this discourse was dark to them; they did not comprehend its meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>When he came near to Jericho, a blind man who sat by the way-side begging,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>hearing the crowd pass by, inquired what was the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>And being told that Jesus the Nazarene was passing by,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>he immediately cried, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>They who went before, charged him to be silent; but he cried the louder, saying, Jesus, Son of David, have pity on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>Jesus stopped, and commanded them to bring the man to him. And when he was nigh, he asked him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>What do you wish me to do for you? He answered, Master, to give me my sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>And Jesus said to him, Receive your sight; your faith has cured you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>Instantly he received his sight, and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people saw it, and praised God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>When Jesus had entered, and was passing through Jericho,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>behold, a man named Zaccheus, a rich man, and chief of the publicans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>endeavored to see what sort of person he was, but could not for the press, being of a low stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>Therefore, running before, he climbed up into a sycamore, to see him; having observed that he was going that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>When Jesus came to the place, he looked up, and seeing him, said, Zaccheus, make haste and come down, for today I must abide at your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>And he made haste, and came down, and received him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>When the multitude perceived this, they said, murmuring, He is gone to be entertained by a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>But Zaccheus, presenting himself before Jesus, said, Master, half of my goods I will give to the poor; and if in anything I have wronged any man, I will restore fourfold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said, concerning him, Today is salvation come to this house; inasmuch as he also is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>For the Son of Man is come to seek and recover that which was lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>As the people were attentive, he added this parable, because he was nigh to Jerusalem, and they fancied the Reign of God would immediately commence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>A certain nobleman went abroad to procure for himself the royalty, and then return;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>and having called ten of his servants, and delivered to them ten pounds, he said, improve these till I return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>Now his citizens hated him; and sending an embassy after him, protested, We will not have this man for our king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>When he returned, vested with royal power, he commanded those servants to be called to whom he had committed the money, that he might know what every one had gained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>Then the first came, and said, My Lord, your pound has gained ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>He answered, Well done, good servant; because you have been faithful in a very small matter, receive the government of ten cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second who came, said, My Lord, your pound has gained five pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>He answered, Be you also governor of five cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>Another came, saying, My Lord, here is your pound, which I have kept laid up in a napkin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>for I was afraid of you, because you are a hard master; you exact what you did not give, and reap what you did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>He answered, Out of your own mouth, you malignant servant, I will condemn you. Did you know that I am a hard master, exacting what I did not give, and reaping what I did not sow?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why, then, did you not put my money into the bank; that at my return I might have received it with interest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>Then he said to his attendants, Take the pound from him, and give it to him who has ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>They answered, My Lord, he has ten pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>He replied, I tell you, that to every one who has, more shall be given; but from him who has not, even that which he has shall be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But as for those my enemies, who would not have me for their king, bring them hither, and slay them in my presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>After this discourse, Jesus walked foremost, traveling toward Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>When he approached Bethphage and Bethany, near the mountain called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, Go to yonder village, where, as you enter, you will find a colt tied, on which no man ever rode; loose him, and bring him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>If any one ask you why you loose him, you shall answer, Because the Master needs him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>Accordingly, they who received this order, went, and found everything as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>As they were loosing the colt, the owners said to them, Why loose you the colt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>They answered, The Master needs him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>So they brought him to Jesus, and having thrown their mantles upon the colt, set Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>As he went, the people spread their mantles in the way before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>When he was so near as the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God in loud acclamations, for all the miracles which they had seen;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying, Blessed be the King who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>Upon this, some Pharisees in the crowd said to him, Rabbi, rebuke your disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>He answered, I tell you, that if these were silent, the stones would cry out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>When he came near, and beheld the city, he wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, O that thou hadst known, at least in this thy day, the things which concern thy peace! But now they are hid from thine eyes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>for the days are coming upon thee, when thine enemies will surround thee with a rampart, and inclose thee, and shut thee up on every side;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>and will level thee with the ground, thee and thy children, and will not leave one stone upon another, because thou didst not know the time when thou wast visited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>Afterward he went into the temple, and drove out thence those who sold, and those who bought in it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>«saying to them, It is written,'My house is a house of prayer, but you have made it a den of robbers.'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And he taught daily in the temple, while the chief priests and the scribes, and persons of principal note, sought his destruction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>but could not devise how to effect it: for all the people heard him with the greatest attention.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>One of those days, as he was teaching the people in the temple, and publishing the good tidings, the chief priests, and the scribes, with the elders, came upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>saying, Tell us by what authority you do these things; or who is he that empowered you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>He answering, said to them, I also have a question to put to you. Tell me, then,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>Was the commission which John had to immerse, from heaven, or from men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>But they reasoned thus among themselves, If we say, From heaven, he will reply, Why, then, did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>And if we say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>They therefore answered, that they could not tell whence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>Jesus replied, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then he spoke to the people this parable: A man planted a vineyard, and farmed it out, and having traveled, continued long abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>The season being come, he sent a servant to the husbandmen, to receive of the produce of the vineyard; but they beat him, and sent him back empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>Afterward, he sent another servant, whom they, having beaten, and used shamefully, also sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>He afterward dispatched a third to them. Him, likewise, they wounded and drove away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the proprietor of the vineyard said, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son; they will surely reverence him, when they see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when then husbandmen saw him, they reasoned thus among themselves, This is the heir, come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be our own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And having thrust him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What, therefore, will the proprietor of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and give the vineyard to others. And some of his hearers said, God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>«Jesus, looking on them, said, What, then, means that expression of scripture,» 'A stone which the builders rejected, is made the head of the corner.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>«Whosoever shall fall upon that stone, shall be bruised; but on whomsoever it shall fall, it will crush him to pieces?»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>At that time, the chief priests and the scribes, knowing that he had spoken this parable against them, would have laid hands on him, but feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they watched him, and set spies upon him, instructing them to personate conscientious men, and surprise him in his words, that they might deliver him to the power and authority of the procurator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>These accosted him with this question, Rabbi, we know that you speak and teach uprightly, and that, without respect of persons, you faithfully recommend the way of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Cesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>He perceiving their subtlety, answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Why would you entangle me? Show me a denarius. Whose image and inscription has it? They answered, Cesar's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>He replied, Render, therefore, to Cesar, that which is Cesar's, and to God, that which is God's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>Thus they could not surprise him in his discourses before the people; wherefore, admiring his answer, they kept silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Afterward, some of the Sadducees, who deny a future state, came to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>with this question: Rabbi, Moses has enjoined in his writings, that a man whose brother dies childless, outlived by his wife, shall marry the widow, and raise issue to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers; the first of whom, having taken a wife, died childless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>the second married the widow, and also died childless;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>the third married her, as did likewise the rest; and all seven died, leaving no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all, the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>To which of them, therefore, will she be wife, at the resurrection; for she had been married to all the seven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>Jesus answering, said to them, The people of this world marry, and are given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but, among them who shall be honored to share in the resurrection, and the other world, there will be neither marrying nor giving in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for they can not die any more; because, like the angels, they are children of God, being children of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses has suggested, calling the Lord who appeared in the bush, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Now he is not a God of the dead, but of the living; for they are all alive to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then some of the scribes said to him, Rabbi, you have spoken well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>After that, they did not venture to ask him any more questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said to them, Why is it affirmed that the Messiah must be a son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>«Yet David himself says, in the book of the Psalms,» 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>«till I make thy foes thy footstool.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>As David thus calls him his Lord, how can he be David's son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then, in the audience of all the people, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, who love to walk in robes, and affect salutations in public places, and the principal seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost places at feasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour the families of widows, and make long prayers for a disguise. These shall suffer the severest punishment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>As Jesus was observing the rich casting their gifts into the treasury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>he saw an indigent widow throw in two mites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>And he said, I tell you, truly, that this poor widow has cast in more than any of them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>for all of these, out of their superfluous store, have thrown into the sacred chest, she has thrown in all the little that she had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>Some having remarked, that the temple was adorned with beautiful stones and presents, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>The time will come, when these things which you behold, shall be razed that one stone will not be left upon another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>Then they asked him, saying, Rabbi, when will these things be: and what will be the sign, when they are about to be accomplished?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>He answered, Take care that you be not seduced: for many will assume my character, saying, I am the person, and the time approaches; therefore, do not follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>But when you shall hear of wars and insurrections, be not terrified: for these things must first happen; but the end will not immediately follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>He added, Then will nation rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>And there shall be great earthquakes in sundry places, and famines, and pestilences; there shall be also frightful appearances, and great prodigies in the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.12'>But, before all this, you shall be apprehended and prosecuted, and delivered to synagogues, and imprisoned, and dragged before kings and governors, because of my name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.13'>and this afford scope for your testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.14'>Be, therefore, resolved not to premeditate what defense you shall make;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.15'>for I will give you an utterance, and wisdom, which none of your adversaries shall be able to refute or resist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.16'>And you shall be given up even by parents, and brothers, and kinsmen, and friends; and some of you will be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.17'>And, on my account, you shall be universally hated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.18'>Yet not a hair of your head shall be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.19'>Save your souls by your perseverance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.20'>Now, when you shall see Jerusalem invested with armies, know that its desolation is nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.21'>Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains; let those in the city make their escape, and let not those in the country enter the city:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.22'>for these will be days of vengeance, in which all the denunciations of the scriptures shall be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.23'>But, alas, for the women with child, and for them who give suck in those days! for there shall be great distress in the land, and wrath upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.24'>They shall fall by the sword; they shall be carried captive into all nations; and Jerusalem shall be trodden by the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.25'>And there shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars; and upon the earth, the anguish of desponding nations; and roarings in the seas, and floods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.26'>men expiring with the fear and apprehension of those things which are coming upon the world; for the powers of heaven shall be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.27'>Then they shall see the Son of Man coming in a cloud with great glory and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.28'>Now when these things begin to be fulfilled, look up, and lift up your heads; because your deliverance approaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.29'>He proposed to them, also, this comparison: Consider the fig tree, and the other trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.30'>When you observe them shooting forth, you know, of yourselves, that the summer is nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.31'>Know, in like manner, when you shall see these events, that the Reign of God is nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.32'>Indeed, I say to you, that this race shall not fail until all be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.33'>Heaven and earth shall fail; but my words shall not fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.34'>Take heed, therefore, to yourselves, lest your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and worldly cares, and that day come upon you unawares: for, as a net,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.35'>it shall inclose all the inhabitants of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.36'>Be vigilant, therefore, praying on every occasion, that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these approaching evils, and to stand before the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.37'>Thus Jesus taught in the temple by day, but retired at night to the mountain, called the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.38'>And every morning the people resorted early to the temple to hear him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Now the feast of unleavened bread, called the passover, being near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>the chief priests and the scribes sought how they might kill him, for they feared the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Then Satan entered into Judas, surnamed Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>And he went and concerted with the chief priests and officers, how he might deliver Jesus into their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad, and agreed to give him a certain sum,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>which Judas having accepted, watched an opportunity to deliver him up without tumult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Now, this day of unleavened bread being come, on which the passover must be sacrificed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, Go and prepare for us the passover, that we may eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>They asked him, Where shall we prepare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He answered, When you enter the city, you will meet a man carrying a pitcher of water; follow him into the house which he shall enter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>and say to the master of the house, The Teacher asks you, Where is the guest-chamber, where I may eat the passover with my disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>And he will show you a large upper room, furnished; make ready there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went, and having found everything as he had told them, prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>When the hour was come, he placed himself at table with the twelve Apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>and said to them, Much have I longed to eat this passover with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>that I will never partake of another, until it be accomplished in the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>Then, taking a cup, he gave thanks, and said, Take this, and share it amongst you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>for I assure you, that I will not again drink of the product of the vine, until the Reign of God be come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>Then he took bread, and having given thanks, broke it, and gave it to them, saying, This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in commemoration of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>He likewise gave the cup, after supper, saying, This cup is the new Institution in my blood, which is shed for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>Mark, however, that the hand of him who betrays me, is on the table with mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>The Son of Man is going away, as has been determined: nevertheless, alas, for that man by whom he is betrayed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>Then they began to inquire among themselves, which of them it could be that would do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>There had been, also, a contention amongst them, which of them should be accounted the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>And he said to them, The king of the nations exercise dominion over them; and they who oppress them, are styled benefactors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But with you, it must be otherwise: nay, let the greatest amongst you be as the least; and him who governs, as he who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For, which is greater, he who is at table, or he who serves? Is not he that is at table? Yet I am amongst you as one who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You are they who have continued with me in my trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I grant to you, (forasmuch as my Father has granted me a kingdom,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>to eat, and to drink at my table, in my kingdom, and to sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>The Lord said, also, Simon, Simon, Satan has obtained permission to sift you as wheat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not; do you, therefore, when you have recovered yourself, confirm your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>He answered, Master, I am ready to accompany you, both to prison, and to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Jesus replied, I tell you, Peter, the cock shall not crow today, before you have thrice denied that you know me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>Then he said to them, When I sent you without purse, and bag, and shoes, did you want anything?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>But now, said he, let him that has a purse, take it, and likewise his bag; and let him who has no sword, sell his mantle, and buy one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>«for I tell you that this scripture,» 'He was ranked among malefactors,' 'is now to be accomplished in me: for the things relating to me must be fulfilled.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>They said, Master, here are two swords. He replied, It is enough.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>Then he went out, and repaired, as he was wont, to the Mount of Olives, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>Being arrived there, he said to them, Pray that you may not yield to temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>Then, being withdrawn from them about a stone's cast; he kneeled down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>saying, Father, if thou wilt, take this cup away from me; nevertheless, not my will, but thine be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in an agony of grief, he prayed the more fervently, and his sweat fell like clotted blood to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>Having risen from prayer, and returned to the disciples, he found them sleeping, oppressed with grief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>and said to them, Why do you sleep? Arise, and pray, lest the trial overcome you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>Before he had done speaking, he saw a multitude; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, walked before them, and came up to Jesus, to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>Jesus said to him, Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>Now, those who were with him, foreseeing what would happen, said to him, Master, shall we strike with the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>Jesus said, Let this suffice; and touching his ear, he healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, and the officers of the temple-guard, and the elders, who were come to apprehend him, Do you come with swords and clubs, as in pursuit of a robber?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>While I was daily with you in the temple, you did not attempt to arrest me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>Then they seized him, and led him away to the high priest's house. And Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the court, and were sitting round it, Peter sat down among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>And a maid servant, having observed him sitting by the fire, and viewed him attentively, said, This man also was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he disowned him, saying, Woman, I know him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>A little while after, another seeing him, said, You, also, are one of them. Peter answered, Man, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>About an hour after, another averred the same thing, saying, This man was surely with him, for he is a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>Peter answered, Man, I know nothing of this matter. And just as he spoke the word, a cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>Then the Lord, turning, looked upon Peter, and Peter called to mind the word which the Lord had said to him, Before the cock crow, you will disown me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And he went out and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Meantime, they who had Jesus in charge, mocked and beat him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>and having blindfolded him, struck him on the face, and asked him, saying, Divine who it is that smote you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And many other abusive things they said against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>As soon as it was day, the national senate, with the chief priests and scribes, were assembled, and having caused him to be brought into their council-chamber, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>If you be the Messiah, tell us. He answered, If I tell you, you will not believe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>and if put a question, you will neither answer me, nor acquit me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>Hereafter the Son of Man shall be seated at the right hand of Almighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>They all replied, You are, then, the Son of God? He answered, You say the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>Then they cried, What further need have we of evidence? We have heard enough ourselves, from his own mouth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>And the assembly broke up, and conducted Jesus to Pilate:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>and they accused him, saying, We found this man perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Cesar, calling himself Messiah the King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate, asking him, said, You are the King of the Jews? He answered, You say right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Pilate said to the chief priests and the multitude, I find nothing criminal in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they became more vehement, adding, He raised sedition among the people, by the doctrine which he spread through all Judea, from Galilee, where he began, to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard them mention Galilee, he asked, whether the man were a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And finding that he belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who was also then at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>And Herod was very glad to see Jesus: it was what he had long desired; having heard much of him, and hoping to see him perform some miracle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>He, therefore, asked him many questions, but Jesus returned him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>Yet the chief priests and the scribes, who were present, accused him with eagerness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>But Herod and his military train despised him: and having, in derision, arrayed him in a splendid robe, remanded him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>On that day, Pilate and Herod became friends; for, before, they had been at enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Pilate, having convened the chief priests, the magistrates and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said to them, You have brought this man before me, as one who excites the people to revolt; yet, having examined him in your presence, I have not found him guilt of any of those crimes of which you accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>Neither has Herod; for I referred you to him. Be assured, then, that he has done nothing to deserve death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>For it was necessary that he should release one to them at the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>Then all cried out together, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>Now Barabbas had been imprisoned for raising sedition in the city, and for murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate, willing to release Jesus, again, expostulated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried, saying, Crucify! crucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>A third time he repeated, Why? What evil has this man done? I do not find him guilty of any capital crime; I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they persisted, demanding, with much clamor, that he might be crucified. At last, their clamors, and those of the chief priests, prevailed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>and Pilate pronounced sentence, that it should be as they desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>Accordingly, he released a man who had been imprisoned for sedition and murder; whom they required; and gave up Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>As they led him away, they laid hold of one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming from the country, and laid the cross on him, that he might bear it after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude followed him, amongst whom were many women, who lamented and bewailed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus, turning to them, said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>for the days are coming, in which they shall say, Happy the barren, the wombs which never bare, and the breasts which never gave suck!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they shall cry to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>for if it fare thus with the green tree, how shall it fare with the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And two malefactors were also led with him to execution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>When they came to the place called Calvary, they there nailed him to a cross, and the malefactors also; one at his right hand, the other at his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>And Jesus said, Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do. And they parted his garments by lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>While the people stood gazing, even their rulers joined them in ridiculing him, and saying, This man saved others; let him save himself, if he be the Messiah, the elect of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers likewise mocked him, coming and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, If you be the King of the Jews, save yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>There was also an inscription over his head in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>Now, one of the malefactors who suffered with him, reviled him, saying, If you be the Messiah, save yourself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>The other, rebuking him, answered, Have you no fear of God, you who are undergoing the same punishment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we, indeed, justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man has done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to Jesus, Remember me, Lord, when thou comest to thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>Jesus answered, Indeed, I say to you, Today you shall be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And, about the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the land, which lasted till the ninth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>The sun was darkened, and the vail of the temple was rent in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus said with a loud voice, Father, into thy hands I commit my spirit; and having thus said, he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Then, the centurion, observing what had happened, gave glory to God; saying, Assuredly, this was a righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>Nay, all the people who were present at this spectacle, and saw what had passed, returned, beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintance, and the women who had followed him from Galilee, standing at a distance, beheld these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>Now, there was a senator, named Joseph, a good and just man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>from Arimathea, a city of Judea, who had not concurred in the resolutions and proceedings of the rest; and who himself, also expected the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And having taken it down, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a tomb cut in stone, in which no man had ever been deposited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>Now that day was the preparation, and the Sabbath approached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women, who had accompanied Jesus from Galilee, followed Joseph, and observed the tomb, and how the body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>When they returned, they provided spices and ointments, and then rested the Sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But the first day of the week, they went by daybreak, with some others, to the tomb, carrying the spices which they had provided,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>and found the stone rolled away from the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and having entered, they found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>While they were in perplexity on this account, behold, two men stood by them, in robes of a dazzling brightness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>The women being affrighted, and fixing their eyes on the ground, these said to them, Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen; remember how he spoke to you, before he left Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying, The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinners, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>Then they remembered his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>On their return from the tomb, they reported the whole matter to the eleven, and to all the other disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary the Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women with them, who told these things to the Apostles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>but their account appeared to them as idle tales; they gave them no credit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>Peter, however, arose and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, saw nothing there but the linen lying. And he went away, musing with astonishment on what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>The same day, as two of the disciples were traveling to a village named Emmaus, sixty furlongs from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>they conversed together about all these events.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>While they were conversing and reasoning, Jesus himself joined them, and went along with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were so affected that they did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What subjects are these about which you confer together? and why are you dejected?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, named Cleopas, answered, Are you only a stranger in Jerusalem, and do you not know the things which have happened there so lately?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>What things? said he. They answered, Concerning Jesus, the Nazarene, who was a prophet, powerful in word and deed, before God and all the people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>how our chief priests and magistrates have delivered him to be condemned to death, and have crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>As for us, we trusted that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel. Besides all this, today, being the third day since these things happened,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>some women of our company have astonished us; for having gone early to the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and not found his body, they came and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who said that he is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of our men went to the tomb, and found matters exactly as the women had related; but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said to them, O thoughtless men, and backward to believe things which have been all predicted by the prophets!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not the Messiah thus to suffer, and so to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>Then beginning with Moses, and proceeding through all the prophets, he explained to them all the passages relating to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>When they came near the village, whither they were traveling, he seemed as intending to go farther;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>but they constrained him, saying, Abide with us, for it grows late, and the day is far spent. And he went to abide with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>While they were at table together, he took the loaf, and blessed and broke it, and distributed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Then their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he disappeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Did not our hearts burn within us, while he talked with us on the road, and expounded to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>Immediately they arose and returned to Jerusalem, where they found the eleven, and the rest of their company assembled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>who said, The Master is actually risen, and has appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>These also recounted what had happened on the road, and how he was made known to them in breaking the loaf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>While they discoursed in this manner, he stood in the midst of them, and said, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were amazed and affrighted, imagining that they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, Why are you so alarmed? And wherefore do suspicious arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet; it is I myself; handle me and be convinced; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>Saying this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>While yet they believed not, for joy and amazement, he said to them, Have you here anything to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of broiled fish, and of a honeycomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>which he took and eat in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, This is what I told you while I remained with you, that all the things which are written of me in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the Psalms, must be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds, that they might understand the scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it behooved the Messiah to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that reformation and the remission of sins should be proclaimed, in his name, among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>Now, you are witnesses of these things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>and behold I send you that which my Father has promised; but do you continue in this city, until you be invested with power from above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>He then led them out as far as Bethany, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And while he was blessing them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And having worshiped him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and were constantly in the temple, praising and blessing God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>This was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made by him, and without him not a single creature was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shone in darkness, but the darkness received it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>A man named John, was sent from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This man came as a witness, to testify concerning the light, that through him, all might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not himself the light; but came to testify concerning the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true light was he who, coming into the world, enlightens every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made by him; yet the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own land, and his own people did not receive him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>but to as many as received him, believing in his name, he granted the privilege of being children of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who derive their birth not from blood, nor from the desire of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became incarnate, and sojourned amongst us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of favor and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>(It was concerning him John testified, when he cried, This is He of whom I said, He that comes after me, is preferred to me; for he was before me.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>Of his fulness we all have received, even favor for favor's sake;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>for the law was given by Moses-the favor and the truth came by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one ever saw God; it is the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, who has made him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>Now this is the testimony of John. When the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem, to ask him, Who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>he acknowledged, and denied not, but acknowledged, saying, I am not the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, Who, then? Are you Elijah? He said, I am not. Are you the prophet? He answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said, Tell, then, who you are, that we may return an answer to them who sent us. What do you say of yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>«He answered, I am he whose voice proclaims in the wilderness,» 'Make straight the way of the Lord,' 'as said, the Prophet Isaiah.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now they who were sent, were of the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they questioned him further, Why, then, do you immerse, if you be not the Messiah, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered, I immerse in water, but there is one among you whom you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>It is he who comes after me, and was before me; whose shoe-string I am not worthy to loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This happened at Bethabara, upon the Jordan, where John was immersing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the next day, John sees Jesus coming to him, and says, Behold the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is He, concerning whom I said, After me a man comes, who is preferred to me; for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>As for me, I knew him not; but, that he might be made manifest to Israel, I am come immersing in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>John testified further, saying, I saw the spirit descending from heaven, like a dove, and remaining upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>For my part, I should not have known him, had not He, who sent me to immerse in water, told me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining, the same is He who immerses in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>Having, therefore, seen this, I testify that he is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>The next day, John, being with two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>observed Jesus passing, and said, Behold the Lamb of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples hearing this, followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus turning about, saw them following, and said to them, What do you seek? They answered, Rabbi, (which signifies Teacher,) where do you dwell?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He replied, Come, and see. They went, and saw where he dwelt, and it being about the tenth hour, abode with him that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two, who, having heard John, followed Jesus, was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>The first he met, was his own brother, Simon; to whom he said, We have found the Messiah, (a name equivalent to Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he brought him to Jesus. Jesus, looking upon him, said, You are Simon, the son of Jona; you shall be called Cephas, (which denotes the same as Peter.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The next day, he resolved to go to Galilee, and meeting Philip, said to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip meets Nathanael, and says to him, We have found the person described by Moses in the law, and by the prophets, Jesus, the son of Joseph, of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Nathanael says to him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip answered, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and said, concerning him, Behold an Israelite, indeed, in whom is no guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to him, Whence do you know me? Jesus answered, I saw you when you were under the fig tree, before Philip called you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael replying, said to him, Rabbi, you are the Son of God; you are the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered him, saying, Because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree, you believe!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>He added, Most assuredly, I say to you, hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending from the Son of Man, and descending to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>Three days after, there was a marriage in Cana, of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>Jesus, also, and his disciples, were invited to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>The wine falling short, the mother of Jesus said to him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus answered, Woman, what have you to do with me? My time is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, Do whatever he shall bid you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six water pots of stone, containing two or three baths each, placed there for the Jewish rites of cleansing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, Fill the pots with water. And they filled them to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>Then he said, Draw, now, and carry to the director of the feast. And they did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the director of the feast had tasted the wine made of water, not knowing whence it was, (but the servants who drew the water knew,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>he said, addressing the bridegroom, Every person presents the best wine first, and worse wine afterward, when the guests have drunk largely; but you have reserved the best till now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This first miracle Jesus wrought in Cana of Galilee, displaying his glory: and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>Afterward, he went to Capernaum, he and his mother, and his brothers, and his disciples; but they staid not there many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the Jewish passover being nigh, Jesus went to Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>and finding changers sitting in the temple, and people who sold cattle and sheep, and doves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>he made a whip of cords, and drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and cattle, scattering the coin of the changers, and oversetting their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and he said to them, who sold doves, Take these things hence. Make not my Father's house a house of traffic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>«(Then his disciples remembered these words of the scripture,'My zeal for thy house consumes me.')»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Therefore, the Jews answered, and said to him, By what miracle do you show us your title to do these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answering, said to them, Destroy this temple, and I will rear it again in three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews replied, Forty and six years was this temple in building; and you would rear it in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>(But, by the temple, he meant his body.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When, therefore, he was risen from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this, and they understood the scripture, and the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>While he was at Jerusalem, during the feast of the passover, many believed on him, when they saw the miracles which he performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself with them, because he knew them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>He needed not to receive from others a character of any man, for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a Pharisee called Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>who came to Jesus by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no man can do these miracles which you do, unless God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answering, said to him, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a man be born again, he can not discern the Reign of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus replied, How can a grown man be born? Can he enter his mother's womb anew, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless a man be born of water and Spirit, he can not enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; that which is born of the Spirit is Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Wonder not, then, that I have said to you, You must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The Spirit breathes where he pleases, and you hear the report of him, but know not whence he comes, or whither he goes; so is every one who is born of the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus replied, Are you the teacher of Israel, and know not these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Most assuredly, I say to you, we speak what we know, and testify what we have seen; yet you receive not our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If you understood not, when I told you earthly things, how will you understand when I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>For none has ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven; the Son of Man, whose abode is heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>As Moses placed on high the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be placed on high;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that whosoever believes on him may not perish, but obtain eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>for God has so loved the world, as to give his own begotten Son, that whosoever believes on him, may not perish, but obtain eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God has sent his Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world may be saved by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes on him shall not be condemned; he who believes not, is already condemned, because he has not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>Now this is the ground of condemnation; that light has come into the world, and men have preferred the darkness to the light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For whosoever does evil, hates the light, and shuns it, lest his deeds should be detected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who obeys the truth, comes to the light, that it may be manifest that his actions are agreeable to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this, Jesus went, with his disciples, into the territory of Judea, where he remained with them, and immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>John also was immersing in Enon, near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came thither, and were immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Now John's disciples had a dispute with a Jew, about purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>Then they went to John, and said to him, Rabbi, he who was with you near the Jordan, of whom you gave so great a character; he, too, immerses, and the people flock to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, A man can have no power but what he derives from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves are witness for me, that I said, I am not the Messiah; but am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>The bridegroom is he who has the bride; but the friend of the bridegroom, who assists him, rejoices to hear the bridegroom's voice: this, my joy, therefore, is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, while I decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He who comes from above, is above all. He who is from the earth is earthly, and speaks as being from the earth. He who comes from heaven, is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What he testifies, is what he has seen and heard; yet his testimony is not received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who receives his testimony, vouches the veracity of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>for he whom God has commissioned, relates God's own words; for to him God gives not the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has subjected all things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes on the Son, has life eternal; he who rejects the Son, shall not see life: but the vengeance of God awaits him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Jesus, knowing that the Pharisees were informed that he made and immersed more disciples than John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though it was not Jesus himself, but his disciples, who immersed,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>left Judea, and returned to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>Being obliged to pass through Samaria,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>he came to a Samaritan city, called Sychar, near the heritage which Jacob gave his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. And Jesus, wearied with the journey, sat down by the well, it being about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria, having come to draw water, Jesus said to her, Give me some drink,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>(for his disciples were gone into the city to buy food;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>the Samaritan woman answered, How is it, that you, who are a Jew, ask drink of me, who am a Samaritan? (For the Jews have no friendly intercourse with the Samaritans.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus replied, If you knew the bounty of God, and who it is that says to you, Give me some drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>She answered, Sir, you have no bucket, and the well is deep: whence, then, have you the living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank of it himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus replied, Whosoever drinks of this water, will thirst again;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whosoever will drink of the water which I shall give him, will never thirst more; but the water which I shall give him, will be in him a fountain, springing up to everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman answered, Sir, give me this water, that I may never be thirsty, nor come hither to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, Go, call your husband, and come back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>She answered, I have no husband. Jesus replied, You say well, I have no husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands; and he whom you now have, is not your husband. In this, you have spoken truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said, Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain; and you say, that in Jerusalem is the place, where me ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus answered, Woman, believe me, the time approaches when you shall neither come to this mountain, nor go to Jerusalem, to worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you know not, we worship what we know: for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the time comes, or, rather, is come, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such are the worshipers whom the Father requires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is Spirit, and they that worship him, must worship him in spirit and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman replied, I know that the Messiah comes, (that is, Christ;) when he is come, he will teach us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, I who speak to you, am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>Upon this, his disciples came, and wondered that he talked with a woman; yet none of them said, What do you seek? or, Why do you talk with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>Then the woman left her pitcher, and having gone into the city, said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man who has told me all that I ever did. Is this not the Messiah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They, accordingly, went out of the city, and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Meanwhile, the disciples entreating him, said, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>He answered, I have food to eat which you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>Then said his disciples, one to another, Has any man brought him food?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus answered, My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, After four months comes harvest? But I say, Lift up your eyes, and survey the fields; for they are already white enough for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>The reaper receives wages, and gathers the fruits of eternal life, that both the sower and the reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this, the proverb is verified, One sows, and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that on which you have bestowed no labor: others labored, and you get possession of their labors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Now, many Samaritans of that city believed him, on the testimony of the woman, who said, He told me all that ever I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>When, therefore, they came to him, they besought him to stay with them; and he staid there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed, because of what they heard from himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and they said to the woman, It is not, now, on account of what you have reported, that we believe; for we have heard him ourselves, and know that this is truly the Saviour of the world, the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After the two days, Jesus departed, and went to Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>for he had himself declared that a prophet is not regarded in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>Being come into Galilee, he was well received by the Galileans, who had seen all that he did at Jerusalem, during the festival; for they likewise attended the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>Then Jesus returned to Cana, of Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And there was a certain officer of the court, whose son lay sick at Capernaum,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>who having heard that Jesus was come from Judea into Galilee, went to him, and entreated him to come and cure his son, who was dying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus said to him, Unless you see signs and prodigies, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The officer answered, Come, Sir, before my child die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus replied, Go your way. Your son is well. And the man believed the word which Jesus had spoken, and went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>As he was returning, his servants met him, and informed him that his son was well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>He then inquired of them the hour when he began to get better. They answered, Yesterday, at the seventh hour, the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>Then the father knew, that it was the same hour in which Jesus said to him, Your son is well; and he, and all his family, believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This second miracle Jesus performed, after returning from Judea to Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>Afterward there was a Jewish festival, and Jesus went to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is at Jerusalem, nigh the sheep gate, a bath, called, in Hebrew, Bethesda, which has five covered walks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a great number of sick, blind, lame, and palsied people, waiting for the moving of the water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>(for a messenger at times descended into the bath, and agitated the water; and the first that stepped in, after the agitation of the water, was cured of whatever disease he had.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>Now, there was one there, who had been diseased thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jesus, who saw him lying, and knew that he had been long ill, said to him, Do you desire to be healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The diseased man answered, Sir, I have no person to put me into the bath, when the water is agitated; but while I am going, another gets down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, Arise, take up your couch and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>Instantly the man was healed, and took up his couch and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>Now, that day was the Sabbath. The Jews, therefore, said to him that was cured, This is the Sabbath. It is now lawful for you to carry the couch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered, He who healed me, said to me, Take up your couch and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him then, Who is the man that said to you, Take up your couch and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he that had been healed, knew who it was; for Jesus had slipped away, there being a crowd in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Jesus, afterward, finding him in the temple, said to him, Behold, you are cured; sin no more, lest something worse befall you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had cured him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>Therefore, the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he had done this on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father works until now; I also work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>For this reason the Jews were the more intent to kill him; because he had not only broken the Sabbath, but, by calling God his real Father, had equaled himself to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then Jesus addressed them, saying, Most assuredly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but as he sees the Father do: for what things soever he does, such does the Son, likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all that he himself does: nay, and will show him greater works than these, which will astonish you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises and quickens the dead, the Son also quickens whom he will:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>for the Father judges no person, having committed the power of judging entirely to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all might honor the Son; as they honor the Father. He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father, who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who hears my doctrine, and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not suffer condemnation, having passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Most assuredly, I say to you, the time comes; or, rather, is come, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and hearing, they shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For, as the Father has life in himself, so has he given to the Son, to have life in himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has given him even the judicial authority, because he is a Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Wonder not at this: for the time comes when all that are in their graves shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall come forth. They who have done good, shall arise to enjoy life; they who have done evil, shall arise to suffer punishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not to please myself, but to please him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I alone testify concerning myself, my testimony is not to be regarded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>there is another who testifies concerning me; and I know that his testimony of me ought to be regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You, yourselves, sent to John, and he bore testimony of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>As for me, I need no human testimony; I can only urge this for your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was the blazing and shining lamp; and for awhile, you were glad to enjoy his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have greater testimony than John's: for the works which the Father has empowered me to perform, the works themselves, which I do, testify for me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>Nay, the Father, who sent me, has himself attested me. Did you never hear his voice, or see his form?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>Or, have you forgotten his declaration, that you believe not him whom he has sent forth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the scriptures because you think to obtain by them eternal life. Now these, also, are witnesses for me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>yet you will not come to me, that you may obtain life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I desire not honor from men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>but I know you, that you are strangers to the love of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I am come in my Father's name, and you did not receive me; if another come, in his own name, you will receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe, while you court honor one from another, regardless of the honor which comes from God alone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I am he who will accuse you to the Father. Your accuser is Moses, in whom you confide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you believed Moses, you would believe me: for he wrote concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe my words?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>Afterward, Jesus crossed the sea of Galilee, also called of Tiberias;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>and a great multitude followed him, because they had seen the miraculous cures which he had performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up on a mountain; where he sat down with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the passover, the Jewish festival, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus, lifting up his eyes, and perceiving that a great multitude was flocking to him, said to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread to feed these people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>(This he said to try him; for he knew himself, what he was to do.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered, Two hundred denarii would not purchase bread enough to afford every one a morsel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>Here is a boy who has five barley loaves, and two small fishes; but what are they among so many?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, Make the men recline. Now, there was much grass in the place. So they reclined; in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, distributed them to those who had reclined. He gave them also of the fishes, as much as they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>When they had eat sufficiently, he said to his disciples, Gather up the fragments which remain, that nothing be lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>They, therefore, gathered, and with the fragments which the people had left of the five barley loaves, they filled twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When those men had seen the miracle which Jesus had wrought they said, This is certainly the prophet who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Then Jesus, knowing that they intended to come and carry him off, to make him king, withdrew again, alone, to the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>In the evening, his disciples went to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>and having embarked, were passing by sea to Capernaum. It was now dark; and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the water was raised by a tempestuous wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>When they had rowed about twenty-five or thirty furlongs, they observed Jesus walking on the sea, very near the bark, and were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he said to them, It is I, be not afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they gladly received him into the bark; and the bark was immediately at the place whither they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day, the people who were on the seaside, knowing that there had been but one boat there, and that Jesus went not into the boat with his disciples, who went alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>(other boats, however, arrived from Tiberias, nigh the place where they had eat, after the Lord had given thanks;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>knowing, besides, that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, embarked, and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>Having found him on the opposite shore, they said to him, Rabbi, when did you come hither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw miracles, but because you eat of the loaves, and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures through eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you; for to him the Father, that is, God, has given his attestation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They asked him, therefore, What are the works which God requires us to do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered, This is the work which God requires-- that you believe on him whom he has sent forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>They replied, What miracles, then, do you, that seeing it, we may believe you? What do you perform?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>«Our fathers eat the manna in the desert; as it is written,» 'He gave them bread of heaven to eat.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jesus then said to them, Most assuredly, I say to you, Moses did not give you the bread of heaven: but my Father gives you the true bread of heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>for the bread of God is that which descends from heaven, and gives life to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>They said, therefore, to him, Master, give us always this bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>Jesus answered, I am the bread of life. He who comes to me, shall never hunger; and he who believes on me, shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But, as I told you, though you have seen me, you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All the Father gives me, will come to me; and him who comes to me, I will not reject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I descended from heaven to do, not my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>Now, this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose none of all he has given me, but raise the whole again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>This is the will of him who sent me, that whoever recognizes the Son, and believes on him, should obtain eternal life, and that I should raise him again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews then murmured against him, because he said, I am the bread which descended from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>and they said, Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How, then, does he say, I descended from heaven!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered, Murmur not amongst yourselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>no man can come to me, unless the Father, who has sent me, draw him; and him I will raise again at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>«It is written in the prophets,» 'They shall be taught of God.' 'Every one who has heard, and learned from the Father, comes to me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any man, except him who is from God, has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who believes on me has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers eat the manna in the desert, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>Behold the bread which descended from heaven, that whosoever eats of it may not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread, which descended from heaven. Whosoever eats of this bread, shall live forever; and the bread that I will give, is my flesh, which I give for the life of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>The Jews then debated among themselves, saying, How can this man give us his flesh to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Jesus, therefore, said to them, Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink his blood, you have not life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>He that eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, has eternal life; and I will raise him again at the last day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>for my flesh is truly meat, and my blood is truly drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats my flesh, and drinks my blood, abides in me, and I abide in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the Father lives, who sent me; and I live by the Father; even so he, who feeds on me, shall live by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread which descended from heaven. It is not like what your fathers eat, for they died: he that eats this bread, shall live for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>This discourse he spoke in the synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many of his disciples having heard it, said, This is hard doctrine; who can understand it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples murmured at it, said to them, Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What if you should see the Son of Man reascending thither, where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit that quickens; the flesh profits nothing. The words which I speak to you, are spirit and life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe. (For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that did not believe, and who he was that would betray him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>He added, Therefore, I said to you, that no man can come to me, unless it be given him by my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From this time, many of his disciples withdrew, and accompanied him no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered, Master, to whom should we go? You have the words of eternal life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>and we believe, and know that you are the Holy One of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve? yet one of you is a spy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He meant Judas Iscariot, son of Simon; for it was he who was to betray him, though he was one of the twelve.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After this, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he would not reside in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now, the Jewish feast of tabernacles was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brothers, therefore, said to him, Leave this country, and go to Judea, that your disciples may also see the works which you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For whoever courts renown, does nothing in secret: since you perform such things, show yourself to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>(For not even his brothers believed on him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus answered, My time is not yet come; any time will suit you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world can not hate you; but me it hates, because I disclose the wickedness of its actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>Go you to this festival: I go not thither, because it is not my time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>Having said this, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when his brothers were gone, he also went to the festival; not publicly, but rather privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>At the festival, the Jews inquired after him, and said, Where is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much whispering among the people concerning him. Some said, He is a good man. Others, No; he seduces the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>No person, however, spoke freely of him, for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>About the middle of the festival, Jesus went into the temple, and was teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews said with astonishment, Whence comes this man's learning, who was never taught?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus made answer, My doctrine is not mine, but his who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If any one will do his will, he shall discern whether my doctrine proceeds from God, or from myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>Whosoever teaches what proceeds from himself, seeks to promote his own glory: whosoever seeks to promote the glory of him who sent him, deserves credit, and is a stranger to deceit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The people answered, You are possessed. Who seeks to kill you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus replied, I have performed one action, which surprises you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses instituted circumcision among you, (not that it is from Moses, but from the patriarchs,) and you circumcise on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If, on the Sabbath, a man receive circumcision, that the law of Moses may not be violated; are you incensed against me, because, on the Sabbath, I have cured a man, whose whole body was disabled?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Judge not from personal regards, but judge according to justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some inhabitants of Jerusalem, said, Is not this he whom they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>Lo! he speaks boldly, and they say nothing to him. Do the rulers, indeed, acknowledge that this is the Messiah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>But we know whence this man is; whereas, when the Messiah shall come, no person will know whence he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Jesus, who was then teaching in the temple, cried, Do you know both who, and whence I am? I came not of myself. But he is true, who sent me, whom you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>As for me, I know him, because I came from him, and am commissioned by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Then they sought to apprehend him, but none laid hands on him; for his hour was not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>Many of the people, however, believed on him, and said, When the Messiah shall come, will he do more miracles than this man does?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>When the Pharisees heard that the people muttered such things concerning him, they and the chief priests dispatched officers to seize him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Jesus, therefore, said, Yet a little while I remain with you; then I go to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You shall seek me, but shall not find me; nor be able to come where I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews said, among themselves, Whither will he go, that we shall not find him? Will he go to the dispersed Greeks, and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What does he mean, by saying, You shall seek me, but shall not find me, nor be able to get thither, where I shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>On the last, and greatest day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come to me, and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes on me, as the scripture says, shall be like a cistern, whence rivers of living waters shall flow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>This he spoke of the Spirit, which they who believed on him were to receive; for the Holy Spirit was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>Many of the people having heard what was spoken, said, This is certainly the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Some said, This is the Messiah. Others, does the Messiah come from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Does not the scripture say, that the Messiah will be of the posterity of David, and come from Bethlehem, the village whence David was?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>Thus the people were divided concerning him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>and some of them would have seized him, but no person laid hands upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>Then the officers returned to the chief priests and Pharisees, who asked them, Wherefore have you not brought him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, Never man spoke like this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees replied, Are you also seduced?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Has any of the rulers, or of the Pharisees, believed on him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this populace, which knows not the law, is accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus, one of themselves, (he who came to Jesus by night,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>said to them, Does our law permit us to condemn a man, without hearing him, and knowing what he has done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They answered him, Are you also a Galilean? Search, and you will find that prophets arise not out of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>Then every man went to his own house;</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>but Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>Early in the morning he returned to the temple, and all the people having come to him, he sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>Then the Scribes and Pharisees brought to him a woman, taken in adultery; and having placed her in the middle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>said to him, Rabbi, this woman was surprised in the act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now Moses has commanded in the law, that such should be stoned; and what do you say?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>They said this to try him, that they might have matter for accusing him. But Jesus, having stooped down, was writing with his finger, upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>As they continued asking him, he raised himself, and said to them, Let him who is sinless, amongst you, throw the first stone at her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>Again, having stooped down, he wrote upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>They, hearing that, withdrew, one after another, the eldest first, till Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Jesus, raising himself, and seeing none but the woman, said to her, Woman, where are those, your accusers? Has no person passed sentence on you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She answered, No person, Sir. Jesus said to her, Neither do I pass sentence on you. Go, and sin no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Again Jesus addressed the people, saying, I am the light of the world. He who follows me, shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees therefore retorted, You testify concerning yourself; your testimony is not to be regarded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered, Though I testify concerning myself, my testimony ought to be regarded; because I know whence I came, and whither I go. As for you, you know not whence I came, and whither I go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge from passion; I judge no person:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>and if I do, my judgment ought to be regarded, for I am not alone, but concur with the Father, who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>It is a maxim in your law, that the concurrent testimony of two is credible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>Now I am one who testify concerning myself; the Father that sent me is another that testifies of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>Then they asked him, Where is your Father? Jesus answered, You know neither me nor my Father: if you knew me, you would know my Father also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>These things he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple, and no person seized him, his hour not being yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Again, Jesus said to them, I am going away; you will seek me, and shall die in your sins; whither I go, you can not come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then said the Jews, Will he kill himself, that he says, Whither I go, you can not come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>He said to them, You are from beneath; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>therefore I said, You shall die in your sins; for if you believe not that I am he, you shall die in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>They, therefore, asked him, Who are you? Jesus answered, The same that I told you formerly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have many things to say of you, and to reprove in you: but he who sent me is worthy of belief; and I do but publish to the world what I have learned from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not perceive, that he meant the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>Jesus, therefore, said to them, When you shall have raised the Son of Man on high, then you shall know what I am; and that I do nothing of myself, and say nothing which the Father has not taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And he who sent me is with me. The Father has not left me alone, because I always do what pleases him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>While he spoke thus, many believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus, therefore, said to those Jews who believed on him, If you persevere in my doctrine, you are my disciples indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And you shall know the truth: and the truth shall make you free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>Some made answer, We are Abraham's offspring, and were never enslaved to any man. How do you say, You shall be made free?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus replied, Most assuredly, I say to you, whosoever commits sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>Now the slave abides not in the family perpetually, the Son abides perpetually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>If, therefore, the Son make you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you are Abraham's offspring, yet you seek to kill me, because my doctrine has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak what I have seen with my Father: and you do what you have learned from your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered, Abraham is our Father. Jesus replied, If you were Abraham's children, you would act as Abraham acted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I received from God. Abraham acted not thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You do the deeds of your father. They answered, We were not born of fornication, We have one Father, even God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus replied, If God were your Father, you would love me; for I proceeded, and am come from God. I came not of myself. He sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do you not understand my language? It is because you can not bear my doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>The devil is your father, and the desires of your father you will gratify: he was a manslayer from the beginning; he swerved from the truth, because there was no veracity in him. When he tells a lie, he speaks suitably to his character; for he is a liar, and the father of lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>As for me, because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Who of you convicts me of falsehood? And if I speak truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He who is of God, regards God's words. You regard them not, because you are not of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>The Jews then answered, Have we not reason to say, You are a Samaritan, and have a demon?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus replied, I have not a demon: but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>As for me, I seek not to promote my own glory; another seeks it, who judges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Most assuredly, I say to you, whoever keeps my word, shall never see death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>The Jews then said to him, Now we are certain that you have a demon: Abraham is dead, and the prophets; yet you say, Whoever keeps my word, shall never taste death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you greater than our Father Abraham, who is dead. The prophets also are dead: whom do you make yourself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, If I commend myself, my commendation is nothing: it is my Father, whom you call your God, who commends me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>Nevertheless, you know him not; but I know him: and if I should say, I know him not, I should speak falsely like you: but I know him, and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Abraham, your father, rejoiced that he should see my day; and he did see it, and was glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>The Jews replied, You are not yet fifty years old, and you have seen Abraham?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus answered, Most assuredly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>Then they took up stones to cast at him; but Jesus concealed himself, and went out of the temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>As Jesus passed along, he saw a man who had been born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>And his disciples asked him, saying, Rabbi, who sinned: this man, or his parents, that he was born blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, Neither this man nor his parents sinned. It was only that the works of God might be displayed upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>I must do the work of him who sent me, while it is day; the night comes, when no man can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>Having said this, he spit upon the ground, and with the clay, which he made with the spittle, anointed the blind man's eyes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>and said to him, Go wash in the pool of Siloam, (which signifies Sent.) He went, therefore, and washed them, and returned seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>Then the neighbors, and they who had before seen him blind, said, Is not this he who sat and begged?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some said, It is he; others, He is like him. He said, I am he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>They asked him, then, How did you receive your sight?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered, A man called Jesus, made clay and anointed my eyes, and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash your eyes. I went accordingly, and washed them, and saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>Then they asked him, Where is he? He answered, I know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>Then they brought him, who had been blind, to the Pharisees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>(now it was on a Sabbath, that Jesus made the clay, and gave him his sight.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>The Pharisees likewise, therefore, asked him how he had received his sight. He answered, He put clay on my eyes, and I washed them, and now see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Upon this some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, for he observes not the Sabbath. Others said, How can one that is a sinner perform such miracles? And they were divided among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>Again they asked the man, who had been blind, What do you say of him, for giving you sight? He answered, He is a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>But the Jews believed not that the man had been blind, and had received his sight; till they called his parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>and asked them, Do you say, that this is your son, who was born blind? How, then, does he now see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>His parents answered, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>but how he now sees, or who opened his eyes, we know not. He is of age, ask him; he will answer for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>His parents spoke thus, because they fear the Jews: for the Jews had already determined, that whosoever acknowledged Jesus to be the Messiah, should be expelled from the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>For this reason his parents said, He is of age, ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>A second time, therefore, they called the man, who had been born blind, and said to him, Give glory to God; we know that this man is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>He replied, Whether he be a sinner, I know not: one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, I now see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>They said to him again, What did he do to you? How did he make you see?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered, I told you before; did you not hear? Why would you hear it repeated? Will you, also, be his disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>They reviled him and said, You are his disciple. As for us, we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God spoke to Moses: as for this man, we know not whence he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man replied, This is surprising, that you know not whence he is, although he has given me sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>We know that God hears not sinners; but if any man worship God, and obey him, that man he hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>Never was it heard before, that any man gave sight to one born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They replied, You were altogether born in sin, and do you teach us? And they cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and having met him, said to him, Do you believe on the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>He answered, Who is he, Sir, that I may believe on him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>Jesus said to him, Not only have you seen him; but it is he, who talks with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>And he cried, Master, I believe; and threw himself prostrate before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>And Jesus said, For judgment am I come into this world, that they who see not, may see; and that they who see, may become blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>Some Pharisees, who were present, hearing this, said to him, Are we also blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>Jesus answered, If you were blind, you would not have sin: but you say, We see: therefore your sin remains.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.10'>
        <verse osisID='John.10.1'>Most assuredly, I say to you, he who enters not by the gate into the sheepfold, but climbs over the fence, is a thief and a robber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.2'>The shepherd always enters by the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.3'>To him, the porter opens, and the sheep obey his voice. His own sheep he calls by name, and leads out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.4'>And having put out his sheep, he walks before them, and they follow him; because they know his voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.5'>They will not follow a stranger, but flee from him; because they know not the voice of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.6'>Jesus addressed this similitude to them, but they did not comprehend what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.7'>He therefore added, Most assuredly, I say to you, I am the gate of the fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.8'>All who preceded me were thieves and robbers; but the sheep obeyed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.9'>I am the gate: such as enter by me shall be safe: they shall go in and out, and find pasture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.10'>The thief comes in only to steal, to slay, and to destroy. I am come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.11'>I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd gives his life for his sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.12'>The hireling, who is not the shepherd, and to whom the sheep do not belong, when he sees the wolf coming, abandons the sheep, and flees; and the wolf tears them, and disperses the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.14'>I am the good shepherd. And I know my own, and am known by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.15'>(even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father;) and I give my life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.16'>I have other sheep, besides, which are not of this fold. Them I must also bring; and they will obey my voice; and there shall be one flock, one shepherd.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.18'>No one forces it from me: but I give it of myself. I have power to give it, and I have power to resume it. This commandment I have received from my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>Again there was a division among the Jews, occasioned by this discourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>Many of them said, He has a demon, and is mad: why do you hear him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>Others said, These are not the words of a demonize. Can a demon give sight to the blind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.22'>Afterward, when they were celebrating the feast of the dedication, at Jerusalem,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>the Jews surrounding him, said to him, How long will you keep us in suspense? If you be the Messiah, tell us plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Jesus answered, I told you; but you believed not. The works which I do in my Father's name, testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>But you believe not, for you are not of my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep, as I told you, obey my voice; I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>Besides, I give them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any one wrest them out of my hands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>I and the Father are one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>Then the Jews again took up stones to stone him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus said to them, Many good works I have shown you from my Father; for which of these works do you stone me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered, For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy; because you, being a man, make yourself God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>«Jesus replied, Is it not written in your law,'I said, You are gods?'»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If the law styled them gods, to whom the word of God was addressed, and if the language of scripture in unexceptionable;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I do not the works of my Father, believe me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>But if I do, though you believe not me, believe the works, that you may know and believe, that the Father is in me, and I am in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>They then attempted again to seize him; but he escaped out of their hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>and retired again toward the Jordan, and abode in the place where John first immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many resorted to him, who said, John, indeed, wrought no miracle: but all that John spoke of this man, is true.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>Jesus hearing it, said, This sickness will not prove fatal; but conduce to the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>Having, then, heard that he was sick, Jesus staid two days in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Afterward, he said to the disciples, Let us return to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples answered, Rabbi, but very lately the Jews would have stoned you, and you would return thither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus replied, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not: because he sees the light of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>but if he walk in the night, he stumbles; because there is no light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>Having spoken this, he added, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go to wake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then said his disciples, Master, if he sleep, he will recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Jesus spoke of his death; but they thought that he spoke of the repose of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus told them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And on your account I am glad that I was not there, that you may believe; but let us go to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, that is, Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, Let us go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>When Jesus came, he found that Lazarus had been already four days in the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now, (Bethany being about fifteen furlongs from Jerusalem,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>many of the Jews came to Martha, and Mary, to comfort them on the death of their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha having heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him; but Mary remained in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then Martha said to Jesus, Master, if you had been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But I know that even now, whatever you shall ask of God, God will give you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, Your brother shall rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha replied, I know that he will rise at the resurrection, on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes on me, though he were dead, shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and no man who lives and believes on me, shall ever die. Do you believe this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She answered, Yes, Master, I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, He who comes into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>Having said this, she went and called Mary, her sister, aside, saying, The Teacher is come, and calls for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>When Mary heard this, she instantly rose and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet entered the village, but was in the place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews, then, who were condoling with Mary in the house, when they saw that she arose hastily, and went out, followed her, saying, She is going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary being come to the place where Jesus was, and seeing him, threw herself at his feet, saying, Had you be here, Master, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews weeping, who came with her, he groaned deeply, and was troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, Where have you laid him? They answered, and said, Master, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews, therefore, said, Mark how he loved him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, Could not he who gave sight to the blind man, even have prevented this man's death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus, therefore, again, groaning, came to the tomb. It was a cave, the entrance of which was shut up with a stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, Remove the stone. Martha, the sister of the deceased, answered, Sir, by this time, the smell is offensive, for this is the fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus replied, Did I not say to you, If you believe, you shall see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they removed the stone. And Jesus, lifting up his eyes, said, Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>As for me, I know that thou hearest me always; but I speak, for the people's sake who surround me, that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>After these words, raising his voice, he cried, Lazarus, come forth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>He who had been dead, came forth, bound hand and foot with fillets, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, Unbind him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many, therefore, of the Jews, who had come to Mary, and seen what he did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of the repaired to the Pharisees, and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled the Sanhedrim, and said, What are we doing? for this man works many miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him go on thus, every one will believe on him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and our nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>One of them, named Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, You are utterly at a loss,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>and do not consider, that it is better for us that one man die for the people, than that the whole nation should be ruined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>This he spoke, not of himself; but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for that nation only, but that he should assemble into one body the dispersed children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>From that day, therefore, they concerted how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>For that reason, Jesus appeared no longer publicly among the Jews, but retired to the country, near the desert, to a city called Ephraim; and continued there with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Meantime, the Jewish passover approached, and many went to Jerusalem from the country, before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>These inquired after Jesus, and said, one to another, as they stood in the temple, What do you think? Will he not come to the festival?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had issued an order, that whosoever knew where he was, he should make it known, that they might apprehend him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Six days before the passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper, and Martha served: but Lazarus was one of those who were at table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary, taking a pound of the balsam of spikenard, which was very valuable, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped them with her hair, so that the house was filled with the odor of the balsam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>On which, one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, who was to betray him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was not this balsam sold for three hundred denarii, which might have been given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the purse, and carried what was put in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Then Jesus said, Let her alone. She has reserved this to embalm me, against the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For you will always have the poor among you; but me you will not always have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>A great number of the Jews, knowing where he was, flocked thither, not on account of Jesus only, but likewise to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>The chief priests, therefore, determined to kill Lazarus also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because he proved the occasion that many Jews forsook them, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day, a great multitude, who were come to the festival, hearing that Jesus was on the road to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palm trees, and went out to meet him, crying, Hosanna! blessed be Israel's King, who comes in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Now Jesus having found a young ass, was riding on it, agreeably to what is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>«Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold your King comes, sitting on an ass's colt.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things the disciples did not understand, at first; but after Jesus was glorified, they remembered that thus it had been written concerning him, and that thus they had done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>And the people who had been present, attested that he had called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>It was the rumor that he had wrought this miracle, which made the people crowd to meet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees, therefore, said among themselves, Are you not sensible that you have no influence? Behold the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now, among those who came to worship at the festival, there were some Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These applied to Philip, of Bethsaida, in Galilee, making this request, Sir, we wish to see Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip went and told Andrew; then Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>Jesus answered them, saying, The time is come, when the Son of Man must be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Most assuredly, I say to you, when a grain of wheat is thrown into the ground, unless it die, it remains single; but if it die, it becomes very fruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life shall lose it; and he who hates his life in this world, shall preserve it eternally in the next.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>Would any man serve me? let him follow me; and where I am, there shall my servant also be. If any man serve me, my Father will reward him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? But I came on purpose for this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify thy name. Then came a voice out of heaven, which said, I have both glorified, and will again glorify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The people present heard the sound, and said, It thundered: others said, An angel spoke to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus said, This voice came not for my sake, but for yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now must this world be judged. Now must the prince of this world be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>As for me, when I shall be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men to myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>This he said, alluding to the death which he was to suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people answered, We have learned from the law, that the Messiah will live forever. How do you say, then, that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus said to them, Yet a little while the light continues with you; walk, while you have it, lest darkness overtake you: for he that walks in darkness knows not whither he goes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>Confide in the light, while you enjoy it, that you may be sons of light. Having spoken these words, he withdrew himself privately from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But, though he had performed so many miracles before them, they believed not on him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>«so that the word of the Prophet Isaiah was verified,» 'Lord, who has believed out report?' 'and, '«To whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this reason they could not believe; Isaiah having said, also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>«He has blinded their eyes, and blunted their understanding, that they might not see with their eyes, comprehend with their understanding, and be converted, that I might heal them.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things said Isaiah, when he saw his glory, and spoke concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless, there were several, even of the magistrates, who believed on him; but, for fear of the Pharisees, did not avow it, lest they should be expelled the synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they preferred approbation of men to the approbation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Then Jesus, raising his voice, said, He who believes on me, believes not on me only; but on him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who beholds me, beholds him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I am come a light into the world, that whosoever believes on me, may not remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if any man hear my words, but do not observe them; it is not I, who condemn him; for I came, not to condemn the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who despises me, and rejects my instructions, has that which condemns him. The doctrine which I have taught will condemn him at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not said anything from myself; but the Father who sent me, has commanded me what I should enjoin, and what I should teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know, that his commandment is eternal life. Whatever, therefore, I say, I speak as the Father has given me in charge.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Jesus having perceived, before the feast of the passover, that his time to remove out of this world to his Father, was come; and having loved his own, who were in the world, he loved them to the last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>Now while they were at the supper, (the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, though he knew that the Father had subjected everything to him, and that he came from God, and was returning to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>arose from supper, and laying aside his mantle, girt himself about with a towel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then he poured water into a basin, and began to wash the feet of his disciples, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>When he came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, Master, would you wash my feet?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter replied, You shall never wash my feet. Jesus answered, Unless I wash you, you can have no part with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus replied, He who has been bathing, needs only to wash his feet; the rest of his body being clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>You are clean, but not all. For he knew who would betray him; therefore he said, You are not all clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>After he had washed their feet, he put on his mantle, and replacing himself at table, said to them, Do you understand what I have been doing to you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>After uttering these words, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and declared, saying, Most assuredly, I say to you, one of you will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>Then the disciples looked one upon another, doubting of whom he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>Now one of his disciples, one whom Jesus loved, was lying close to his breast:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Simon Peter, therefore, made a sign to him, to inquire whom he meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>He, then, reclining on Jesus' bosom, said to him, Master, who is it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, It is he to whom I shall give this morsel, after I have dipped it. And having dipped the morsel, he gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>After receiving the morsel, Satan entered into him. And Jesus said to him, What you do, do quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.28'>But none at the table knew, why he gave this order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>Some imagined, because Judas had the purse, that Jesus had signified to him to buy necessaries for the festival; or, to give something to the poor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.1'>When Jesus had spoken these words, he passed, with his disciples, over the brook Kidron; where was a garden, into which he entered, and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.2'>Now Judas, who betrayed him, knew the place; because Jesus often resorted thither with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.3'>Then Judas, having got the cohort and officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, came thither with lanterns, and torches, and arms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.4'>But Jesus, who knew all that was coming upon him, went forth, and said to them, Whom do you seek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.5'>They answered him, Jesus, the Nazarene. Jesus replied, I am he. Now Judas, who betrayed him, was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.6'>He had no sooner said to them, I am he, than they, going backward, fell to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.7'>He, therefore, asked them again, Whom do you seek? They said, Jesus, the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.8'>Jesus answered, I have told you, that I am he. If, therefore, you seek me, let these go away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.9'>Thus was that which he had spoken verified, Of those whom thou gavest me, I have lost none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.10'>Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it, and smote the high priest's servant, and cut off his right ear. Now the servant's name was Malchus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.11'>Jesus then said to Peter, Put up the sword into the scabbard. Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.12'>Then the cohort, and their commander, and the Jewish officers, apprehended Jesus; and having bound him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.13'>brought him first to Annas, because he was father-in-law to Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.14'>Now it was Caiaphas, who had said in council to the Jews, It is expedient that one man die for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.15'>Meantime Simon Peter, and another disciple, followed Jesus. That disciple, being known to the high priest, entered his court with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.16'>But Peter stood without, at the door. Therefore the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out, and spoke to the portress, and brought in Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.17'>Then the maid, the portress, said to Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples? He answered, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.18'>Now, the servants and the officers, stood near a fire, which they had made, because it was cold, and warmed themselves. And Peter was standing with them, and warming himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.19'>Then the high priest interrogated Jesus concerning his disciples and his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.20'>Jesus answered, I spoke openly to the world; I always taught in the synagogues and in the temple, whither the Jews constantly resort. I said nothing in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.21'>Why do you examine me? Examine them who heard me teach. They know what I said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>When he had spoken thus, one of the officers who attended, gave him a blow, and said, Do you answer the high priest thus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus replied, If I have spoken amiss, show in what the wrong consists: but if well, why do you smite me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Now, Annas had sent him bound to Caiaphas, the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>As Peter stood warming himself, they asked him, Are not you also one of his disciples? He denied it, and said, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the servants of the high priest, a kinsman to him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, Did I not see you in the garden with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Peter denied again; and immediately the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then they led Jesus from the house of Caiaphas to the praetorium: it was now morning; but the Jews entered not the praetorium, lest they should be defiled, and so not in a condition to eat the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>Pilate, therefore, went out to them, and said, Of what do you accuse this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered, If he were not a criminal, we would not have delivered him to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate said, Then take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law. The Jews replied, We are not permitted to put any man to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>And thus, what Jesus had spoken, signifying what death he should die, was accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate returned to the praetorium, and having called Jesus, said to him, Are you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered, Do you say this of yourself, or did others tell you concerning me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate replied, Am I am Jew? Your own nation, yes, the chief priests have delivered you to me. What have you done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my adherents would have fought to prevent my falling into the hands of the Jews; but my kingdom is not hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Then Pilate said, You are a King, then? Jesus answered, You say that I am a King. For this I was born; and for this I came into the world, to give testimony to the truth. Whosoever is of the truth, hearkens to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate asked him, What is truth? and so saying, went out again to the Jews, and said to them, For my part, I find nothing culpable in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But since it is customary that I release to you one at the passover, will you that I release to you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all cried, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate caused him to be scourged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers crowned him with a wreath of thorn, which they had platted; and having thrown a purple mantle about him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>said, Hail! King of the Jews! and gave him blows on the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate went out again, and said to them, Lo, I bring him forth to you, that you may know that I find in him nothing culpable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Jesus then went forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple mantle, and Pilate said to them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried, saying, Crucify, crucify him! Pilate said to them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him; for my part, I find no fault in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he assumed the title of the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate heard this, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and having returned to the praetorium, said to Jesus, Whence are you? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said to him, Will you not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to crucify you, and power to release you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus replied, You could have no power over me, unless it were given you from above; wherefore, he who delivered me to you, has greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From that time Pilate sought to release him; but the Jews exclaimed, If you release this man, you are not Cesar's friend. Whoever calls himself king, opposes Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Pilate, on hearing these words, ordered Jesus to be brought forth, and sat down on the tribunal, in a place named The Pavement; in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>(Now it was the preparation of the Paschal Sabbath, about the sixth hour.) And he said to the Jews, Behold your King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Away, away with him; crucify him. Pilate said to them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no King but Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>He delivered him, therefore, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>Then they took Jesus, and led him away. And he, carrying his cross, went out to a place called The Place of Skulls, which is, in Hebrew, Golgotha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and two others with him; one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate also wrote a title, and put it on the cross. The words were, JESUS, THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>And many of the Jews read this title, (for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh the city,) and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>then the chief priests said to Pilate, Write not the King of the Jews; but, Who calls himself King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>When the soldiers had nailed Jesus to the cross, they took his mantle and divided it into four parts, one to every soldier: they also took the coat, which was seamless, woven from the top throughout;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>«and said, among themselves, Let us not tear it, but determine by lot whose it shall be; by this verifying the scripture, which says,» 'They shared my mantle among them, and cast lots for my vesture.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Thus, therefore, acted the soldiers. Now, there stood near the cross of Jesus, his mother, and her sister Mary, the wife of Cleopas, and Mary the Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Then Jesus, observing his mother, and the disciple whom he loved, standing by, said to his mother, Woman, behold your son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, Behold your mother. And from that hour, the disciple took her to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, (knowing that all was now accomplished,) that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>And there was a vessel there full of vinegar, they filled a sponge with vinegar, and, having fastened it to a twig of hyssop, held it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished; and bowing his head, yielded up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews, therefore, lest the bodies should remain on the cross on the Sabbath, for it was the preparation, (and that Sabbath was a great day,) besought Pilate that their legs might be broken, and the bodies might be removed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Accordingly, the soldiers came, and broke the legs of the first and of the other, who were crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus, and found that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers with a spear, pierced his side, whence blood and water immediately issued.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>He was an eye-witness, who attests this, and his testimony deserves credit: nay, he is conscious that he speaks truth, that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>«For these things happened that the scripture might be verified,» 'None of his bones shall be broken.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>«Again, the scripture elsewhere says,» 'They shall look on him whom they have pierced.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After this, Joseph, the Arimathean, who was a disciple of Jesus, but a concealed disciple for fear of the Jews, asked permission of Pilate to take away the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>Nicodemus also, who had formerly repaired to Jesus by night, came, and brought a mixture of myrrh and aloes, weighing about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>These men took the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen rollers, with the spices, which is the Jewish manner of embalming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now, in the place where he was crucified, there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb, wherein no one had ever yet been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There they deposited Jesus, on account of the Jewish preparation, the tomb being near.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>The first day of the week, Mary, the Magdalene, went early to the sepulcher, while it was yet dark; and saw that the stone had been removed from the entrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Then she came running to Simon Peter, and to that other disciple whom Jesus loved, and said to them, They have taken the Master out of the sepulcher; and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Immediately Peter went out, and the other disciple, to go to the sepulcher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>and both ran together, but the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the sepulcher;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>and stooping down, he saw the linen rollers lying, but went not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then came Simon Peter, who followed him, and went into the sepulcher, where he observed the rollers lying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the handkerchief which had been wrapped about his head, not laid beside them, but folded up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who came first to the sepulcher, entered also; and he saw, and believed the report.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For, as yet, they did not understand from the scriptures, that he was to rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples returned to their companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood without, near the sepulcher, weeping. As she wept, stooping down to look into the sepulcher,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>she saw two angles in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head, the other at the feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they said to her, Woman, why do you weep? She answered, Because they have taken away my Master, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>Having said this, she turned about, and saw Jesus standing, but knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus aid to her, Woman, why do you weep? Whom do you seek? She, supposing him to be the gardener, answered, Sir, if you have conveyed him hence, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, Mary. She, turning, said to him, Rabboni; that is, Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, Touch me not, for I have not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary, the Magdalene, went and informed the disciples, that she had seen the Master, and that he had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>In the evening of that day, the first of the week, Jesus came where the disciples were convened, (the doors having been shut, for the fear of the Jews,) and stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>Having said this, he showed them his hand and his side. The disciples, therefore, rejoiced when they saw it was their Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus said again to them, Peace be to you. As the Father has sent me, so do I send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>After these words, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>Whose sins soever you remit, are remitted to them; and whose sins soever you retain, are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Now, Thomas, that is, Didymus, one of the twelve, was not with them, when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples, therefore, said to him, We have seen the Master. But he answered, Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger to the print of the nails, and my hand to his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>Eight days after, the disciples being again in the house, and Thomas with them, Jesus came, the doors having been shut, and stood in the midst and said, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then turning to Thomas, Reach hither your finger, he said, and look at my hands; reach also your hand, and feel my side; and be not incredulous, but believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered, My Lord, and my God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus replied, Because you see me, you believe; happy they, who, having never seen, shall nevertheless believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Many other miracles Jesus likewise performed in the presence of his disciples, which are not recorded in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>But these are recorded, that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God; and, that believing, you may have life through his name.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>Afterward, Jesus again appeared to the disciples, at the sea of Tiberias; and in this manner he appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter and Thomas, that is, Didymus, Nathanael of Cana, in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples of Jesus, being together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said, I am going a-fishing. They answered, We will go with you. Immediately they went, and got aboard a bark, but that night caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>In the morning Jesus stood on the shore; the disciples, however, knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus said to them, My children, have you any victuals? They answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>Cast the net, cried he, on the right side of the bark, and you will find. They did so, but were not able to draw it, by reason of the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved, said to Peter, It is the Master. Simon Peter, hearing that it was the Master, girt on his upper garment (which was laid aside) and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the boat, (for they were not farther from land than about two hundred cubits,) dragging the net, with the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they came ashore, they saw a fire burning, and a fish laid on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, Bring of the fishes which you have now taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went back, and drew the net to land, full of large fishes, a hundred and fifty-three; and the net was not rent, notwithstanding the number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, Come and dine. Meantime none of the disciples ventured to ask him, Who are you? knowing that it was the Master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus drew near, and taking bread and fish, distributed among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is the third time that Jesus appeared to his disciples, after his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they had dined, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me more than these? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>A second time he said, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? He answered, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you. Jesus replied, Tend my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>A third time he said, Simon, son of Jonas, do you love me? Peter, grieved at his asking this question a third time, answered, Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you. Jesus replied, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Most assuredly, I say to you, in your youth you girt yourself, and went whither you would; but in your old age, you shall stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you whither you would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This he spoke, signifying by what death he should glorify God. After these words, he said to him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>And Peter turning about, saw the disciple, whom Jesus loved, following, (the same who, leaning on his breast at the supper, had asked who it was, that would betray him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter seeing him, said to Jesus, And what, Lord, shall become of this man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus answered, If I will that he wait my return, what is that to you? Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Hence arose the rumor among the brethren, that that disciple should not die; nevertheless, Jesus said not, that he should not die; but, If I will, that he wait my return, what is that to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>It is this disciple, who attests these things, and wrote this account; and we know that his testimony deserves credit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>There were many other things also performed by Jesus, which, were they to be severally related, I imagine, the world itself could not contain the volumes that would be written.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The former narrative I composed, O Theophilus, concerning all things which Jesus began to do and teach,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>To whom, also, he presented himself alive, after his sufferings, by many infallible proofs; being seen by them forty days, and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And having assembled them together, he charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, said he, you have heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>For John, indeed, immersed in water, but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit, within a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>They, therefore, being assembled together, asked him, saying, Lord, wilt thou, at this time, restore the kingdom to Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>But he said to them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the Father has reserved to himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But you shall receive power by the Holy Spirit coming upon you, and shall be my witnesses in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and even to the remotest parts of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And while they were steadfastly looking up to heaven, as he ascended, behold two men in white raiment stood near them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who also said, Galileans, why do you stand gazing up to heaven? This Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall also come in the same manner as you have seen him going to heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they were come into the city, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James, son of Alpheus, and Simon, the Zealot, and Judas, brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These all unanimously persevered in prayer, with the women, and with Mary, the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in these days, Peter, rising up in the midst of the disciples, (now the number of persons assembled was about a hundred and twenty,) said</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>It is necessary, therefore, that one of the men who have continued with us all the time the Lord Jesus was conversant among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>commencing from his immersion by John, until the day of his assumption, should be constituted a witness with us, of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they set up two men, Joseph, called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And they prayed, saying, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, show which of these two thou hast chosen,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And there appeared to them tongues resembling fire, distinctly separated, and it rested upon each of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak in other languages, as the Spirit gave them utterance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>And Peter said to them, Reform, and be each of you immersed in the name of Jesus Christ, in order to the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off; as many as the Lord our God shall call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words he testified, and exhorted, saying, Save yourselves from this perverse generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>They, therefore, who received his word with readiness, were immersed: and there were added to the disciples that very day, about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they continued steadfast in the teaching, in the fellowship, in the breaking of the load, and in the prayers of the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>Fear also fell upon every soul, and many miracles and signs were wrought by the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all that believed were together, and had all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They also sold their possessions and effects, and distributed them to every one according to his necessity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>Moreover, they continued unanimously in the temple every day; and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of their food with joy and simplicity of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God, having favor with all the people: and the Lord daily added the saved to the congregation.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now, about that time, Peter and John went up to the temple, at the hour of prayer, being the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certain man, who had been lame from his birth, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple, which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of those that entered into the temple;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, begged to receive alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>But Peter, with John, looking steadfastly upon him, said, Look on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And he fixed his eyes upon them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter said, Silver and gold I have none, but what I have I give you: in the name of Jesus Christ, the Nazarene, rise up and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And, taking him by the right hand, he raised him up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones were strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And leaping up, he stood, and walked about, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking, and praising God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>and they knew him to be the same person who sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple, and were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And while he kept fast hold of Peter and John, all the people ran together to them, exceedingly astonished, in the portico called Solomon's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And Peter, seeing this, answered the people, Israelites, why do you wonder at this? or why do you fix your eyes on us, as if by our own power, or piety, we had made this man to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Son Jesus, whom you delivered up, and rejected in the presence of Pilate, when he was desirous to release him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>but you rejected the Holy and Righteous One, and desired a murderer to be granted to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>and killed the Prince of Life, whom God has raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>and his name, through faith in his name, has made this man strong, whom ye see and know; yes, the faith which is by him, has given him this perfect soundness, in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance you did it, as did also your rulers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>but those things which God foretold, by the mouth of all his prophets, that the Messiah should suffer, he has thus fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Reform, therefore, and return to God, that so your sins may be blotted out; that seasons of refreshment may come from the presence of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and that he may send Jesus Christ, who was before designed for you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom, indeed, heaven must retain till the time of the accomplishment of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets, from the beginning of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>«Moses truly said, to the fathers,» 'A prophet like me shall the Lord your God raise up for you, from among your brethren; him shall you obey in all things, whatsoever he shall say to you:'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>And while they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple guard, and the Sadducees, came upon them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being grieved that they taught the people, and announced, through Jesus, the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they laid hands on them, and committed them into custody to the next day; for it was now evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who had heard the word, believed: and the number of the men was about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And the next day their rulers, elders, and scribes, gathered together at Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>both Annas, the high priest, and Caiaphas; also John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the high priest's kindred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And having set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have you done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, full of the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that through the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God has raised from the dead: yes, by HIM this man stands before you hale.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the stone which was set at nought by you builders, that is become the head of the corner:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Now, when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and understood that they were illiterate men, and in private stations in life, they were astonished, and recollected their having been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And seeing the man that was cured standing with them, they had nothing to say against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>But having ordered them to withdraw out of the council, they conferred among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, What shall we do with these men? for that indeed a signal miracle has been wrought by them, is manifest to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and we can not deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>Nevertheless, that it may not spread any further among the people, let us charge them, with the severest threats, to speak no more to any man in this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And having called them, they charged them neither to speak nor teach any more in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John, answering them, said, Whether it be just in the sight of God, to obey you rather than God, judge you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>for we can not but speak the things which we have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>And having threatened them again, they dismissed them, on account of the people, finding nothing for which they might punish them; because all the people glorified God for that which was done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>for the man on whom this miracle of healing was wrought, was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And being dismissed, they came to their own company, and related all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And when they heard it, they lifted up their voice with one accord to God, and said, Lord, thou art the God who didst make heaven and earth; and the sea, and all things that are in them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>«who didst say by the mouth of thy servant David,» 'Why did the heathen rage, and the people imagine vain things?'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For of a truth, against thy holy Son Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the heathen, and the people of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>have combined to do what thy hand and thy counsel marked out before to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now, O Lord, regard their threatenings; and give to thy servants to speak thy word with all freedom;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And while they were praying, the place in which they were assembled was shaken: and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>Now the heart and soul of the multitude of believers was one: nor did any one call any of his possessions his own; but all things were common among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And with great power did the Apostles give forth their testimony concerning the resurrection of the Lord Jesus: and great kindness was among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>Neither was there one indigent person among them; for as many as were proprietors of lands or houses, sold them, and brought the price of the things they sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and laid it down at the feet of the Apostles: and distribution was made to each according to his need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>And Joses, who, by the Apostles, was surnamed Barnabas, (which being interpreted, signifies a Son of Exhortation,) a Levite, and by birth a Cyprian,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>having an estate, sold it, and brought the money and laid it down at the feet of the Apostles.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a certain man, named Ananias, with Sapphira, his wife, sold an estate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>and secreted a part of the price, his wife also, being privy to it: and bringing a certain part, he laid it down at the feet of the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart, that you should attempt to impose on the Holy Spirit, and to secrete a part of the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>While it remained, did it not continue yours? and when it was sold, was it not at your own disposal? Why have you admitted this thing into your heart? You have not lied to men, but to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired: and great fear fell on all that heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>Then the young men arose, and bound him up, and carrying him out, they buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>After the interval of about three hours, his wife, also, not knowing what was done, came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>And Peter said to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>Then Peter said to her, How is it that you have conspired together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold the feet of those who have been burying your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>And immediately she fell down at his feet, and expired: and the young men coming in, found her dead, and carried her out, and buried her by her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear came on all the assembly, and on all that heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>And many signs and wonders were done among the people by the hands of the Apostles, (and they were all unanimously in Solomon's portico;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>and not one of the rest presumed to join himself to them, but the people magnified them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>and believers were more and more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>insomuch that along the streets they brought out the sick, and laid them on beds, and couches, that even the shadow of Peter, coming by, might overshadow some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>And multitudes also, out of the cities round about, came together to Jerusalem, bringing the sick, and those that were troubled with unclean spirits, who were all healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>But the high priest arising, and all they that were him, being the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with zeal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>and laid their hands on the Apostles, and put them into the common prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But a messenger of the Lord, by night, opened the doors of the prison, and bringing them out, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>Go, and presenting yourselves in the temple, speak to the people all the words of this life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>And hearing this, they went very early into the temple, and taught. But the high priest being come, and they that were with him, they called together the Sanhedrim, even the whole Senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But when the officers came, they found them not in the prison. Returning, therefore, they made their report,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying, We found, indeed, the prison shut with all safety, and the keepers standing before the doors; but, having opened them, we found no one within.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>Now, when the high priest, and the captain of the temple guard, and the chief priests heard these words, they doubted concerning them, what this could be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>But one came, and told them, Behold, the men whom you put in prison, are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain went, with the officers, and brought them, (not by violence, for they feared the people, lest they should be stoned:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>and when they had brought them, they set them before the Sanhedrim. And the high priest asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>saying, Did we not strictly charge you, that you should not teach in this name? and behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and would bring this man's blood upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>But Peter and the other Apostles answered, and said, It is necessary to obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom you slew, hanging him on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>HIM has God exalted at his right hand, a Prince and Saviour, to give reformation to Israel, and remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>And we are witnesses of these things, and the Holy Spirit also, whom God has given to them who submit to his government.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>And when they heard this, they were enraged, and consulted to put them to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>But a certain Pharisee in the Sanhedrim, whose name was Gamaliel, a doctor of law, in great esteem among all the people, rose up, and commanded the Apostles to be taken out for a little while;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>and he said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what you are about to do to these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>Some time ago Theudas arose, pretending himself to be a person of note: to whom a number of men, about four hundred, adhered, who was slain; and all who hearkened to him were scattered, and came to nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now, in the present case, I say to you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this design and work be of men, it will be defeated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>but if it be of God, you can not defeat them: lest, perhaps, you be found fighters against God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>And they yielded to him; and having called in the Apostles, and scourged them, they charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>And they departed from the presence of the Sanhedrim. rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be exposed to infamy for the sake of his name.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>Now, in these days, the number of the disciples being multiplied, there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists that is, Jews who used the Greek language against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministrations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>And the twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples together, said, It is by no means agreeable, that we should leave the word of God to attend tables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>therefore, brethren, look out from among yourselves seven men of an attested character, full of spirit and wisdom, whom we may set over this business;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>And the speech was pleasing to all the multitude, and they elected Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nichanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicholas, a proselyte of Antioch;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>Then there arose some of the synagogue, which is called that of the Libertines, and of the Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and of them of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>And they were not able to resist the wisdom and spirit with which he spoke.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.4'>Nevertheless, they who were dispersed, went about declaring the glad tidings of the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.5'>Then came Philip to the city of Samaria, and announced the Messiah to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.6'>And the people unanimously attended to the things that were spoken by Philip; as they heard them, and saw the miracles which he performed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.8'>And there was great joy in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.9'>But there was a certain man named Simon, who had, before, in that city, used magic, and astonished the nation of Samaria; pretending himself to be some extraordinary person:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.11'>And they paid regard to him; because he had, for a long time, astonished them wit his enchantments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.12'>But when they gave credit to Philip, declaring the glad tidings concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ: they were immersed, both men and women.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning from the scripture, told him the glad tidings concerning Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>And as they went along the way, they came to a certain water, and the officer said, Behold, water; what hinders my being immersed?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>And as he was proceedings on his journey, and was come near to Damascus, on a sudden, a light from heaven shone around him;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>He evidently saw, in a vision, about the ninth hour of the day, a messenger of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>On the next day, while they were on their journey, and drew near the city, Peter went up to the top of the house to pray, about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he was hungry, and would have taken a little refreshment; but while they were preparing, he fell into an ecstasy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>and he saw heaven opened, and something descending like a great sheet, fastened at the four corners, and let down to the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which there were all sorts of things, even four-footed animals of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>And this was done three times, and the sheet was taken up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>While Peter was pondering in himself, what the vision, which he had seen, might import; behold, the men, who were sent from Cornelius, having inquired out the house of Simon, stood at the door;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>and calling, they asked, if Simon, whose surname was Peter, lodged there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>Now, as Peter was reflecting on this vision; the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are inquiring for you:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Peter went down to the men, who were sent to him from Cornelius, and said, Behold, I am the man whom you seek; what is the cause of your coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, Cornelius, the centurion, a righteous man, who fears God, and has a character attested by all the Jewish people, has been instructed, by a holy messenger, to send for you to his house, and to hear words from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Having, therefore, called them in, he entertained them, and the next day set out with them: and some of the brethren, who were of Joppa, went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And the next day they entered into Caesarea; and Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relations and intimate friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>Now, as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and prostrating himself at his feet, made obeisance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>send, therefore, to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he lodges in the house of one Simon, a tanner, by the seaside; who, when he is come, shall speak to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Immediately, therefore, I sent to you, and you have done well in coming. Now, therefore, we are all here present before God, to hear all things which God has given to you in charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter, opening his mouth, said, Of a truth, I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but, in every nation, he that fears him, and works of righteousness, is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>This is that message which he sent to the children of Israel; proclaiming the glad tidings of peace by Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>You know the report there was, through all Judea, which began from Galilee, after the immersion which John preached,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>concerning Jesus of Nazareth; how God anointed him with the Holy Spirit, and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all who were oppressed by the devil; for God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are witnesses of all things which he did, both in the region of the Jews, and in Jerusalem: whom they slew, hanging him on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>This very person God raised up, on the third day, and granted him to become manifest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to witnesses before appointed by God, even to us, who have eat and drunk with him after he arose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he has given in charge to us to proclaim to the people, and to testify that it is he who is appointed by God, to be the judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To him all the prophets bear witness, that every one who believes on him, shall receive forgiveness of sins by his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were hearing the word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>and they of the circumcision, who believed, as many as came with Peter, were astonished that the gift of the Spirit was poured out upon the Gentiles also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>for they heard them speaking in diverse languages, and glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Then Peter answered, Can any one forbid water, that these persons should not be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he ordered them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. And they entreated him to continue with them several days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the Apostles and brethren who were in Jerusalem, heard, that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they who were of the circumcision contended with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, You did go in to men who were uncircumcised, and did eat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>And Peter beginning, opened to them the matter in order, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>I was praying in the city of Joppa; and, in a trance, I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending from heaven, let down by the four corners, and it came close to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>and looking attentively upon it, I observed, and saw four-footed creatures of the earth, and wild beasts, and reptiles, and fowls of the air:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>and I heard a voice saying to me, Arise, Peter, kill, and eat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>but I said, By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>And the voice answered me the second time from heaven, Those things which God has cleansed, do not you call common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>And this was done three times. And all the things were drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And behold, at that instant, three men were come to the house in which I was, sent from Caesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit commanded me to go with them, without any scruple: and these six brethren also went along with me. And we entered into the man's house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>and he told us how he had seen a messenger standing in his house, and saying to him, Send to Joppa, and bring hither Simon, whose surname is Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>who shall speak words to you, by which you and all your family shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them, as on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John immersed in water; but you shall be immersed in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>Since, therefore, God gave to them the same gift as he did to us, who had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, what was I, that I should be able to obstruct God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>And when they heard these things, they acquiesced, and glorified God; saying, God has, then, given to the Gentile also reformation to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Now, indeed, those who had been dispersed, on account of the distress which arose about Stephen, had traveled as far as Phenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to none but Jews only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>Yet some of the, being men of Cyprus, and Cyrene; when they came to Antioch, spoke to the Greeks, announcing the glad tidings concerning the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed, and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And the report concerning them came to the ears of the congregation that was at Jerusalem; and they sent Barnabas, to go as far as Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>Who, when he was come, and beheld the favor of God, rejoiced, and exhorted them all to adhere to the Lord, with full determination of heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>for he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit, and of faith: and a considerable number were added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then Barnabas went to Tarsus, to seek Saul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>and finding him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass, that they assembled with the congregation, for a whole year, and taught considerable numbers; and the disciples were first named Christians at Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>And in these days prophets came from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>And one of them, whose name was Agabus, stood up, and signified by the Spirit, that there should be a great famine over all the land: which came to pass in the days of Claudius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>And the disciples determined, that, according to the respective abilities of each, they should send to the assistance of the brethren who dwelt in Judea.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>And he slew James, the brother of John, with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And as he saw that this was acceptable to the Jews, he went on to seize Peter also: and it was in the days of unleavened bread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>and having seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him to the custody of four quaternions of soldiers, intending, after the passover, to bring him out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>In the meantime, therefore, Peter was kept in the prison; but earnest and continued prayer was made to God on his account, by the congregation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And passing through the first and second watch, they came to the iron gate that leads into the city; which opened to them of its own accord. And going out, they went through one street, and immediately the messenger departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And Peter, being come to himself, said, Now I know truly, that the Lord has sent his messenger, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod, and from all the expectations of the Jewish people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And recollecting, he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John, who was surnamed Mark; where many were gathered together, praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And as Peter knocked at the door of the outer gate, a maiden, whose name was Rose, went to inquire who was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And knowing Peter's voice, transported with joy, she did not open the gate: but running in, told them that Peter was standing at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>And they said to her, You are distracted: but she confidently affirmed that it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter continued knocking; and when she opened the door, they saw him, and were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>And he made a sign to them with his hand to be silent; and related to them how the Lord had conducted him out of prison. And he aid, Inform James and the brethren of these things: and departing, he went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>And as soon as it was day, there was no small tumult among the soldiers, what was become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And Herod searching for him, and not finding him, examined the keeper, and ordered them to be led away to execution. and passing from Judea to Caesarea, he abode there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>And he was highly incensed against the Tyrians and Sidonians; but they unanimously came before him; and gaining Blastus, the king's chamberlain, to their interest, they begged for peace; because their country was nourished by that of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>And upon a set day, Herod, being arrayed in a royal habit, and seated upon the throne, made an oration to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>And the people cried out, It is the voice of a God, and not of a man!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>And they sailed thence to Antioch, whence they had been recommended to the grace of God, for that work which they had accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>And when they were come thither, and had gathered the congregation together, they related what God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>And they spent a considerable time there with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>In the meantime, some, who came down from Judea, taught the brethren, Except you be circumcised, according to the manner of Moses, you can not be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>There being, therefore, a contention, and no small debate with them, on the part of Paul and Barnabas; they resolved that Paul and Barnabas, and some others of their number, should go up to the Apostles and elders at Jerusalem, about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>They, therefore, being brought forward on their journey, by the congregation, went through Phenicia and Samaria, relating the conversion of the Gentiles; and they occasioned great joy to all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>And being arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the congregation, and by the Apostles and elders: and they related what things God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, rose up and said, that it was necessary to circumcise them, and to charge them to keep the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>And the Apostles and elders were gathered together to consult upon this affair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And after much debate, Peter rose up and said to them, Brethren, you know that, some considerable time since, God among us, chose, that the Gentiles, by my mouth, should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as he did to us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>and made no distinction between us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>Now, therefore, why do you tempt God by imposing on the neck of the disciples a yoke which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>But we believe that we are saved by the grace of the Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>And the whole multitude kept silence, and attended to Barnabas and Paul; relating what signs and wonders God had done among the heathen, by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>Then after they had done speaking, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon has been relating how God first looked down on the Gentiles, to take from among them a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And the words of the prophets harmonize with this; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>«After this, I will return, and will rebuild the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; yes, I will rebuild its ruins, and set it upright again:»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>that the remainder of men may seek the Lord, even all the heathen upon whom my name is called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>«says the Lord,» 'who does all these things, known to him from the beginning.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>Wherefore, my judgment is not to disquiet those who, from among the Gentiles, are converted to God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but to write to them, that they abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from that which is strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>For Moses has, from ancient generations, those who preach him, in every city, being read in the synagogues every Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it seemed good to the Apostles and elders, and all the congregation, to send to Antioch, with Paul and Barnabas, chosen men from among themselves, namely, Judas, surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, men of principal account among the brethren;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>writing by their hands these things: The Apostles, and elders, and brethren, to the brethren from among the Gentiles in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia, greeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>Forasmuch as we have been informed that, some going out from among us, to whom we gave no commission, have troubled you with discourses, unsettling your minds, saying, that you must be circumcised, and keep the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>we, being unanimously assembled, have thought proper to send you chosen men, with out beloved Barnabas and Paul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men that have exposed their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have, therefore, sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you by word of mouth, the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to impose no further burden upon you besides these necessary things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>that you abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from anything strangled, and from fornication: from which you will do well to keep yourselves. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>They, therefore, being dismissed, came to Antioch; and assembling the multitude, delivered the epistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>And when they had read it, they rejoiced for the consolation it brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>And Judas and Silas, being also prophets themselves; in a copious discourse, exhorted and strengthened the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>And, having made some stay, they were dismissed with peace from the brethren to the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>But Silas thought proper to continue there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>Paul also, and Barnabas, with many others, continued at Antioch; teaching and declaring the good word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>And, after some days, Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and visit the brethren in all the cities in which we have published the word of the Lord; and see how they do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>And Barnabas determined to take along with them John, surnamed Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Peter did not think proper to take with them that person who had withdrawn himself from them from Pamphylia; and went not with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>There was, therefore, a sharp fit of anger, so that they separated from each other; and Barnabas, taking Mark along with him, sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>But Paul made choice of Silas, and departed; being commended to the grace of God, by the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>And he went through Syria and Cilicia confirming the congregations;</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>and came to Derbe and Lystra; and, behold, a certain disciple was there, whose name was Timothy, the son of a believing Jewess, but of a Grecian father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>who had an honorable character given by the brethren in Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Him Paul would have to go forth with him: and took and circumcised him, on account of the Jews who were in those places: for they all knew his father, that he was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they passed through the cities, they delivered to their custody the decrees, which were determined by the Apostles and elders that were at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>The congregations, therefore, were confirmed in the faith, and increased in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>And they went through Phrygia, and the region of Galatia, and being forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>when they were come to Mysia, they attempted to go to Bithynia; but the spirit did not permit them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>And passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There stood a certain Macedonia, entreating him, and saying, Come over to Macedonia, and help us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>And as soon as he had seen this vision, we immediately endeavored to go to Macedonia; assuredly inferring, that the Lord had called us to declare the gospel to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Setting sail, therefore, from Troas, we ran directly to Samothracia; and the next day to Neapolis;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and came thence to Philippi, which is a city of the first part of Macedonia, a colony: and we continued in this city for some days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>And on the Sabbath day we went out of the city to the side of the river, according to the custom, where was an oratory; and sitting down, we spoke to the women that were assembled there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, a worshiper of God, heard the discourse: whose heart the Lord opened to attend to the things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And when she was immersed, with her family, she entreated us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, enter into my house, and continue there. And she compelled us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>Now it came to pass, that as we were going to the oratory, we were met by a certain maid-servant that had a spirit of divination, who brought her owners much gain by prophesying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>the same, following after Paul and us, cried out, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who declare to you the way of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And this she did for several days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I charge you, in the name of Jesus Christ, to go out of her. And it went out that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>But when her owners saw that the hope of their gain was gone; laying hold of Paul and Silas, they dragged them to the market place, to the magistrates:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>and having brought them to the generals of the army, they said, These men, who are Jews, mightily disturb our city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and teach customs, which it is not lawful for us to receive and practice, being Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the populace rose up together against them; and the generals tearing off their garments, commanded them to be beaten with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast them into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>Who, having received such a strict charge, threw them into the inner prison, and secured their feet fast in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>But at midnight, Paul and Silas having prayed, sung a hymn to God: and the prisoners heard them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>And, on a sudden, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prisoner were shaken: and immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all the prisoners were loosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>And the jailor, awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the doors of the prison opened, drew his sword, and was going to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners were fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul cried out, with a loud voice, saying, Do yourself no harm, for we are all here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>And he called for lights, and sprung in; and, being in a tremor, fell down before Paul and Silas;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and, bringing them out, he said, O Sirs, what must I do to be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, and your house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And taking them, that very hour of the night, he washed their stripes; and was immediately immersed, himself, and all his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And having brought them into his house, he spread the table before them: and believing in the God, with all his house, he was transported with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Dismiss those men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the keeper of the prison told these things to Paul, The generals have sent that you may be dismissed; now, therefore, go out, and pursue your journey in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, They have beaten us, who are Romans, publicly and uncondemned, and have cast us into prison; and do they now thrust us out privately? By no means: but let them come themselves, and conduct us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the sergeants reported these words to the generals. And when they had heard that they were Romans, they were afraid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>and they came and comforted them; and conducting them out, requested that they would depart from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And coming out of the prison, they entered into the house of Lydia: and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>And taking their journey through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica; where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>And according to Paul's custom, he entered in among them, and discoursed to them for three Sabbaths from the scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>opening them, and evidently showing that the Messiah ought to suffer, and to rise from the dead; and that this is the Messiah, even Jesus, whom I declare to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And some of them believed, and adhered to Paul and Silas; besides, a considerable number of the devout Greeks, and not a few of the principal women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the unbelieving Jews, filled with zeal, gathered together some mean and profligate fellows, and making a mob, threw the city into a tumult; and assaulting the house of Jason, endeavored to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>But not finding them, they dragged Jason, and some of the brethren to the magistrates of the city, crying out, These men, that have turned the world upside down, are come hither, also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>and Jason has privately received them. And all these men act contrary to the decrees of Cesar, saying that there is another king, one Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And they alarmed the multitude and the magistrates of the city, when they heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>And having taken security of Jason, and the rest, they dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>But the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas, by night, to Berea: and when they came thither, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>Now these were of a more noble disposition that those of Thessalonica: for they received the word with all readiness of mind, daily examining the scriptures, whether those things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Many of them, therefore, believed; both of the Grecian women of considerable rank, and of the men not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But as soon as some of the Jews of Thessalonica understood that the word of God was announced by Paul at Berea, they came thither, also, exciting the populace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul, as if he were to go by sea. But Silas and Timothy continued there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And they that conducted Paul, brought him as far as Athens: and having received an order for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him as soon as possible, they set out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>Now, while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit within him was strongly moved when he beheld the city enslaved to idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>He therefore reasoned with the Jews and proselytes in the synagogue; and in the forum, daily, with those who met with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>Then some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers opposed him. Others said, What would this babbler say? And others, he seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities; because he declared to them the good news concerning Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And they took him and conducted him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new doctrine is, which is spoken by you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>for you bring some strange things to our ears; we would, therefore, know what these things mean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>For all the Athenians, and the strangers that sojourned among them spent their leisure in nothing else but in telling or hearing news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Paul, therefore, standing up in the middle of Areopagus, said, Athenians, I perceive that you are exceedingly addicted to the worship of demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For, as I passed along, and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription, To the Unknown God: Him, therefore, you ignorantly worship, I announce to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God who made the world, and all things that are in it, being the Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>Neither is he served by human hands, as if he stood in need of anything; he himself giving to all, life, and breath, and all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And he has made of one blood, the whole race of men, to inhabit all the face of the earth; having marked out the times previously arranged in order, and the boundaries of their habitations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they might seek after the Lord, if possibly they might feel after him, and find him; though he be not far from every one of us:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>«for in him we live, and are moved, and do exist; as some of your own poets have said-For we his offspring are.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>We, therefore, being the offspring of God, ought not to imagine the Deity to be like gold, or silver, or stone, wrought by the art and contrivance of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>For though God overlooked the times of ignorance, he now makes proclamation to all men, everywhere, to reform;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because he has appointed a day, in which he will judge the world righteously, by that Man whom he has ordained: of which he has given assurance to all men, by raising him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some made a jest of it, and others said, We will hear you again upon this subject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>And this Paul went out of the midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>Nevertheless, some men adhered to him, and believed: among whom was Dionysius, the Areopagite; also a woman, whose name was Damaris; and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After these things, Paul departed from Athens and came to Corinth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>and finding a certain Jews, named Aquila, a native of Pontus, lately come from Italy, with Priscilla, his wife, (because Claudius Cesar had commanded all the Jews to depart from Rome,) he went to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>And as he was of the same trade, he continued with them, and wrought; for by trade they were tent-makers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>But he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath day, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And as soon as Silas and Timothy came from Macedonia, Paul was impelled by the Spirit, and testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But when they set themselves in opposition, and reviled, he shook his garment, and said to them, Let your blood be upon your own head! I am pure. From henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And going out thence, he went into the house of one called Justus, a worshiper of God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>Now, Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, with all his house; and many of the Corinthians, hearing, believed; and were immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>But the Lord said to Paul, in a vision by night, Fear not, but speak, and do not keep silence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>for I am with you, and no man shall fall on you, to injure you; for I have much people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>And he continued there a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made an assault upon Paul, with one consent, and brought him before the tribunal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, This fellow persuades men to worship God contrary to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>And when Paul would have opened his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were an act of injustice, or mischievous licentiousness, O Jews! it were reasonable I should bear with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But if it be a question concerning words, and names, and the law which is among you, you see to it yourselves; for I will be no judge of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them away from the tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>And all the Greeks laid hold on Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him before the tribunal; but Gallio did not concern himself at all about the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And Paul still continued there for a considerable time, and then taking leave of the brethren, sailed thence for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila; having shaved his head at Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And he arrived at Ephesus, and there he left them; but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>And though they entreated him to have staid longer with them, he did not consent:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but he took his leave of them, saying, It is necessary for me, all means, to celebrate the approaching feast at Jerusalem; but I will return to you again, God willing. And he set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And landing at Caesarea, he went up; and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>and having saluted the congregation, he went down to Antioch. And having spent some time there, he departed, going through the country of Galatia and Phrygia, in a regular manner confirming all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Now, a certain Jew, whose name was Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, and powerful in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This person was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught them things of the Lord with great accuracy, being only acquainted with the immersion of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And Aquila and Priscilla hearing him, took him aside, and explained to him the way of God in a more perfect manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he intended to go over to Achaia, the brethren wrote to the disciples, exhorting them to receive him. And being arrived there, by his gift he greatly helped those who had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he strenuously debated with the Jews in public, showing by the scriptures, that Jesus is the Messiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>Now it came to pass, that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul, having passed through the upper parts, came to Ephesus: and finding there some disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>he said to them, Have you, on your believing, received the Holy Spirit? And they replied to him, No; we have not so much as heard whether the Holy Spirit is received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>And he said to them, Into what, then, were you immersed? And they said, Into John's immersion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>And Paul said, John, indeed, administered the immersion of reformation, telling the people that they should believe in Him that was to come after him: that is, in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And hearing this, they were immersed into the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And Paul, laying his hands, on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them; and they spoke with tongues, and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>And they were, in all, about twelve men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>And he went into the synagogue, and discoursed with boldness, disputing for the space of three months, and evincing the things which related to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But as some were hardened, and would not believe, speaking reproachfully of this way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this was done for the space of two years, so that all the inhabitants of Asia, both Jews and Greeks, heard the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God wrought extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that handkerchiefs, or aprons, were carried from his body to those who were sick, and the diseases removed from them, and the evil spirits came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>And some of the strolling Jews, who were exorcists, undertook to name the name of the Lord Jesus, over those who had evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>And there were seven sons of one Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the evil spirit answering, said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom the evil spirit was, sprung upon them, and getting master of them prevailed against them, so that they fled out of the house, naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this was known to all the Jews, and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many of them, who believed, came and confessed, and made a declaration of their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>And a considerable number of those who had curious arts, bringing their books together, burnt them before all: and they computed the value of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>so powerfully did the word of the Lord grow, and prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>Now when these things were fulfilled, Paul proposed in spirit, that, passing through Macedonia and Achaia, he would go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, it is necessary for me also to see Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And sending two of those that ministered to him, Timothy and Erastus, into Macedonia, he himself staid some time in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>And there happened, about that time, no small tumult concerning that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a man whose name was Demetrius, a silversmith, by making silver shrines of Diana, procured no small gain to the artificers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>whom he gathered together, with the workmen employed about the business, and said, Men, you know that our maintenance arises from this manufacture;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>and you see and hear that this Paul has persuaded great numbers of people, not only of Ephesus, but almost of all Asia, and has turned them aside, saying that they are not deities which are made with hands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>so that there is danger, not only that this occupation of ours should be depreciated, but also that the people of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her grandeur destroyed; whom all Asia and the world worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And hearing this, they were filled with rage; and cried out, saying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the whole city was filled with confusion; and they rushed with one accord into the theater, dragging thither Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, Paul's fellow-travelers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>And when Paul would have gone in to the people, the disciples would not permit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And some, too, the principal officers of Asia, as they had a friendship for him, sent to him, and desired that he would not venture himself into the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Some, therefore, were crying one thing, and some another; for the congregation was confused, and the greater part did not know for what they were come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And they thrust forth forward Alexander, from amongst the multitude, the Jews urging him on. And Alexander, beckoning with his hand, would have made a defense to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they knew that he was a Jew, one voice arose from them all, crying out, for about the space of two hours, Great is Diana of the Ephesians!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>But the chancellor, having pacified the people, said Ephesians, what man is there that does not know that the city of the Ephesians is devoted to the great Diana, and to the image that fell down from Jupiter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Since, then, these things are incontestable, it is necessary for you to be quiet, and to do nothing in a precipitate manner;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>for you have brought these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor blasphemers of your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>If, therefore, Demetrius, and the artificers that are with him, have a charge against any one, courts are held; and there are the proconsuls; let them implead together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if you are inquiring anything concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a legal congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>And, indeed, we are in danger of being called in question for the insurrection which has happened this day, as there is no cause by which we can account for this concourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>And when he had said these things, he dismissed the congregation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>Now, after the tumult was ceased, Paul, calling the disciples to him: and embracing them, departed to go into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And going through those parts, and having exhorted them with much discourse, he came into Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>And when he had continued there three months, as an ambush was laid for him by the Jews, when he was about to embark for Syria, he thought it advisable to return by Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And Sopater, the Berean, accompanied him as far as Asia; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius, of Derbe, and Timothy: and of the Asiatics, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These, going before, staid for us at Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>And we set sail from Philippi, after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas in five days, where we continued seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And on the first day of the week, when the disciples met together to break bread, Paul, being about to depart on the morrow, discoursed to them, and continued his speech until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>And there were many lamps in the upper room, in which we were assembled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>and a certain young man, whose name was Eutychus, sitting in a window, fell into a profound sleep: and as Paul continued his discourse a long time, he was so overpowered with sleep that he fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>And Paul went down, and fell upon him, and taking him in his arms, said, Do not make any disturbance, for his life is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>And going up again, and having broken bread, and eaten, he conversed a considerable time, even till break of day, and so departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they brought the youth alive, and were not a little comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>But we went before into the ship, and sailed to Assos, where we are to take up Paul, for so he had appointed, choosing himself to go on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>And as soon as he joined us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>And sailing thence, we came the next day over against Chios; and the day following, we touched at Samos, and having staid at Trogyllium, we came the day after to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not spend any time in Asia; for he earnestly endeavored, if it were possible for him, to be at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>But, sending to Ephesus, from Miletus, he called thither the elders of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And when they were come to him, he said to them, You know how I have been conversant among you all the time, from the first day in which I entered into Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord, with all humility, and with tears, and trials which befell me by the ambushes of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>and how I have suppressed nothing that was advantageous, not neglecting to announce to you, and to teach you publicly and privately;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>testifying both to the Jews and Greeks, reformation with respect to God, and faith with respect to our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, bound by the Spirit, not knowing the things that shall befall me there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>except that the Holy Spirit testifies in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I make no account of any of these things, nor do I regard even life itself; so that I may but joyfully finish my course, and the ministry which I have received of the Lord Jesus, even to testify the good news of the favor of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And now, behold, I know that you all, with whom I have conversed, proclaiming the kingdom of God, shall not see my face any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>Wherefore, I testify to you this day, that I am clear from the blood of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>For I have not declined to declare to you all the counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Therefore, take heed to yourselves, and to the whole flock over which the Holy Spirit has constituted you overseers; to feed the congregation of the Lord, which he has redeemed with his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>For I know this, that after my departure, grievous wolves will enter in among you, having no mercy on the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>Yes, from among your own selves men shall arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>Watch, therefore, remembering that for the space of three years, I ceased not to warn every one, night and day, with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>And now, brethren, I recommend you to God, and to the word of his favor, who is able to edify you, and to give you an inheritance among all that are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>I have coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>Yes, you yourselves know, that these hands ministered to my necessities, and to those that were with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>I have showed you all things; how, that thus laboring, you ought to assist the infirm, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is much happier to give than to receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And having said these things, he kneeled down and prayed with them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And there was great lamentation among them all: and falling upon Paul's neck, they kissed him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>especially grieving for that word which he spoke, that they should see his face no more. And they conducted him to the ship.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>Now, as soon as we had withdrawn from them, and had set sail, we came with a direct course to Coos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from thence to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>And finding a ship passing over Phenicia, we went aboard, and set sail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>And coming within sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on the left hand, we sailed to Syria, and landed at Tyre; for there the ship was to unload its freight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And we continued there several days, finding disciples, who told Paul, by the Spirit, not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>But when we had finished these seven days, we departed, and went our way, and they all attended us out of the city, with their wives and children; and, kneeling down on the seashore, we prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>And having embraced each other, we went on board the ship; and they returned back to their own houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And finishing our course, we came from Tyre to Ptolemais, and embracing the brethren, we continued with them one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>And on the next day we departed, and came to Caesarea, and entering into the house of Philip, the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we lodged with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>Now he had four virgin daughters, who were prophetesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And as we continued there many days, a certain prophet, whose name was Agabus, came down from Judea:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>and coming to us, he took up Paul's girdle, and binding his own hands and feet, he said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man whose girdle this is, and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>And when we heard these things, both we, and the inhabitants of that place, entreated him, that he would not go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>But Paul answered, What do you mean, thus weeping, and breaking my heart? for I am ready, not only to be bound; but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased; saying, The will of the Lord be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>And after these days, making up our baggage, we went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>And some of the disciples also from Caesarea, went along with us, and brought us to one Mnason, a Cyprian, and old disciple, with whom we should lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>And when we were arrived at Jerusalem, the brethren received us with pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>And the next day Paul entered in with us to James; and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And having embraced them, he gave them a particular account of those things which God had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And when they heard it, they glorified God, and said to him, Brother, you see how many myriads of believing Jews there are: and they are all zealous for the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>Now, they have been informed of you, that you teach all the Jews, which are among the Gentiles, to apostatize from Moses, saying, that they ought not to circumcise their children, nor to walk according to the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What is it then? The multitude must, by all means, come together; for they will hear that you are come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Therefore, do this that we say to you: there are with us four men who have a vow upon them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>take them, and purify yourself with them, and be at charges for them, that they may shave their heads: and all will know that there is nothing in those things which they have heard of you; but that you yourself walk regularly, keeping the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>As for the believing Gentiles, we have written, determining that they should observe none of these things; except it be to keep themselves from what is offered to idols, and from blood, and from that which is strangled, and from fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took the men, and the next day, being purified with them, entered into the temple, declaring the accomplishment of the days of purification, till an offering should be offered for every one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>But as the seven days were about to be accomplished, the Jews that were from Asia, seeing him in the temple, threw all the populace into confusion, and laid hands upon him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying out, Israelites, help! This is the man that everywhere teaches all men contrary to the people, and to the law, and to this place; and has even brought Greeks into the temple, and polluted this holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>(For they had been seen Trophimus, the Ephesian, in the city with him, whom they imagined that Paul had brought into the temple.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of the people; and laying hold of Paul, they dragged him out of the temple: and immediately the gates were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And when they went about to kill him, word was brought to the commander of the cohort, that all Jerusalem was in confusion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>who immediately took soldiers, and centurions, and ran in among them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they ceased from beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the commander drew near, and took him; and ordered him to be bound with two chains, and inquired who he was, and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>And some among the multitude cried out one thing, and some another: and as he could not know the certainty, by reason of the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>But when he was upon the stairs, it came to pass that he was borne by the soldiers, because of the violence of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>For the multitude of the people followed, crying out, Away with him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>But as Paul was going to be brought into the castle, he said to the commander, May I be allowed to speak to you? And he said, Can you speak Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Are you not that Egyptian, who did, before these days, stir up a sedition, and led out into the wilderness four thousand murderers?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, I am indeed a Jew, of Tarsus, in Cilicia, a citizen of no inconsiderable city; and I entreat you, permit me to speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And on his giving permission, Paul standing on the stairs, beckoned with his hand to the people; and when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, saying:</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Brethren and fathers, hear my apology, which I make to you now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And when they heard, that he addressed them in the Hebrew dialect, they rather kept silence;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>and he said, I am, indeed, a Jew, born at Tarsus, in Cilicia, but educated in this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, accurately instructed in the law of our fathers; being zealous for God, as you all are at this day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>who persecuted this way to the death; binding both men and women, and delivering them into prisons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as also the high priest is my witness, and all the national senate: from whom also having received letters to the brethren, I went to Damascus; to bring those that were there bound, to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>And it came to pass, that as I was on my journey, and was come nigh to Damascus, about noon, on a sudden a great light from heaven shone about me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>and I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>But I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>And they that were with me saw the light, indeed, and were terrified; but they did not distinctly hear the voice of him that spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And I said, Lord, what shall I do? And the Lord said to me, Arise, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told you of all things, which are appointed for you to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And as I could not see, by reason of the glory of that light; being led by those that were with me, I came to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And one Ananias, a pious man according to the law, who had an honorable character amongst all the Jews at Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>coming to me, and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And in that very hour, I looked up on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, The God of our fathers, has chosen you to know his will, and to see that righteous person, and to hear a voice from his mouth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>because you shall be his witness, to all men, of those things, which you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now, why do you delay? Arise, and be immersed, and wash away your sins, invoking his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And it came to pass, that when I was returned to Jerusalem, and was praying in the temple, I was in a trance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and I saw him, saying to me, Make haste, and depart quickly from Jerusalem; for they will not receive your testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, Lord, they know I was imprisoning, and scourging in the synagogues, them that believed in thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>and when the blood of Stephen thy martyr was shed, I also was standing by, and consenting, and kept the garments of those who slew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And he said to me, Go your way, for I will send you afar off to the Gentiles-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they heard him to this word, and they lifted up their voices, saying, Away with this fellow from the earth, for it is not fit that he should live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they were crying out, and were rending their garments, and casting dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the commander ordered that he should be brought into the castle, saying, that he should be put to the question by scourging, that he might know for what cause, they raised such an outcry against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as they binding him with thongs, Paul said to the centurion, who stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man, who is Roman, and uncondemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And the centurion hearing this, went and addressed the commander, saying, What are you about to do? for this man is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>And the commander came, and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman? And he said, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>And the commander answered, I obtained this freedom with a considerable sum of money. And Paul replied, But I was free born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>They, therefore, who were about to have put him to the question, immediately departed from him: and the commander was afraid, when he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>And on the next day, desiring to know certainly of what he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him; and commanded the chief priests, and all the Sanhedrim, to come together; and bringing Paul down, he set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paul, looking attentively on the Sanhedrim, said, Brethren, I have, even to this day, lived in all good conscience toward God-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And Ananias, the high priest, commanded those that stood by him, to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said to him, God is about to strike you, you whited wall! For do you sit to judge me according to the law, and yet, in violation of the law, command me to be struck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>But they, that stood by, said, Do you revile the high priest of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>«And Paul said, Brethren, I was not aware that it was the high priest; for it is written,» 'You shall not speak evil of the ruler of your people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>Then Paul, perceiving that the one part was Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, cried out, in the Sanhedrim, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee; for the hope and resurrection of the dead, I am brought into judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And on speaking this, there was a contention between the Pharisees and the Sadducees; and the multitude was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there was a great clamor; and the scribes who were on the side of the Pharisees, arose and contended, saying, We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit, or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And as a great disturbance arose, the commander, fearing lest Paul should be torn in pieces by them, ordered the soldiers to go down, and take him by force from the midst of them, and to bring him into the castle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And in the following night, the Lord, standing by him, said, Be of good courage, Paul; for as you have testified the things concerning me in Jerusalem, so you must also bear testimony in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And when it was day, some of the Jews, entering into a conspiracy, bound themselves with a curse; saying, that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And they were more than forty, who had made this agreement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves m by a solemn anathema, not to taste anything till we have slain Paul:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>now, therefore, do you, with the Sanhedrim, signify to the commander, that he bring him down to you, as if you would more accurately discuss what relates to him; and we are ready to kill him, before he can come near you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But Paul's sister's son, hearing of the ambush, came, and entering into the castle, told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paul, calling one of the centurions to him, said, Conduct this young man to the commander, for he has something to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>He, therefore, took and led him to the commander, and said, Paul, the prisoner, calling me to him, desired that I would bring to you this young man, who has something to tell you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the commander, taking him by the hand, and leading him into a retired place, inquired of him, What is it that you have to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, The Jews have agreed together to ask you, that you bring down Paul to-morrow to the Sanhedrim, as if they would inquire something more accurately concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>But do not be prevailed on by them; for there are more than forty of them, that lie in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by a curse, neither to eat nor drink, till they have killed him; and they are now ready, expecting this promise from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>The commander, therefore, dismissed the young man, with a charge, Be sure you tell no man, that you have discovered these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And he called too him two of the centurions, and said, Prepare two hundred soldiers, to go to Caesarea; and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen; by the third hour of the night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>and provide beasts to set Paul upon, and conduct him in safety to Felix, the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote an epistle, the contents of which are in this copy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias, to his excellency, Felix, the governor, sends greeting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man was seized by the Jews, and had like to have been slain by them; when I came with a party of soldiers, and rescued him: and I have since learned, that he is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And, desiring to know the crime of which they accused him, I brought him before the Sanhedrim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>whom I found to be accused concerning questions of their law, but to have nothing charged upon him worthy of death, or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>But when it was signified to me, that an ambush would be laid for the man, by the Jews, I immediately sent him to you, commanding his accusers also to declare before you, what they have against him. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>The soldiers, therefore, as it was commanded them, taking up Paul, brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>And the next day they returned to the castle, leaving the horsemen to go with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>who, entering into Caesarea, and delivering the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And when he had read the letter, he asked of what province he was: and being informed that he was of Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>I will hear you, said he, when your accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's praetorium.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And, after five days, the high, Ananias, came down, with the elders, and a certain orator, named Tertullus: and they made their appearance before the governor, against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And he being called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, As we enjoy great peace by your means, and as illustrious deeds are happily done to this nation, by your prudent administration;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>we accept it always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But, that I may not further trouble you, I beseech you to hear us briefly, with your usual candor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>for we have found this man a pestilent fellow, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the world; and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>who has attempted to profane the temple; and whom we apprehended, and would have judged according to our law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>but Lysias, the commander, coming upon us with a great force, took him away out of our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>commanding his accusers to come to you; by which means, you may yourself, on examination, know the certainty of all these things, of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also gave their assent, saying, that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>Then Paul, after the governor had made a signal to him to speak, answered, Knowing that you, O Felix! have been for several years a judge to this nation, I answer for myself with the more cheerfulness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>since you may know that it is no more than twelve days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>and they neither found me disputing with any man in the temple, nor making any insurrection among the people, either in the synagogues, or in the city:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>nor can they produce any proof of the things concerning which they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But this I confess to you, that after the way which they call a sect, so worship I the God of our fathers; believing all things which are written in the law, and in the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>having hope toward God, of that which they themselves also expect, that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and of the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>And upon this account, I exercise myself to have always a conscience without offense toward God, and toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>Now, after several years, I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>upon which some Asiatic Jews found me purified in the temple; neither with multitude nor with tumult;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>who ought to have been present before you, and to accuse me, if they had anything against me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>or let these themselves say, if, when I stood before the Sanhedrim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>they found any crime in me; unless it be with relation to this one word, which I expressed, when I stood among them-that, for the resurrection of the dead, I am judged by you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>And when Felix heard these things, he put them off, saying, After I have been more accurately informed concerning this way, when Lysias, the commander, comes down, I will take cognizance of the affair between you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and let him have liberty, and to hinder none of his friends from assisting him, or coming to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And, after some days, Felix, coming the Drusilla his wife, who was a Jewess, sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And he reasoned concerning righteousness and temperance, and judgment to come, Felix, trembling, answered, Go your way for this time, and I will take some future opportunity to call for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>And he hoped, also, that money would be given him by Paul, that he might be set at liberty: and, therefore, he sent the more frequently for him, and discoursed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>Now, after two years were ended, Felix was succeeded by Portius Festus; and Felix, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, left Paul a prisoner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>When Festus, therefore, was come into the province, after three days, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>and the high priest, and the chief among the Jews, appeared before him against Paul, and entreated him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>that he would send for him to Jerusalem; laying an ambush to kill him by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would shortly set out for that place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>therefore, said he, Let those of you who are able, go down with me; and if there be anything criminal in this man, let them accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And, having continued among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea; and the next day, sitting down on the tribunal, he commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he appeared, the Jews, who came down from Jerusalem, stood round about, bringing many heavy accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>while he answered for himself-Neither against the laws of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Cesar, have I committed any offense at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, willing to ingratiate himself with the Jews, answered Paul, and said, Will you go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged before me, concerning these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul said, I am standing at Cesar's tribunal, where I ought to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as you know perfectly well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>For, if, indeed, I have done wrong, or have committed anything worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if there is no fact of which they accuse me, no man can give me up to gratify them! I appeal to Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, having spoken with the council, answered, Have you appealed to Cesar? To Cesar you shall go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And when some days were passed, King Agrippa, and Bernice, came to Caesarea, to pay their respects to Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And as they continued there many days, Festus laid before the king the case of Paul, saying, There is a certain man, left in bonds by Felix;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews, informed me, desiring judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To whom I answered, that it is not the custom of the Romans to give up any man, till he that is accused have the accusers face to face, and be allowed an opportunity of making his defense, as to the crime laid to his charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>When, therefore, they were come hither, I, without any delay, sat down on the tribunal next day, and commanded the man to be brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>Against whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought no charge of such things as I supposed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but had certain questions against him, relating to their own religion, and about one Jesus, that was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>But as I was dubious of the question relating to him, I said, that if he were willing, he should go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But Paul, appealing to be kept to the hearing of his majesty, I commanded him to be kept till I could send him to Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Then Agrippa said to Festus, I also would willingly hear the man myself. And he said, To-morrow you shall hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>The next day, therefore, Agrippa and Bernice, coming with great pomp, and entering into the place of audience, with the commanders and principal men of the city; at the command of Festus, Paul was brought forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all you who are present with us! you see this man, concerning whom all the multitude of the Jews have pleaded with me, both at Jerusalem, and here, crying out that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But I could not apprehend him to have done anything worthy of death; yet, as he himself has appealed to his majesty, I have determined to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>Concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my master: wherefore, I have brought him out before you all; and especially before you, King Agrippa! that, after examination taken, I may have something to write:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>for it seems to me absurd, to send a prisoner, and not to signify the crimes alleged against him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, It is granted to you to speak for yourself. Then Paul, stretching forth his hand, made his defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>I esteem myself happy, King Agrippa, that I am this day to make my defense before you, concerning all those things of which I am accused by the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>especially as you are acquainted with all the customs and questions among the Jews: wherefore, I entreat you, that you will hear me with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>The manner of my life, from my youth, which, from the beginning, was spent among my own nation, in Jerusalem, is known to all the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>who knew me from the first, (if they would testify,) that, according to the strictest sect of our religion, I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now I stand in judgment for the hope of that promise, which was made by God to our fathers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>to which promise, our twelve tribes, worshiping continually, night and day, hope to attain: concerning which hope, King Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why should it be judged an incredible thing, by you, that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>I, indeed, thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus, the Nazarene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>Which, accordingly, I did in Jerusalem; and I shut up many of the saints in prison, having received authority from the chief priests. And when some of them were killed, I gave my vote against them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>and frequently punishing them in all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme: and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>With this view, I was going to Damascus, with authority and commission from the chief priests;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at mid-day, on the road, King Agrippa, I saw a light from heaven, exceeding the splendor of the sun, shining about me, and those who traveled with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And when we were all fallen down to the earth, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying, in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But arise, and stand upon your feet, for to this purpose I have appeared to you, to ordain you a minister and a witness, both of the things which you have seen, and of those which I will hereafter show you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles; to whom I now send you-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes, to turn them from darkness to light, and from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God; that they may receive forgiveness of sons, and an inheritance amongst the sanctified, through faith in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>From that time, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but declared, first to them at Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and through all the country of Judea; and then to the Gentiles, that they should reform, and return to God, performing deeds worthy of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>On account of these things, the Jews seizing me in the temple, attempted to have killed me with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Having, therefore, obtained help from God, I continue, till this day, testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses have declared would be;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the Messiah would be a sufferer-would be first of a resurrection from the dead-would give light to the people, and to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And as he was thus making his defense, Festus said, with a loud voice, Paul, you are distracted: much learning drives you to madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But he replied, I am not mad, most noble Festus, but utter the words of truth and soberness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king knows of these things; to whom, also, I speak with freedom: for I am persuaded none of these things are hid from him, for this was not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa! do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, You almost persuade me to be a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul said, I would to God that, not only you, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am, except these chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And as he said this, the king arose, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>And when they had retired, they spoke one with another, saying, This man has done nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed to Cesar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And as it was determined that we should set sail into Italy, they delivered Paul, and some other prisoners, to a centurions of the Augustan Band, whose name was Julius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And going on board a ship of Adramyttis, we weighed anchor, intending to sail by the coasts of Asia; Aristarchus, a Macedonian, of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>And the next day we reached Sidon: and Julius, treating Paul with great humanity, permitted him to go to his friends, and to enjoy the benefit of their care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And weighing anchor thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And sailing through the sea over against Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, a city of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And there, the centurion, finding a ship of Alexandria, bound for Italy, put us on board of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And when we had sailed slowly for several days, and were hardly got over against Cnidus, the wind now permitting us; we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>and passing it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called the Fair Havens, in the neighborhood of which, was the city of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And, as much time was spent, and sailing was now hazardous, because the fast was already over, Paul exhorted them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>saying to them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be attended with injury and great damage, not only to the lading and to the ship, but also to our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion paid greater regard to the pilot, and the master of the vessel, than to those things which were spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And as the haven was not commodious to winter in, the greater part advised to set sail from thence, if they might possibly reach Phenice, to winter there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>which is a haven of Crete, looking to the southwest and northwest: and as the south win blew gently, supposing they were secure of their purpose, they weighed anchor, and sailed on close to Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long after, there arose against her a tempestuous wind, which is called Euroclydon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>And as the ship was violently hurried away, and was not able to bear up against the wind, we gave her up, and were driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>An running under a certain island, called Clauda, we were hardly able to get masters of the boat:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>which, when they had hoisted up, they used helps, undergirding the ship: and fearing, lest they should fall upon the quicksands, they struck sail, and so were driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And we were exceedingly tossed by the storm, the next day they lightened the ship:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>and the third day we cast out, with our own hands, the tackling of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>Now, as neither sun nor stars appeared for several days, and no small tempest pressed upon us, all remainder of hope that we might be delivered, was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>And when there was great want of food, then Paul, standing in the midst of them, said, Sirs, you ought to have hearkened to me, and not to have loosed from Crete, and incurred this injury and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>Nevertheless, even now I exhort you to be of good courage: for there shall be no loss of any life among you; but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For there appeared to me this night, an angel of the God whose I am, and whom I worship,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, Fear not, Paul; you must be presented before Cesar; and, behold, God has given you all them that sail with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Wherefore, take courage, men; for I trust in God that it shall be so, even as it was told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But we must be cast upon a certain island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>And when the fourteenth night was come, as we were tossed up and down in the Adriatic sea, the mariners suspected, about midnight that they drew near to some land;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>and sounding, they found it twenty fathoms: and having gone a little way from thence, and sounding again, they found it fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>And fearing lest they should fall upon some rocky shore, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished that the day would break.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>But when the mariners endeavored to flee out of the ship, and had let down the boat into the sea, under pretense that they were about to carry out anchors from the ship-head;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these continue in the ship, you can not be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut off the cords of the boat, and let it fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And while the day was coming on, Paul exhorted them all to take some food, saying, Today, whilst waiting for this fourteenth day, you continue fasting, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>I exhort you, therefore, to take a refreshment; for this is conducive to your safety: for not a hair shall fall from the head of any of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And when he had spoke thus, and had taken bread, he gave thanks to God, before them all; and having broken it, he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>And being all encouraged, they also took some food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>And we were in the ship, in all two hundred and seventy-six souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And being satisfied with food, they lightened the ship; and cast the corn into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when it was day, they did not know the land: but they perceived a certain creek, with a shore, into which they determined, if they were able, to force the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And having cut off the anchors, leaving them in the sea, they, at the same time, loosing the rudder bands, and hoisting up the mainsail to the wind, pressed toward the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But falling on a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground, and the fore part stuck fast, and remained immovable, while the hinder part was broken by the force of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the counsel of the soldiers was, that they should kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim away, and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, being desirous to save Paul, hindered them from their purpose, and commanded those that could swim, to throw themselves out first, into the sea, and get away to land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and the remainder, some upon planks, and others upon some of the things of the ship. And so it happened that they all got safe to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And being got safe to land, they then knew that the island was called Melita.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the barbarians treated us with uncommon humanity; for having kindled a fire, they brought us all to it, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Now, as Paul was gathering up a bundle of sticks, and laying them on the fire, a viper coming out of the heat, fastened upon his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And as soon as the barbarians saw the fierce animal hanging on his hand, they said one to another, This man is certainly a murderer, whom justice has not permitted to live, though he be saved from the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>But he, shaking off the fierce animal into the fire, suffered no evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>However, they expected that he should have swollen, or suddenly have fallen down dead: and having waited a considerable time, and seeing no mischief befall him, changing their minds, they said he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>And in the neighborhood of that place, there was the estate of the chief of the island, whose name was Publius; who, having received us into his house, entertained us in a courteous manner for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>And so it was, that the father of Publius, being seized with a fever and bloody flux, was confined to his bed: to whom Paul going in, and having prayed, laid his hands on him, and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>Now, therefore, when this miracle was wrought, the rest also, who had disorders, in the island, came, and were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>Who also honored us with great honors; and when we departed, put on board such things as were necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And after three months, we departed in a ship of Alexandria, that had wintered in the island, whose sign was Castor and Pollux.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And being arrived at Syracuse, we continued there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>From thence we coasted round, and came over against Rhegium. And after one day the south wind arising, we came, in two days, to Puteoli:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where we found brethren, and were entreated to stay with them seven days: and so we went for Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And from thence, the brethren, having heard of our affairs, came out to meet us, as far as Appii Forum, and the Three Taverns: whom, when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the captain of the band: but Paul was permitted to dwell apart, in a house of his own, with a soldier that guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And it came to pass, that, after three days, Paul called together those that were the chief of the Jews. And when they were come together, he said to them, Brethren, though I have done nothing contrary to the people, nor to our paternal customs, yet I was delivered a prisoner, from Jerusalem, into the hands of the Romans;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, having examined me, were willing to have set me at liberty, as there was no cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But when the Jews opposed, I was obliged to appeal to Cesar; not as having anything of which to accuse my own nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>For this reason, therefore, I entreated, that I might see and speak with you; for on account of the hope of Israel, I am bound with this chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said to him, We have neither received letters from Judea concerning you; nor have any of the brethren, that have come hither, related, or said, any evil concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we desire to hear from you, what you think; for as concerning this sect, we know that it everywhere spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And having appointed him a day, many came to him at his lodging; to whom he expounded, testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things that relate to Jesus; both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from morning till evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some were persuaded by the things which were spoken; and some believed not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And disagreeing with each other, they broke up the assembly: Paul saying this one word, Surely, well did the Holy Spirit speak, by Isaiah the prophet, to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>«when he said,» 'Go to this people and say, Hearing you will hear, and will not understand; and seeing you will see, and will not perceive:'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>«for the heart of this people is become gross, and with their ears they hear heavily; and they have drawn their eyes together, lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and should be converted, and I should heal them.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Therefore be it known to you, that the salvation of God is sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>And when he had said these things, the Jews departed, having great debates among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>But Paul continued two whole years in his own hired house, and received all who came to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>announcing the kingdom of God, and teaching those things which relate to the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom of speech, and without any restraint.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a servant of Jesus Christ, a called Apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>(which he formerly announced by his prophets, in the Sacred Writings,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord; descended from David, as to his flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>and constituted the Son of God, with power, as to his holy spiritual nature, after his resurrection from the dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>by whom we have received favor, even the apostolic office, for the obedience of faith among all nations, for his name's sake:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom are you, also, called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints; favor be to you, and peace from God our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First of all, I thank my God, through the Lord Jesus Christ, for you all, that your faith is published in all the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve sincerely in the gospel of his Son, that continually I make mention of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>always in my prayers, requesting that, by some means, now at length, I may have a prosperous journey, (God willing,) to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I greatly desire to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>and that I may be comforted, together with you, through the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now, brethren, I would not have you ignorant, that I often purposed to come to you, thought I have, as yet been hindered; that I might have some fruit among you also, even as among the other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am a debtor, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians; both to the wise and to the unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>Therefore, I am willing, according to my ability, to declare the glad tidings, even to you who are in Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel; because it is the power of God for salvation, to every one who believes; to the Jew first, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>«For in it the justification of God by faith is revealed, in order to faith; as it is written,» 'Now the just by faith, shall live.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>Besides the wrath of God is revealed from heaven, against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who suppress the truth by unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because that which may be known of God is manifest among them, for God has manifested it to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>(for his invisible attributes, even his eternal power and divinity, since the creation of the world, are very evident; being known by his works:) so that they are inexcusable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because, though they knew God, they did not glorify him as God, neither gave him thanks; but became foolish by their own reasonings, and their inconsiderate heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Professing to be wise men, they became fools:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>for they changed the glory of the immortal God into the likeness of an image of mortal man, of fowls, or four-footed beasts, and of reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore, also, God, through the lusts of their own hearts, delivered them over to uncleanness, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>Who changed the truth concerning God, into a lie, and worshiped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is forever blessed. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this, God delivered them over to shameful passions; for even their females changed the natural use unto what is contrary to nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>In like manner, also, the males, leaving the natural use of the female, burned in their lust toward one another, males with males, working out that which is shameful, and receiving in themselves that recompense of their error which was due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And as they did not like to acknowledge God, God delivered them over to an undiscerning mind, to work those things which are not suitable;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all injustice, fornication, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, bad habits, whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>revilers, haters of God, insolent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil pleasure, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>impudent, covenant breakers, without natural affection, implacable, unmerciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>Some, who clearly understand the law of God, (that they who practice such things are worthy of death,) not only do these things, but even commend those who practice them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Wherefore, you are inexcusable, O man! whosoever you are, who condemn: for in condemning another, you pass sentence upon yourself; because you, who condemn, practice the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>Besides, we know that the sentence of God is according to truth, upon them who commit such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>And do you think this, O man, who condemn those who practice such things, and yet do the same, that you shall escape the sentence of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you despise the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering; not acknowledging that the goodness of God invites you to a reformation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But according to your obdurate and impenitent heart, you treasure up to yourself wrath, against a day of wrath and revelation of the righteous judgment of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who will render to every one according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>eternal life, indeed, to them who, by perseverance in well-doing, seek glory, honor, and immortality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>but anger and wrath to them who are contentious, and obey not the truth, but obey unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>Affliction and great distress shall come upon every soul of man who works evil; first of the Jews, and also of the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>But glory, honor, and peace to every one who works good: first to the Jews, and also to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no respect of persons with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>As many, therefore, as have sinned without law, shall also perish without law; and as many as have sinned under law, shall be condemned by law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>for not those who hear the law are just before God; but those who obey the law, shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>When, therefore, the Gentiles, who have not a law, do by nature the things of the law, are a law to themselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>who show plainly the work of the law, written on their hearts; their conscience bearing witness, and also their reasonings between one another, when they accuse or excuse each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>In the day when God will judge the hidden things of men by Jesus Christ, according to my gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>If, now, you are called a Jew, and rest in the law, and boast in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know his will, and approve the things that are excellent, being instructed by the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and boast that you yourselves are a guide of the blind, a light of them who are in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>and instructor of the foolish, a teacher of babes, having the representation of knowledge and of truth in the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>you, then, who teach another; do you not teach yourself? You who proclaim, Do not steal; do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You who command, Do not commit adultery; do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols; do you rob temples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You who boast in the law; by the breaking of the law, do you dishonor God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>«For it is written,» 'The name of God is evil spoken of among the Gentiles, through you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>Now circumcision indeed profits, if you practice law; but if you be a transgressor of law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>And if the uncircumcision keep the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And will not the uncircumcision which by nature fulfills the law, condemn you, a transgressor of law, though in possession of the scriptures and circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly; neither is circumcision that which is outward in the flesh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in the spirit, not in the letter; whose praise is not from men, but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What is the pre-eminence of the Jew, then? or what profit is there of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much, in every respect: chiefly, indeed, because they were entrusted with the Oracles of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For, what if some did not believe-will not their unbelief destroy the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>«By no means. But let God be true, and every man a liar; as it is written,» 'That thou mayest be justified in thy sayings, and mayest overcome when thou judgest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness display the justice of God, what shall we say? Is not God unjust, who inflicts vengeance? (I speak after the manner of men.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>By no means: otherwise, how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>Still, if the truth of God has, through my lie, more abounded to his glory, why am I also yet condemned as a sinner-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>and not because we have done evil that good may come, as we are slandered, and as some affirm that we teach-whose condemnation is just?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Do we excel? Not at all. For we have before proved both Jews and Gentiles to be all under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>«As it is written,» 'Surely there is none righteous; no, not one.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none that understands; there is none that seeks after God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>They are all gone out of the way: they are together become unprofitable. There is none that does good; there is not so much as one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>Their throat is an open sepulcher: with their tongues they have used deceit; the poison of asps is under their lips:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>their mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet are swift to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Destruction and misery lurk in their paths;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>but the path of peace they have not known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>«There is no fear of God before their eyes.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that whatever things the law says, it says to them who are under the law: that every mouth may be stopped, and that all the world may be liable to punishment before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Wherefore, by works of law there shall no flesh be justified in his sight; because through law is the knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now, a justification which is of God, without law, is exhibited, attested by the law and the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>even a justification which is of God, through faith in Jesus Christ, for all, and upon all, who believe; for there is no difference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>For all, having sinned and come short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>are justified freely by his favor, through the redemption which is by Christ Jesus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God has set forth a propitiatory, through faith in his blood, for a demonstration of his own justice, in passing by the sins which were before committed, through the forbearance of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>for a demonstration, also, of his justice in the present time, in order that he may be just, when justifying him, who is of the faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where, then, is boasting? It is excluded. By what law? of works? No: but by the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>We conclude, then, that by faith man is justified, without works of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Is he the God of the Jews only, and not of the Gentiles, also? Yes, of the Gentiles, also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>Seeing there is one God, he will justify the circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcision through the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we, then, make law useless through the faith? By no means: but we establish law.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What do we then say that Abraham our father obtained by the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>for if Abraham were justified by works, he might boast; but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>«For what says the scripture?» 'And Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now, to him who works, the reward is not counted as a favor, but as a debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him who does not work, but believes on him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>In like manner, also, David describes the blessedness of the man to whom God counts righteousness without works: saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>«Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>«Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not count sin.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Does this blessedness come, then, on the circumcision only, or on the uncircumcision, also? for we affirm that faith was counted to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How, then, was it counted? when he was in circumcision, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness of the faith, which he had whilst uncircumcised; that he might be the father of all uncircumcised believers, that righteousness might be counted even to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>And a father to the circumcised, who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith of our father Abraham, which he had whilst in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise to Abraham, that he should be the heir of a world, was not to him, nor to his seed, through law; but through a righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of law are heirs; faith is rendered vain, and the promise is made of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>Farther, the law works out wrath; but where law is not, there is no transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>For this reason, it is through faith that it might be by favor, that the promise might be sure to all the seed: not to that only which is of the law; but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>«(as it is written,'Surely a father of many nations have I constituted you,') in the presence of him whom he believed, even of God, who makes alive the dead, and calls things which exist not, as though they existed.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>«He, contrary to hope, believed with hope, that he should be a father of many nations, according to what was spoken,» 'So shall your seed be.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And not being weak in faith, he did not consider his own body now dead, being about a hundred years old; neither the deadness of Sarah's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>Therefore, against the promise of God, through unbelief, he did not dispute; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>And was fully persuaded that what was promised, he was able to perform.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>Therefore, also, it was counted to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for his sake only, that it was so counted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>even to those who believe on him who raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered for our offenses, and was raised up again for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Wherefore, being justified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>through whom we have had introduction, also, by faith, into this favor in which we stand, and rejoice in the hope of the glory of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>and not only so, but we rejoice even in afflictions; knowing that affliction produces patience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and patience, approbation; and approbation, hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And this hope makes not ashamed: because the love of God is diffused in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, that is given us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>Besides, we being yet weak, in the appointed time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>Now, scarcely for a just man will one die, though for a good man one would, perhaps, even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God recommends his love to us; because, while we were yet sinner, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more, then, being now justified by his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, being enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son; much more, being reconciled, we shall be saved by his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only so, but we even rejoice in God, through our Lord Jesus Christ, though whom we have now received reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Wherefore, as sin entered into the world by one man, in whom all sinned, and by sin, death: thus death came upon all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>(For sin was in the world until the law: but sin is not imputed, when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over them who had not sinned, in the manner of Adam's transgression, who is a type of him that was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But not as the offense, so also is the free gift: for if by the offense of the one, the many died; much more the favor of God, and the gift by favor, which is of the one man, Jesus Christ, has abounded to the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And not as through one who sinner, is the free gift: for the sentence was from one to condemnation; but the free gift is from many offenses to justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by the offense of the one, death reigned by the one; much more shall they who receive the abundance of favor, and of the gift of justification, reign in life, by the one-Jesus Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>Now, therefore, as through one offense, the sentence came upon all men to condemnation: so, also, by one act of obedience, the sentence came upon all men to justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For, as through the disobedience of the one, the many were constituted sinners; so, by the obedience of the one, the many shall be constituted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>Moreover, the law supervened, that the offense might abound; but where sin abounded, favor superabounded-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>that as sin reigned by death, so, also, favor might reign by justification to eternal life, through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What do we say, then? Shall we continue in sin, that favor may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>By no means. How shall we, who have died to sin, continue to live in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Do you not know, that as many as have been immersed into Jesus Christ, have been immersed into his death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>We have been buried, then, together with him, by the immersion into death: that like as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father; so we also shall walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death; we shall then, also, certainly be in the likeness of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that we should not any longer serve sin:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>for he that has died is released from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>Moreover, if we have died with Christ, we believe that we shall also live with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>Knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, dies not again; death has no longer dominion over him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>for that he has died, he has died for sin once: but that he lives, he lives for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>So reckon yourselves also dead, indeed, to sin; but alive to God, by Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Let not sin, therefore, reign in your mortal body, by obeying it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>Neither present your members as instruments of unrighteousness, to sin; but present yourselves to God, as alive from the dead; and your members as instruments of righteousness, to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>Besides, sin shall not have dominion over you: for you are not under law, but under favor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then do we say? Shall we sin, because we are not under law, but under favor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Do you not know, that to whom you present yourselves servants, by obedience; his servants you are whom you thus obey; whether of sin into death, or of obedience into righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But, thanks to God, that though you were the servants of sin; yet you have heartily obeyed that model of doctrine to which you have been given up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>And being made free from sin, you have become the servants of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>(I speak after the manner of men, because of the infirmity of your flesh.) Wherefore, as you have presented your members servants to uncleanness, and to iniquity, to work iniquity; so present now your members, servants to righteousness, to work holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were servants of sin, you were free from righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>And what fruit had you, then, from these things of which you are now ashamed? for the reward of these things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now, being set free from sin, and having become servants of God, you have your fruit to holiness: and the end, everlasting life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Do you not know, brethren, (for I speak to them who know law,) that the law has dominion over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the married woman is bound, by law, to her husband as long as he lives; but if the husband be dead, she is released from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>If, then, indeed, while her husband lives, she be married to another, she shall be called an adulteress: but if her husband be dead, she is free from the law; so that she is not an adulteress, though married to another husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Thus, my brethren, you also have become dead to the law, by the body of Christ, that you may be married to another, who rose from the dead, that we may bring forth fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, our sinful passions which were through the law, wrought effectually in our members, to bring forth fruit to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now, having died with Christ, we are released from the law, by which we were held in bondage; so that we may serve God in newness of spirit, and not in oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>«What shall we say, then? Is the law sin? By no means. Indeed, I had not known sin, except by the law. For I had not known even inordinate desire, unless the law had said,» 'You shall not lust.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, taking occasion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of inordinate desire: for without the law sin is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>For I was alive, once, without the law: but when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>Yes, the commandment which was for live, the very same was found to be death to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking occasion by the commandment, deceived me, and by it slew me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>Wherefore, the law is holy, and the commandment holy, just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Has, then, that which is good become death to me? By no means. But sin becomes death, in order that it might manifest itself, causing death to me by that which is good: so that sin, (through the commandment,) might be an exceedingly great sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>Besides, we know that the law is spiritual: but I am carnal, sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For that which I do, I do not approve; since it is not what I desire that I do: but I do that which I hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>If, now, I do that which I do not desire, I consent to the law that it is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>But now it is no longer I myself who do this; but sin which dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, there dwells no good thing: for to desire what is good, is easy for me; but to do it, I find difficult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good which I desire, that I do not: but the evil which I desire not, that I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>Now, if I do that which I do not desire, it is no longer I who do it; but sin, which dwells in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find, then, that it is a law to me, when desirous to do good, that evil is near me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I take pleasure in the law of God, as to the inner man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I perceive another law, in my members, warring against the law of my mind, and making me a captive to the law of sin, which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>Wretched man that I am! who shall deliver me from this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God, through Jesus Christ our Lord! Wherefore, then, indeed, I myself serve, with my mind, the law of God; but with the flesh, the law of sin.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>There is, then, no condemnation, now, to those who are in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of Life by Christ Jesus, has freed me from the law of sin, and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what the law could not accomplish in that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own Son, in the likeness of sinful flesh, accomplished; and by an offering for sin, condemned sin in the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>That the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled by us, who walk not according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>Now, they who live according to the flesh, mind the things of the flesh; and they who live according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>But the mind of the flesh is death; and the mind of the Spirit is life and peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>because the mind of the flesh is enmity toward God: for, to the law of God it is not subject; neither, indeed, can be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>Those, then, who are in the flesh, can not please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>Now, you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit; because the Spirit of God dwells in you. But, if any one have not the Spirit of Christ, he is none of his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>And if Christ be in you, the body, indeed, is dead, with respect to sin; but the Spirit is life, with respect to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>For, if the Spirit of him, who raised up Jesus from the dead, dwell in you; he who raised up Christ from the dead, will make even your mortal bodies alive, through his Spirit, who dwells in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Well, then, brethren, we are not debtors to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>Wherefore, if you live according to the flesh, you shall die; but if, through the Spirit, you put to death the deeds of the body, you shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>Because, as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you have not received the spirit of bondage, again, to fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>Also this spirit bears witness, together with our spirit, that we are children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, then heirs; heirs, indeed, of God, and joint heirs with Christ; if, indeed, we suffer with him, that with him also we may be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>However, I esteem not the sufferings of the present time, as worthy of comparison with the glory, which is hereafter to be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creature, is waiting for the revelation of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creature was subjected to frailty, (not of its own choice, but by him who has subjected it,) in hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that it may be liberated, from the bondage of a perishing state, and brought into the glorious liberty of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>Besides, we know, that the whole creation sigh together, and travail in anguish till the present time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only they, but ourselves also, who have the first fruit of the Spirit; even we ourselves, groan within ourselves, waiting for the adoption; namely, the redemption of our body.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for that which we do not enjoy, then, with patience, we wait for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>In like manner, also, the Spirit helps our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray for, as we ought; however, the Spirit himself intercedes for us, in sighs, which can not be uttered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But he who searches the hearts, knows the mind of the Spirit; that, according to the will of God, he makes intercession for the saints.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he, who condemns them? It is Christ, who died; or rather, who has risen: who also, is at the right hand of God; and who makes intercession for us?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the congregation of God which is in Corinth, sanctified by Christ Jesus, called saints; with all, in every place, who invoke the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>favor and peace be with you from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I give thanks to my God always in respect of you; on account of the favor of God, which was given to you through Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that you were enriched with every gift, by him; even with all speech, and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>just as the testimony of Christ was confirmed among you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you come behind in no gift, waiting for the full manifestation of our Lord Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will confirm you till the end, without accusation in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom you have been called into the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now, brethren, I beseech you by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no schisms among you; but that you be perfectly united in the same mind, and in the same judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by some of the family of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>And I mention this, that each of you says, I, indeed, am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? or were you immersed into the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I give thanks to God that I immersed none of you except Crispus and Gaius;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest any one should say that I immersed into my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>And I immersed also the family of Stephanus: besides, I know not whether I immersed any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to immerse, but to proclaim the glad tidings; not, however, with wisdom of speech, that the cross of Christ might not be deprived of its efficacy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For this doctrine (the doctrine of the cross) is, indeed, foolishness to the destroyed; but to us, who are saved, it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>«Therefore, it is written,» 'I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will set aside the knowledge of the prudent.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise man? where the scribe? where the disputers of this world? Has not God shown the wisdom of this world to be folly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For, when, in the wisdom of God, the world, through wisdom, knew not God, it pleased God, through the foolishness of this proclamation, to save them who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>And though the Jews demand a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>yet we proclaim a crucified Christ: to the Jews, indeed, a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For you see the calling of you, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>but God has chosen the foolish of the world to put the wise to shame; and the weak God has chosen to put the strong to shame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>the ignoble of the world, and the despised, God has chosen; nay, those that are nothing, to reduce to nothing those that are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>that not flesh might boast in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>Of him, therefore, you are in Christ Jesus, who is become to us wisdom from God, justification, also, and sanctification, and redemption.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>Now, when I cam to you, brethren, I came not with excellency of speech, and of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined to make known nothing among you but Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I, in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling, was with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>My discourse, also, and my proclamation, were not with persuasive words of human wisdom; but with the demonstration of the Spirit, and of power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>That your faith might not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>However, we speak wisdom among the perfect: but not the wisdom of this world; neither of the rulers of this world, who are to be brought to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak the mysterious wisdom of God, which has been till now concealed; which God declared before the time of the ages, should be spoken to our glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>Which none of the rulers of this world knew: for if they had known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>«For, as it is written,» 'Those things eye has not seen, and ear has not heard, and into the heart of man have not entered, which God has prepared for them who love him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God has revealed them to us by his Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who, of men, knows the thoughts of a man, except the spirit of man which is in him: so, also, the thoughts of God no man knows, but the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now, we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which comes from God, that we might know the things which are gifted to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which things, also, we speak, not in words, taught by human wisdom; but in words taught by the Spirit, explaining spiritual things in spiritual words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>Now, an animal man receives not the thing of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually examined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But the spiritual man examines, indeed, all things, yet he is examined by no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For what animal man has known the mind of the Lord, who will instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>Now, I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to fleshly men, even as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>Milk I gave you-not meat; for you were not then able to receive it: nay, neither yet now are you able, because you are still fleshly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For, whereas, among you, envying, and strife, and divisions subsist; are you not fleshly, and walk after the manner of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>Besides, while one says, I, indeed, am of Paul; and another, I of Apollos, are you not fleshly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>For who is Paul, and who is Apollos; but ministers, by whom you have believed, even as the Lord has given to each?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I have planted, Apollos has watered; but God has made to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So that neither the planter is anything, nor the waterer; but God, who makes to grow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>However, the planter and the waterer are one, and each shall receive his proper reward, according to his proper labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>Wherefore, we are joint laborers, employed by God. You are God's field; you are God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the favor of God, which is given to me as a skillful architect, I have laid the foundation, and another builds upon it. But let every one take heed how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For other foundation no one can lay, except what is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if any one build on this foundation, gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>every one's work shall be made manifest: for the say will make it plain, because it is revealed by fire; and so the fire will try every one's work, of what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If the work of any one remain, which he has built upon the foundation: he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If the work of any one shall be burnt, he will suffer loss: himself, however, shall be saved, yet so as through a fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any one destroy the temple of God, him will God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If any one among you think to be wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>«For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God; for it is written,» 'He entangled the wise in their own craftiness.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>«And again,» 'The Lord knows the reasonings of the wise, that they are vain.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Wherefore, let no man boast in men; for all things are yours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come-all are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>So, then, let a man consider us as servants only of Christ, and stewards of the secrets of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Now, it is required in stewards, that every one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>Therefore, to me it is a very small matter that I be condemned by you, or by human judgment, seeing I do not condemn myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am conscious to myself of no fault. However, I am not by this justified; but he who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Wherefore, do not, before the time, pass any judgment, till the Lord come; who both will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and lay open the counsels of the hearts; and then praise shall be to every one from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now, these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself, and Apollos, for your sakes, that by us you may learn not to esteem teachers above what has been written, that no one of you may, on account of one teacher, be puffed up against another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>Besides, who makes you to differ? For what have you which you did not receive? And now, if you did receive it, why do you boast as not receiving it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Now you are filled! now you are become rich! you have reigned without it! and I wish, indeed, you had reigned, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has set forth us, the Apostles, last, as persons appointed to death; because we are made a spectacle to the world, even to angels, and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools on account of Christ; but you are wise in Christ: we are weak, but you are strong: you are honored, but we are despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>To the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>and labor, working with our own hands: when reviled, we bless: when persecuted, we bear:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>when defamed, we beseech: when we are become as the purgations of the world, the filth of all things until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I write not these things to shame you; but, as my beloved children, I instruct you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For, though you have ten thousand teachers in Christ, yet you have not many fathers; for, to Christ Jesus, through the gospel, I have begotten you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Wherefore, I beseech you, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this purpose I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord: he will put you in mind of my ways, which are in Christ, even as I teach everywhere, in every congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now, some are puffed up, as if I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you soon, if the Lord will, and shall know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the Reign of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you incline? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is generally reported that there is incest among you; and such incest as is not even among the heathens-that one has his father's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you are puffed up, and have not rather bewailed, so that he who has done this work might be taken from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>Wherefore, I, indeed, as absent in the body yet present in spirit, have already, as present, judged him who committed this act.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>My sentence is this: You being assembled, my spirit also being with you; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, with the power of the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not becoming. Do you not know, that a little leaven leavens the whole mass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Cleanse out, therefore, the old leaven, that you may be a new lump, seeing you are without leaven; for even our passover, Christ is sacrificed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore, let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness: but with unleavened sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote you, in that epistle, not to associate with the vicious;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>but I did not mean in general the fornicators of this world, the avaricious, the rapacious, or the idolaters; seeing, then, indeed, you must go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I write to you, if any one, called a brother, be a fornicator, or a covetous person, or an idolater, or a reviler, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; not to associate, not even to eat, with such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do to pronounce sentence on them also who are without? Do not you judge them who are within?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But them are without, God judges. Therefore, put away from among yourselves the wicked person.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Meats for the belly, and the belly for meats; however, God will destroy both it and them. Now, the body was not made for uncleanness, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>and God has both raised the Lord, and will raise up us by his own power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall, I, then, take the members of Christ and make them the members of a harlot? By no means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>«What! do you not know that he who is strongly attached to a harlot is one body? for he says,» 'The two shall be one flesh.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he, who is strongly attached to the Lord, is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee uncleanness. Every sin which a man commits, is without the body: but he who commits uncleanness, sins against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>What! do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who is in you, whom you have from God?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now, concerning the things of which you wrote me: It is good for a man not to marry a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Nevertheless, on account of uncleanness, let every man have a wife of his own, and let every woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband fulfill his obligations to his wife: and in like manner, also, the wife to the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife has not the command of her own person, but the husband: and in like manner, also, the husband has not the command of his own person, but the wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Deprive not one another, unless, perhaps, by consent, for a time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; and do you come again together, that Satan may not tempt you through your incontinency.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But this which follows I speak as an advice, and not as an injunction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>that I wish all men to be as I myself am. However, each has a proper gift from God; one, indeed, after this manner, and another after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>I say, to the unmarried men, and to the widows, it is good for them if they can remain even as I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>Yet, if they can not live continently, let them marry; for it is better to marry than to be in pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>Now, those who have married I charge, (yet not I, but the Lord;) let not a wife depart from her husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>but if she even depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her husband; and a husband must not put away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>But the rest I command, not the Lord; if any brother have an infidel wife, who herself is well pleased to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And a woman who has an infidel husband, who himself is well pleased to dwell with her, let her not put him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the infidel husband is sanctified by the wife, and the infidel wife is sanctified by the husband; otherwise, certainly, your children were unclean; whereas, indeed, they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the infidel depart, let him depart: the brother or the sister is not in bondage with such; but God has called us to peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For how do you know, O wife! whether you shall save your husband? And how do you know, O husband! whether you shall save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>But as God has distributed to every one, and as the Lord has called every one, so let him walk; and so, in all the congregations, I ordain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Has any circumcised one been called? Let him not be uncircumcised. Has any one been called in uncircumcision? Let him not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but the keeping of the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Let every one remain in the same calling in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you called, being a bondman? Be not careful to be made free. Yet, if you can be made free, prefer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For a bondman, who is called by the Lord, is the Lord's freedman. In like manner, also, a freedman who is called, is Christ's bondman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought with a price: become not the slaves of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>Brethren, in what state each one was called, in that let him remain with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Now, concerning virgins, I have not a commandment of the Lord: but, I give my judgment, as having obtained mercy of the Lord, to be faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>I declare this, then, to be good, on account of the present distress; namely, that it is good for a man who is unmarried, to continue so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Are you bound to a wife? seek not to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? seek not a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>And yet, if you marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marry, she has not sinned: nevertheless, affliction in the flesh such shall have; but I spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>Now, this I say, brethren, the time being short, it remains that both they who have wives, should be as not having wives;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and they who weep, as not weeping; and they who rejoice, as not rejoicing; and they who buy, as not possessing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and they who use this world, as not abusing it: for the form of this world passes by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>Besides, I would have you without anxious care. The unmarried man anxiously cares for the things of the Lord; how he shall please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But he who is married, anxiously cares for the things of the world; how he shall please his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>There is the like difference between the wife and the virgin. The unmarried woman anxiously cares for the things of the Lord; that she may be holy, both in body and spirit: but she who is married, anxiously cares for the things of the world; how she shall please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>Now, this I say, for your own benefit; not with a view to lay a snare for you, but for that which is becoming, and best adapted to a steady, uninterrupted adherence to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if any one thinks he acts improperly toward his virgin, if she be above age, unmarried, and so needs to be married; let him do what she inclines, he does not sin: let such marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But he who stands firm in his heart; not having necessity, and has power concerning his own will; and has determined this in his own heart, to keep his virgin, does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So, then, even he who gives her in marriage, does well; but he who gives her not in marriage, does better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife is bound, as long as her husband lives; but if her husband be dead, she is at liberty to be married to whom she pleases; only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is happier if she continue as she is. This is my opinion; and I think I have the Spirit of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.1'>Now, concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know, (for we all have knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.2'>However, if any one is confident of knowing anything, he has known nothing, yet, as he ought to know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.3'>But, if any one love God, the same is acknowledged by him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.4'>Concerning, then, the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that an idol is nothing in the world; and that there is no other God but one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.5'>For though, indeed, there are nominal gods, whether in heaven or on earth; (as, indeed, there are many gods, and many lords;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.6'>yet, to us, there is but one God, the Father; of whom all things are, and we for him: and one Lord Jesus Christ; by whom all things are, and we by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.7'>However, this knowledge is not in all: for some, till this hour, in the conscience of the idol, eat it, as a thing sacrificed to the idol; and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.8'>But meat does not recommend us to God: for neither, if we eat, are we the better; neither, if we do not eat, are we the worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>Nevertheless, take heed, lest, perhaps, this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to the weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if any one see you, who have knowledge, at table in an idol's temple, will not the conscience of him that is weak, be encouraged to eat things sacrificed to idols?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.11'>and through this, your knowledge, shall the weak brother perish, for whom Christ died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.12'>And, by thus sinning against the brethren, and wounding their conscience, you sin against Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.13'>Wherefore, if meat make my brother stumble, I will never eat flesh, lest I make my brother stumble.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.1'>Am I not an Apostle? Am I not a freeman? Have I not seen Jesus Christ, our Lord? Are you not my work in the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.2'>If to others I am not an Apostle, yet, to you, at least, I am; for the seal of my apostleship, are you, in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.3'>My answer to them who condemn me, is this:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.4'>Have we not liberty to eat, and to drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.5'>Have we not liberty to lead about a sister wife, as the other Apostles, and the brethren of the Lord, and Cephas?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.6'>Or, have I, only, and Barnabas, not liberty to forbear working?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.7'>Who, at any time, serves in the wars, on his own charges? Who plants a vineyard, and does not eat the fruit of it? Or who feeds a flock, and does not eat of the milk of the flock?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.8'>Do I speak these things as a man? Or does not the law also say these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.9'>«For, in the law of Moses it is written,» 'You shall not muzzle the ox treading out the corn.' 'Does God take care of the oxen?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.10'>Or, does he command this chiefly for our sakes? For our sakes, certainly, it is written: because, he who plows, ought to plough in hope; and he who threshes in hope, ought to partake of his own hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.11'>If we have sown for you spiritual things, is it a great matter, if we shall reap your carnal things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.12'>If others partake of this authority over you, ought not we, rather? Nevertheless, we have not used this power; but we bear all things, that we may not give any hindrance to the gospel of Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.15'>But I have used none of these privileges; neither have I written these things that it should be done to me: for it were good for me rather to die, than that any one should make my boasting void.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.16'>For when I declared the gospel, I have nothing to boast of; because necessity is laud upon me: yes, woe awaits me if I declare not the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.17'>Now, if I do this willingly, I have a reward; but, if against my will, still I am entrusted with the stewardship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.18'>What, then, is my reward? that, when declaring the gospel, I shall exhibit the gospel of Christ without charge, in order that I may not abuse my power in the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.19'>For, though I be a freeman, with respect to all; I have made myself a servant to all, that I might gain the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.20'>So, to the Jews, I became as a Jew, that I might gain the Jews: to those under the law, (though not under the law) as under the law, that I might gain those under the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.21'>to those without law, as without law, (not being without law to God, but under law to Christ,) that I might gain those that are without law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.22'>To the weak, I became as weak, that I might gain the weak. To all, I have become all things, that, by all means, I might same some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.23'>Now, this I do for the sake of the gospel, and that I may become a joint partaker of its rewards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.24'>Do you not know that they who run a race, all run, but one only receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold of the prize?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.25'>Now, every one who contends is temperate in all things: they, indeed, that they may receive a fading crown; but we, one that does not fade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.26'>I, therefore, so run, as not out of view. So I fight, not as beating the air:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.9.27'>but, I mortify my body, and keep it in subjection; lest, perhaps, having proclaimed to others, I myself should not be accepted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.3'>and all did eat the same spiritual meat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.4'>and all did drink the same spiritual drink; (for they drank of the spiritual rock, which followed them, and that rock was Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.10.5'>Nevertheless, with the greater part of them, God was not well pleased; for they were cast down in the wilderness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.1'>Now, concerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>You know that you were Gentiles, led away to dumb idols, even as you happened to be led.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>Wherefore, I inform you, that no one, speaking by the Spirit of God, pronounces Jesus accursed; and, that no one can declare Jesus Lord, except by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>Now, there are diversities of gifts, but the same spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>And there are diversities of ministries, but the same Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>And there are diversities of operations, but the same God, who works all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>And to each is given this manifestation of the Spirit, for the advantage of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>For to one, indeed, is given, by the Spirit, the word of wisdom: and to another, the word of knowledge, according to the same Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>And to another, faith, by the same Spirit: and to another, healing, by the same Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>and to another, the operations of powers: and to another, prophecy: and to another, diverse kinds of foreign tongues: and to another, the interpretation of foreign tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>Now, all these does the one and the same Spirit effectively work; distributing to each, respectively, as he pleases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>For, as the body is one, although it have many members; and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>Since, then, the body is not one member, but many;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>if the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it, for this, not of the body?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now, indeed, there are many members, but one body.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>Nay, those members of the body which seem to be more feeble, are necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And those which we think are less honorable members of the body, around them we throw more abundant honor; and so our uncomely members have more abundant comeliness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>But, our comely members have no need. However, God has tempered the body together; having given to the member which wants it, more abundant honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>That there may be no schism in the body; but, that the members may have the very same anxious care, one for another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now, you are Christ's body, and members in particular.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And these, indeed, God has placed in the congregation: first, Apostles; secondly, prophets; thirdly, teachers; next, powers; then, gifts of healing; helpers, directors, kinds of foreign languages.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.6'>and, perhaps, I shall abide, and even winter with you, that you may send me forward, whithersoever I may go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.7'>For I will not now see you in passing; but I hope to remain with you sometime, if the Lord permit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.10'>Now, if Timothy be come, take care that he be among you without fear; for he works, even as I do, the work of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.11'>Wherefore, let no one despise him; but send him forward in peace, that he may come to me; for I expect him with the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.12'>And with relation to our brother Apollos, I entreated him much to go to you with the brethren; but his inclination was not at all to go now, but he will go when he shall find a convenient season.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.17'>I am glad of the coming of Stephanus, and Fortunatus, and Achaicus; for they have supplied your deficiency,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an Apostle of Jesus Christ, by the will of God, and Timothy, the brother, to the congregation of God which is in Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of tender mercies, and the God of all consolation!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who comforts us in all out affliction, that we may be able to comfort them who are in any affliction, by the consolation with which they are comforted of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>For as the sufferings for Christ abound in us, also, our consolation abounds through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>Now, whether we are afflicted, it is for your comfort, and salvation; or whether we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which is effected by enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>And out hope of you is steadfast, knowing that, as you are partakers of the sufferings, so shall you be also of the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>Wherefore, brethren, we would not have you ignorant concerning our affliction, which happened to us in Asia; that we were exceedingly pressed above our strength, insomuch as we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Nay, more, we ourselves had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we might not trust in ourselves, but in God, who raises the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us from so great a death, and does deliver; in whom we trust that he will yet deliver us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>you, also, laboring together in prayer for us, that the gift to us from many persons, may, by many, be acknowledged with thanksgiving for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For this is our glorying-the testimony of our conscience, that with godly simplicity and sincerity, (not with fleshly wisdom, but by the favor of God,) we have behaved ourselves in the world, and more abundantly among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we write no other things to you than what you read, and also acknowledge; and I hope that you will acknowledge, even to the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>seeing, indeed, you have acknowledged us in part, that we are your boasting, even as you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this persuasions I purposed to come to you first, that you might have a second gift;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and from you to pass through into Macedonia, and from Macedonia to come again to you, and by you to be sent forward into Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Having, then, purposed this, did I, indeed, use levity? or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh; so that with me there should be yes, yes, and no, no?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But as God is faithful, certainly our word, which was to you, was not yes and no.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was proclaimed to you by us, even by me and Sylvanus, and Timothy, was not yes and no; but in him was yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>And whatever promises are of God, were through him yes, and through him amen, to the glory of God, by us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now, he who establishes us with you in Christ, and who has anointed us, in God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who has also sealed us, and given us the earnest of the Spirit in our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>Moreover, I call on God as a witness against my soul, that to spare you, I have not as yet come to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we lord it over your faith, but we are joint promoters of your joy: for by the faith you stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>Besides, I determined this with myself, not to come again to you with sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I should make you sorry, who then is he that could make me glad, unless the same who is made sorry by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>Wherefore, I wrote to you this very thing, that, coming, I might not have sorrow from them in whom I ought to rejoice; being firmly persuaded concerning you all, that my joy is the joy of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much affliction and distress of heart, I wrote to you with many tears; not that you might be made sorry, but that you might know the love which I have most abundantly toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>Now, if a certain person has grieved me, he has not grieved me except by a part of you, that I may not lay a load on you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient for such a one is the punishment, which was inflicted by the majority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>So that, on the other hand, you ought more willingly to forgive and comfort him, lest such a one should be swallowed up by excessive grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Wherefore, I beseech you to confirm your love to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end, also, I wrote, that I might know the proof of you, whether you be obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>Now, to whom you forgive anything, I also forgive: and even I, if I have now forgiven anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes I forgave it, in the person of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>that we may not be overreached by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Moreover, when I came to Troas, in order to declare the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I found not Titus, my brother: therefore, bidding them farewell, I went away into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now, thanks be to God, who at all times causes us to triumph in Christ; and who, by us, diffuses the odor of the knowledge of him in every place:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>for we are, through God, a fragrant odor of Christ, among the saved and among the destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To these, indeed, we are the odor of death, ending in death; but to the others, the odor of life, ending in life: and who is competent to these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>However, we are not like many who adulterate the word of God: but really from sincerity, yes, really from God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Must we begin again to commend ourselves? or need we, as some, letters of recommendation to you, or letters of recommendation from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are out letter, written on our hearts, known and read of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>For you are plainly declared Christ's letter, ministered by us, written, not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not on tables of stone, but on fleshly tables of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>Now we have such confidence through Christ, toward God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>not that we are competent by ourselves to reckon anything as from ourselves: but our competency is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who has made us competent ministers of a new institution; not of letter, but of spirit: for the letter kills; but the spirit makes alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>For if the ministration of death in letters engraved on stone was with glory, so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses, because of the glory of his face, which was to be abolished;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how much rather shall not the ministration of the Spirit be with glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministration of condemnation was glorious, much more does the ministration of justification abound in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For, indeed, that which was glorified, was not glorified, in this respect, by reason of the transcendent glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which is abolished was with glory, much more that which continues, is with glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having, therefore, such confidence, we use great plainness of speech;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and not as Moses, who put a vail upon his face, that the children of Israel might not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>Indeed, their minds were blinded: for, till this day, the same vail remains in the reading of the Old Institution; it not being discovered that it is abolished in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>Moreover, till this day, when Moses is read, the vail lies upon their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But when it shall turn to the Lord, the vail shall be taken from around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now, the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>And we all, with unveiled face, beholding, as in a mirror, the glory of the Lord; are transformed into the same image, from glory to glory, as by the Lord, the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Wherefore, having this ministry, as we have received mercy, we do not falter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>but have commanded away the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness, nor handling the word of God deceitfully; but by the manifestation of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>If then, indeed, our gospel be veiled, it is veiled among the destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>among whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelieving, lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, might shine into them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>Now, we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord; and ourselves your servants, for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For God, who commanded light to shine out of darkness, has shined into our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellency of the power might be of God, and not of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>We are pressed on every side, but not straitened; perplexed, but not in despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, but not utterly forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>At all times carrying about in the body, the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who live are always exposed to death for the sake of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus may be manifested in our mortal flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So that death works in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>«Yet, having the same spirit of faith, according to what is written,'I believed, therefore I have spoken'; we, also, believe, and therefore speak;»</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that he who raised up the Lord Jesus, will raise us up, also, by Jesus, and will present us with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all these things are for your sakes; that the favor which has abounded to many, may, through the thanksgiving of the greater number, redound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Wherefore, we do not faint; but, though, indeed, out outward man is impaired, yet the inward man is renewed, day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our momentary light afflictions work out for us an eternal weight of glory, great beyond expression;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>while we are aiming, not at things seen, but at things unseen: for the things seen are temporal, but the things unseen are eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if the earthy house of this our tabernacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a house not made with hands, everlasting, in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For, indeed, in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be invested with our heavenly mansion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>And surely, being thus invested, we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For, indeed, we that are in this tabernacle do groan, being burdened: not that we desire to be divested, but invested: that mortality may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now he who has wrought us up to this very desire, is God, who has also given us the earnest of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>We are, therefore, always courageous; knowing that while at home in the body, we are absent from the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(for we walk by faith, not by sight.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>We are courageous, indeed, and desirous rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore, also, we strive earnestly, whether at home, or from home, to be acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the tribunal of Christ, that every one may receive the things done in the body, according to what has been done, whether good or evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord, we persuade men; and are made manifest to God: and, I trust, are made manifest also to your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>However, we do not again commend ourselves to you, but only give you occasion of boasting concerning us, that you may have an answer to them who boast in appearance, not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For, whether we be beside ourselves, it is for God; or whether we be sober, it is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ constrains us, having judged thus- that if one has died, certainly all have died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and that he has died for all, that they who live should no longer live to themselves, but to him who has died and rose again for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>So that we, from this time forth, respect no man on account of the flesh: and even if we have esteemed Christ on account of the flesh, yet now we esteem him no more on that account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>For, if any one be in Christ, he is a new creature; old things have passed away; behold, all things have become new!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all these things of God, who has reconciled us to himself through Jesus Christ, and has given us to the ministry of the reconciliation-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>namely, that God was, by Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not counting to them their trespasses, and has committed to us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>We, therefore, execute the office of ambassadors for Christ, as of God beseeching you by us; we pray you, in behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For he has made him, who knew no sin, a sin-offering for us; that we might become the justified of God, by him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>We, then, as fellow-laborers, also beseech you not to receive the favor of God in vain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>«(for he says,» 'In an accepted season I have hearkened to you; and in a day of salvation I have helped you.' 'Behold, now is a highly accepted season; behold, now is a day of salvation:)'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>giving no cause of offense in anything, that the ministry be not blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>But by everything approving ourselves as ministers of God, by much patience, by oppressions, by necessities, by distresses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>by stripes, by imprisonments, by tumults, by labors, by watchings, by fastings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>by purity, by knowledge, by long-suffering, by goodness, by a holy spirit, by love unfeigned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>by the word of truth, by the power of God, through the armor of righteousness of the right hand and of the left;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>through honor and dishonor, through bad fame and good fame; as deceivers, yet true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as unknown, yet well known; as dying, yet, behold, we live; as chastened, yet not killed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as sorrowing, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing all things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless, God, who comforts them who are cast down, comforted us by the coming of Titus-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>(not, indeed, by his coming only; but more especially by the consolation with which he was comforted by you) -when he told us your earnest desire, your lamentation, your zeal for me; so that I rejoiced the more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>Therefore, though I made you sorry by the letter, I do not repent, though I did repent; for I perceive that that letter, though suitable to the occasion, made you sorry.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>And, indeed, though I wrote to you, it was not for his sake who did the wrong, nor for his sake who suffered it; but rather, that our care for you, in the presence of God might be manifested to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>For this reason, we were comforted in your comfort: yes, we rejoiced the more exceedingly for the joy of Titus, because his spirit was refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>That if I have boasted anything to him concerning you, I am not ashamed: for, as we have spoken all things to you in truth, so, also, our boasting to Titus is verified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his tender affection is more abundant toward you, while he remembers the obedience of you all, and how you received him with fear and trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice that I have confidence in you in everything.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Moreover, brethren, we make known to you the charity of God, which is given by the congregations of Macedonia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that in a great trial of affliction, the abundance of their joy, and their extreme poverty, superabounded to the riches of their liberality:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>that to their power, (I bear witness,) yes, beyond their power, they were willing of themselves; with much entreaty</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>requesting us to accept the charity and the participation of the service, which is for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>Yes, beyond our expectations; for they first gave themselves to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>This moved us to entreat Titus, that as he had formerly begun, so he would also finish the same charity among you likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>Now as you abound in every gift, (in faith, and speech, and knowledge, and all diligence, and in your love to us,) I wish that you may abound in this gift also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not this as an injunction, but on account of the diligence of others, and to prove the sincerity of your love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>(For you know the charity of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor; that you, through his poverty, might be rich.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And in this I give my opinion, not only to do, but also to be willing since the last year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>At present, therefore, finish the doing of it; that as there was a readiness to will; so also let there be to finish, according to your ability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there be a willing mind, according to what a person has, he is accepted; and not according to what he has not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>However, I mean not that others should be eased and you distressed; but on account of equality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>that now your abundance may be a supply for their want; that again, their abundance may be a supply for your want; that there may be an equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>«As it is written,» 'He who gathered much, had nothing over; and he who gathered little, had no lack.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>Now thanks be to God, who has put the same earnest care concerning you, into the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For he, indeed, received an exhortation; but from his great earnestness, was going to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And with him we have sent the brother, whose praise in the gospel is throughout all the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>And not only so, but who was also chosen by the congregations our fellow-traveler, with this charity, which is ministered by us, to the glory of the Lord himself, and of your readiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>using this precaution, that none may blame us in the distribution of this abundance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>premeditating things comely, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we have sent with them our brother, whom we have oftentimes found diligent in many things; but now much more diligent, from the great confidence which he has in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If any inquire concerning Titus, he is my partner and fellow-laborer for you; or if our brethren be inquired of, they are Apostles of congregations, and a glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Wherefore, the proof of your love, and of our boasting concerning you, display before them, and before the face of the congregations.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>But, indeed, concerning the ministry which is for the saints, it is superfluous for me to write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know your willingness: of which I boasted on your behalf, to the Macedonians, that Achaia was prepared since the last year; and your zeal has stirred up the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>Yet I have sent the brethren, that our boasting concerning you, may not be rendered false in this particular; but that as I said you may be prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>Lest, perhaps, if the Macedonians come with me, and find you unprepared, we (that we say not you) should be put to shame by this confidence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore, I thought it necessary to entreat the brethren, that they would go before you, and complete beforehand your formerly announced bounty; that the same might be thus ready as a gift, and not as a thing extorted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>Now this I say, he who sows sparingly, shall reap sparingly; and he who sows bountifully, shall reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Every one according as he has purposed in his heart, ought to give; not with regret, nor by constraint; for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make every blessing abound to you; that in everything, always having all sufficiency, you may abound in every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>«As it is written,» 'He has dispersed, he has given to the poor: his righteousness remains forever.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now, may he who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply your seed sown, and increase the products of your righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>That you may be enriched in everything, for all liberality, which produces, through us, thanksgiving to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For the ministry of this public service, not only fill us up completely the wants of the saints; but also abounds in many thanksgivings to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>They, through the proof of the ministry, glorifying God for you avowed subjection to the gospel of Christ; and for the liberality of your contribution for them, and for all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and for their prayer for you, who ardently love you, on account of the exceeding favor of God bestowed on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Now, thanks to God for his unspeakable gift.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now, I (the same Paul who, when present, indeed, am humble among you; but when absent, am bold toward you,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>beseech you, by the mildness and clemency of Christ. And I request that, when present I may not be bold with that confidence with which I conclude to be bold against some, who conclude us to be really persons who walk according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>(for the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly, but exceeding powerful for the overturning of strongholds;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>overturning reasonings, and every high thing raised up against the knowledge of God; and leading captive every thought to the obedience of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and are prepared to punish all disobedience, when your obedience is completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do you look on things according to appearance? If any one is confident in himself that he is Christ's, let him, on the other hand, reason this from himself, that he is Christ's, so, also, are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>And, therefore, I should not be ashamed, if I should boast somewhat more of our power, which the Lord has given us for your edification, and not for your destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>That I may not seem as if I would terrify you by letters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>(for his letters, says one, are indeed weighty and strong; but his bodily presence weak, and his speech contemptible;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>let such a one conclude this, that such as we are in speech by letters, when absent, the same, also, when present, we will be in deed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>But we dare not rank and compare ourselves with some who commend themselves: however, they, among themselves, measuring themselves, and comparing themselves with themselves, do not understand themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>Further, we will not boast of things not measured according to the line of measure, which the God of measure has allotted to us, to reach even to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we do not stretch ourselves beyond our line, as not reaching to you; (but we are come as far as to you also, in the gospel of Christ.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>We do not boast of things not measured, that is, of other men's labors; but we have hope when your faith is increased, to be by you abundantly enlarged with respect to our line;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>to declare the gospel in the regions beyond you; and not in another man's line, to boast of things already prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>He, then, who boasts, let him boast in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not he who commends himself is approved; but whom the Lord commends.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>I wish you would bear with me a little in my foolishness: yes, indeed, bear with me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>for I am jealous of you with a godly jealousy; because I have espoused you to one husband, that I might present you a chaste virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I am afraid that, by some means, as the serpent beguiled Eve by his subtlety, so your minds should be corrupted from the simplicity due to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For, if, indeed, he who has come preaches another Jesus whom we have not preached; or, if you receive another Spirit which you have not received; or another gospel which you have not embraced; you might justly bear with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I reckon myself to have come nothing short of the very chief of the Apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>And even though I be rude in speech, yet not in knowledge. But upon the whole, we have been made manifest to you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Have I committed an offense in humbling myself that you might be exalted; because I have preached to you the gospel of God freely?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other congregations, taking wages of them to do you service;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>for being present with you, and in want, we were burdensome to no one; but what I wanted, the brethren from Macedonia supplied: and in everything I have kept, and will keep myself from being burdensome to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>Is the truth in me? then this my boasting shall not be prevented in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>For what reason? because I do not love you? God knows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I do, that I will do, that I may cut off opportunity from them who desire opportunity; that in what they boast, they may be found even as we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such are false Apostles, deceitful workmen, transforming themselves into Apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder; for Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore, it is no great wonder if his ministers also transform themselves as ministers of righteousness: whose end shall be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>Moreover, I say, let no one think me a fool; but, if otherwise, at least, as a fool, bear with me, that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak in this confident boasting, I do not speak according to the Lord; but as in foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Seeing many boast according to the flesh, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For, being wise, you bear with fools cheerfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For if one enslave you, you bear it; if one devour you, if one take your goods, if one exalt himself, if one strike you on the face-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>I speak of reproach, as, that we are weak. But, in whatever any one is bold, (I speak foolishly,) I am bold also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? so am I. Are they Israelites? so am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? so am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool,) I am above them: in labors more abundant, in stripes above measure, in prisons more frequently, in deaths often;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>of the Jews, five times I received forty stripes, save one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>thrice I was beaten with rods, once I was stone, thrice I was ship-wrecked: I have spent a night and a day in the deep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>In journeys often, in dangers from rivers, in dangers from robbers, in dangers from my countrymen, in dangers from the heathens, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers at sea, in dangers among false brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>In labor and toil; in watching often; in hunger and thirst; in fastings often; in cold and nakedness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>Indeed, I knew such a man, (whether in the body, or out of the body, I do not know:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was suddenly conveyed away into paradise, and heard unspeakable things, which are not lawful for man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>Concerning such a one I will boast; but concerning myself I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>Yet if I should incline to boast, I shall not be a fool; for I will speak the truth: but I forbear, lest any one should think concerning me, above what he sees me to be, or what he hears from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>Indeed, that I might not be exalted above measure by the transcendency of the revelations, there was given to me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to buffet me, lest I should be exalted above measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Concerning this, I besought the Lord thrice, that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>But he said to me, My favor is sufficient for you, besides, my power is perfected in weakness: most gladly, therefore, I will boast rather of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may dwell upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Wherefore, I am well pleased with weaknesses, with insults, with necessities, with persecutions, with distresses, for Christ's sake; because when I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>Have I become a fool-? You have constrained me to it; for I ought to have been commended by you, because I am in nothing behind the very greatest Apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>After that, I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>and I was personally unknown to the congregations of Judea which are in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>They had only heard that-he who formerly persecuted us, now announces, as glad tidings, the faith which he formerly destroyed.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then, fourteen years after, I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas; taking Titus with me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went up by revelation; and communicated to them the gospel which I proclaimed to the Gentiles; but privately to them who were of reputation; lest, perhaps, I should run, or had run in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>However, neither Titus, who was with me, though a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>even on account of the false brethren secretly introduced; (who came in privily to spy out our liberty, which we have by Jesus Christ, that they might bring us into bondage;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>nor did we give place to them by submission, not even for an hour, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>Besides, from them who were of reputation, I received nothing; (whatever they were formerly, is no matter to me: God respects not a man's appearance. For they who were of reputation, communicated nothing to me.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>But, on the contrary, perceiving that I was entrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, just as Peter was with that of the circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for he who wrought effectually in Peter for the apostleship of the circumcision, also wrought effectually in me for the Gentiles):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>even James, and Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, having perceived the favor granted to me, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship; that we, indeed, should go to the Gentiles, and they to the circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>requesting only, that we would remember the poor, which very thing I had also been diligent to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>Moreover, when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was to be blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For, before certain persons came from James, he did eat with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew, and separated himself, being afraid of them of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the other Jews also dissembled with them, insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they did not walk uprightly, according to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter, before them all-If you, being a Jew, live after the manner of the Gentiles, and not after the manner of the Jews, why do you compel the Gentiles to Judaize?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We, who are Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>knowing that man is not justified by works of law, but only through the faith of Jesus Christ; even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we may be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by works of law; for by works of law no flesh shall be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if seeking to be justified by Christ, even we ourselves are found sinners, is Christ, then, the minister of sin? By no means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build again those things which I destroyed, I constitute myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>Besides, I, through law, have died to law, that I might live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I am crucified together with Christ. Nevertheless, I live; yet not longer I, but Christ lives in me: for the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith which is of the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not set aside the favor of God. For if righteousness is through law, then certainly Christ has died in vain.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O inconsiderate Galatians! who has deceived you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ crucified, was evidently represented among you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This, only, I wish to learn from you, did you receive the Spirit by works of law, or by obedience of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so inconsiderate that, having begun in Spirit, you are now made perfect in flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have you suffered so many things in vain? if, indeed, it is in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He, then, who ministered to you the Spirit, and wrought miracles among you, did he these by works of law, or by a hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>even as Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>know, therefore, that they who are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>«For the scripture, foreshowing that God would justify the nations by faith, formerly announced the gospel to Abraham, saying,» 'Surely in you shall all the nations be blessed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>Wherefore, they who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>«But as many as are of works of law, are under the curse: for it is written,» 'Accursed is every one who continues not in all things which are written in the book of the law, to do them.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>Now, the law is not of faith; but he who does these things, shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>«Christ has bought us off from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us: (for it is written,'Accursed is every one who is hanged on a tree':)»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>that the blessing of Abraham might come on the nations through Christ Jesus; and that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: no one sets aside, or alters a man's Will, after it is ratified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>«Now, to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He does not say,» 'And in seeds,' 'as concerning many; but as concerning one person, '«And in your see,» 'who is Christ.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>Wherefore, this I affirm, that the Will which was before ratified by God concerning Christ, the law, which was made four hundred and thirty years after can not annul, so as to abolish the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>Besides, if the inheritance be by law, it is no longer by promise. But God bestowed it freely on Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why, then, the law? It was added on account of transgression, till the seed should come to whom it was promised; being ordained by messengers, in the hand of a Mediator;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>and the Mediator is not one party; but God is one party.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law, then, contrary to the promise of God? By no means. For if there had been a law given, which was able to make alive, certainly righteousness would have been by law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture has shut up together all under sin, that the promise by faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>Wherefore, before faith came, we were kept in durance under law, shut up together to the faith, which should afterward be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>So that the law has become our instructor to Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But faith being come, we are no longer under this instructor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all the sons of God through the faith by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>Besides, as many of you have been immersed into Christ, have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither bondman nor freeman, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now, I say, as long as the heir is a minor, he differs nothing from a bondman, though he be lord of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>For he is under tutors and stewards, until the time before appointed by his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So, also, we, whilst we were minors, were in bondage under the elements of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>that he might redeem those under law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son into your hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>So that you are no more a bondman, but a son, and if a son, then heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But formerly indeed, when you knew not God, you served those, who by nature were not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now, having acknowledged God, (or rather, being acknowledged by God,) why do you turn back again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which again, a second time, you incline to be in bondage?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You carefully observe days and moons, and seasons and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid of you, lest perhaps, I have labored in vain among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Brethren, I pray you, be as I am: for I am you are. You have injured me in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>You know, indeed, that in weakness of the flesh, I declared the gospel to you at first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>Yet that trial of mine, which was in my flesh, you did not despise; neither did you reject me, but received me as an angel of God, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>What, then, was your happiness! for I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have plucked out your eyes, and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Am I, then, become your enemy, because I tell you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They love you ardently, not honorably. Yes, they wish to exclude us, that you may love them ardently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is honorable to be ardently in love with a good man at all times, and not merely when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, for whom I travail in birth again till Christ be formed in you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I could wish, indeed, to be present with you now, and to change my speech; for I am exceedingly in doubt concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons: one by the bondmaid, and one by the free woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he, indeed, who was of the bondmaid, was begotten according to the flesh; but he who was of the free woman, was through the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things are allegorized: for these women are two institutions; the one, indeed, from Mount Sinai, bringing forth children into bondage, which is Hagar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>(for the name of Hagar denotes Mount Sinai, in Arabia,) and she answers to the present Jerusalem, and is in bondage with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But the Jerusalem above, is the free woman, who is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>«For it is written,» 'Rejoice, O barren woman, who didst not bring forth! Break out and cry, thou who travailest not in birth; for more are the children of the deserted, than of her who had the husband.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>We, therefore, brethren, like Isaac, are children by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But even as then, he who was begotten according to the flesh, persecuted him who was begotten according to the Spirit: so also now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>«But what says the scripture?» 'Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free woman.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>You are loosed from Christ, who are justified by the law; you have fallen from favor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I wish, indeed, they were cut off who subvert you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For you, brethren, have been called into liberty; only use not this liberty for an occasion to the flesh; but through love, assiduously serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>«For the whole law is fulfilled by one precept, even by this,» 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things you would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now, the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these. Fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>sorcery, enmities, strifes, emulations, wraths, brawlings, factions, sects,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envying, murders, intoxications, revellings, and such like: concerning which I foretell you now, as I also have foretold, that they who practice these things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, fidelity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>meekness, temperance: against such things there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>Besides, they who are Christ's, have crucified the flesh with the passions and lusts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>were in the world at that time, without Christ, being aliens from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers to the institutions of promise; having no hope, and without God:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he is our peace, who has made both one, and has broken down the middle wall of separation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>having abolished, by his flesh, the enmity, (the law of the commandments concerning ordinances,) that he might make the two into one new man, under himself, making peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and might reconcile both to God, in one body, through the cross; having slain the enmity by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And, having come, he brought good news of peace to you, the far off-to us, the nigh:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>that, through him, we both have introduction to the Father, by one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>Now, then, you are no longer strangers and sojourners; but fellow-citizens with the saints, and of the household of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>having been built upon the foundation of the Apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the foundation corner stone;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>by which the whole building, being fitly compacted together, rises into a holy temple of the Lord;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.14'>Do all things without murmurings and disputings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.15'>that you may be blameless and harmless, the children of God, unblemished in the midst of a crooked and perverse race; among whom shine as lights in the world,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, that I also may be of good courage, that I also may be of good courage, when I know your affairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.20'>For I have no one like disposed, who will sincerely take care of your affairs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>for all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.22'>But you know the proof of him, that, as a son with a father, so he has served with me in the gospel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>However, I am fully persuaded by the Lord, that even I myself shall soon come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>Yet I thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellowlabourer, and fellowsoldier; but your Apostle, and a minister to my want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>For he longed after you all, and was exceedingly grieved, because you had heard that he had been sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>And, indeed, he was sick nigh to death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Wherefore I have sent him the more speedily, that seeing him again, you may rejoice, and that I may be the more free from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him, therefore, in the Lord, with all joy, and have such persons in great estimation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of Christ, he drew nigh to death, not regarding his life, that he might fully supply the want of your service toward me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.1'>Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me, indeed, is not irksome, and for you it is safe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the snarlers, beware of evil workers, beware of the excision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>for we are the circumcision, who worship God in spirit, who glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let us, then, as many as would be perfect, be thus minded; and if in anything you think differently, God will reveal even this to you.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Thess.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>Paul, and Sylvanus, and Timothy, to the congregation of the Thessalonians, which is in God the Father, and in the Lord Jesus Christ: Favor to you, and peace from God our Father, and from our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to God at all times for you all, making mention of you in our prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>incessantly remembering your work of faith, and labor of love, and patience of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ, in the sight of God, even our Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>knowing, brethren, beloved of God, your election:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>for our gospel came not to you in word only, but also with power, and with the Holy Spirit, and with much assurance: as you know what sort of men we were among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>And you became imitators of us, and of the Lord, having embraced the word in much affliction, with joy of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>So that you become patterns to all who believe, in Macedonia and Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>Besides, from you the word of the Lord has resounded, not only in Macedonia and Achaia; but also in every place your faith in God is spread abroad, so that we have no need to speak anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they themselves publish concerning us, what sort of entrance we had to you, and how you turned to God from idols, to serve the living and true God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he has raised from the dead, even Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is to come.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For yourselves know, brethren, our entrance among you, that it was not in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>For although we had before suffered, and were shamefully handled, as you know, at Philippi, we were bold, through our God, to speak to you the gospel of God, amidst a great combat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>Besides, our exhortation was not from error, nor from impurity, nor with guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>But as we were approved of God, to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God, who tries our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither did we, at any time, use flattering words, or a pretext for covetousness; God is witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Neither sought we honor from men; neither from you, nor from others. We might have acted with authority, as Apostles of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>but we were gentle among you, as a nurse cherishes her children-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>so, having a strong affection for you, we were well pleased to have imparted to you, not only the gospel of God, but our own souls, also; because you were become dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For your remember, brethren, our labor and toil; that laboring night and day; that we might not be chargeable to any of you, we preached to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You were witnesses, and God, also, in what a holy, and just, and blameless manner, we acted toward you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As, also, you know, how we addressed every one of you as a father his own children, exhorting and comforting you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>and testifying that you should walk worthy of God, who has called you to his kingdom of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>On this account, also, we give thanks to God, without ceasing, that when you received from us this message of God, you embraced not the word of men; but, as it is in truth, the word of God, which, indeed, works effectually in you who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brethren, became imitators of the congregations of God which are in Judea, in Christ Jesus; because you also have suffered like things from your own countrymen, even as they have from the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who both killed the Lord, and the prophets, and have greatly persecuted us, and do not please God, and are contrary to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>hindering us to speak to the Gentiles, that they may be saved; so that they fill up their iniquities always: but the wrath of God is coming upon them at length.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>Now, we, brethren, being separated from you for a short time, in presence, not in heart, the more abundantly endeavored, with great desire, to see your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore, we would have come to you (even I, Paul,) once and again, but the adversary hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of glorying? Are not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus Christ, at his coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>You, indeed, are our glory and our joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Wherefore, no longer concealing our anxiety, we were well pleased to be left at Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and sent Timothy, our brother, and a minister of God, and our fellow-laborer in the gospel of Christ, to establish you, and to exhort you concerning your faith:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one should be moved by these afflictions; for yourselves know that we are appointed to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For even when we were with you, we foretold you that we were to be afflicted; which also happened as you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>For this reason also, no longer concealing my anxiety, I sent to know your faith; lest by some means the tempter may have tempted you, and our labor have become in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now, when Timothy came to us from you, and gave us the good news of your faith and love, and that you have good remembrance of us at all times, ardently desiring to see us, even as we also to see you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>by this, brethren, we were comforted concerning you in all our affliction and necessity, even by your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>For now we live, when you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>But what thanksgiving can we return to God concerning you, for all the joy with which we rejoice, through you, in the presence of our God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>Night and day, most earnestly requesting to see your face, and to supply the deficiencies of your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may God himself, even our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ, make straight our way to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And may the Lord fill you, and make you overflow with love to one another, and to all, even as we also to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>that he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness, before God, even our Father, at the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, with all his saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>As to what remains, then, brethren, we beseech and exhort you by the Lord Jesus, that as you have received from us, how you ought to walk, and please God, you would more abound in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what commandments we gave you by the Lord Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>for this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from whoredom-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that every one of you should know how to possess his own body in sanctification and honor-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in the passion of lust, even as the Gentiles who know not God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>That no man should go beyond bounds, or defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger of all such;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>for God has not called us to impurity, but to holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore, indeed, he who despises not man, but God, who certainly has given to us his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But, concerning brotherly love, you have no need that I write to you, for you yourselves are taught of God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>And, indeed, you do it toward all the brethren who are in all Macedonia: but we exhort you, brethren, still to abound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and earnestly study to be quiet; and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your own hands, as we commanded you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>that you may walk decently toward them who are without, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>Now, I would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning them who sleep; that you may not be grieved, even as the others, who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again; so, also, them who sleep, will God, through Jesus, bring with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>Besides, this we affirm to you, by the word of the Lord, that we, the living, who remain at the coming of the Lord, shall not anticipate them who are asleep:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>for the Lord himself will descend from heaven, with a shout, with the voice of the Arch Angel, and with the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>afterward we, the living, who remain, shall, at the same time with them, be instantly taken up in clouds, to join the Lord in the air; and so we shall be for ever with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>Wherefore, comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>However, concerning the times and the seasons, brethren, you have no need that I write to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>for yourselves know perfectly, that the day of the Lord comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>When they shall say, Peace and safety, then sudden destruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child; and they shall not escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brethren, are not in darkness, that that day should come upon you like a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all sons of light, and sons of day: we are not sons of night, nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore, let us not sleep, even as others; but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For they who sleep, sleep in the night; and they who get drunk, get drunk in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But let us, who are of the day, be sober, putting on the breastplate of faith and love; and for a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God has appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation, through our Lord Jesus Christ, who died for us, that whether we wake or sleep, we may live together, with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>Wherefore, comfort one another, and edify each other, even as also you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Wherefore, comfort one another, and edify each other, even as also you do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>Now, we beseech you, brethren, to acknowledge them who labor among you, and who preside over you in the Lord, and instruct you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to esteem them very highly in love for their works' sake. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Moreover, we exhort you, brethren, admonish the disorderly, comfort the faint-hearted, support the weak, be of a long-suffering disposition toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>Take care that no one return evil for evil to any one, but always pursue what is good, both toward one another and toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God, by Christ Jesus, concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Quench not the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Despise not prophesying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>Prove all things. Hold fast that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from all appearance of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>And may the God of peace himself sanctify you wholly; and may your whole person, the spirit, and the soul, and the body, be preserved unblameable, till the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>Faithful is he who has called you; who also will do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brethren, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Salute all the brethren with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I solemnly charge you by the Lord, that this epistle be read to all the holy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.28'>The favor of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.1'>Now, we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.2'>that you be not suddenly shaken in mind, nor alarmed, neither by spirit, not by report, nor by letter, as from us, intimating that the day of the Lord is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.3'>Let no one lead you into a mistake by any means; because the apostasy must first appear, and the man of sin, the son of perdition, must be first revealed,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Thess.2.12'>that all may be condemned who have not believed the truth, but have taken pleasure in iniquity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.9'>Not because we have not a right, but that we might give ourselves to you for a pattern, to imitate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.10'>And, therefore, when we were with you, this we commanded you, that if any one will not work, neither let him eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.11'>For we hear that there are some who still walk among you disorderly, not working at all, but prying into other people's affairs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Thess.3.12'>Now, them who are such, we command and beseech by our Lord Jesus Christ, that with quietness they work, and eat their own bread.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>from which things some having swerved, have turned aside to foolish talking;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>desiring to be teachers of the law, neither understanding what they say, nor the things about which they are so positive.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>knowing this, that the law is not made for a righteous man, but for the lawless and disorderly, the ungodly and sinners, the unholy and profane; murderers of fathers, and murderers of mothers, manslayers,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>This saying is true, and worthy of all reception, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am chief.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.1'>I charge you, in the presence of God, and of Jesus Christ, who will judge the living and the dead, at his appearing in his kingdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.2'>proclaim the word, be instant in season, out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all long-suffering and teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.3'>For there will be a time when they will not endure wholesome doctrine; but, having itching ears, they will, according to their own lusts, heap up to themselves teachers:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.4'>and they will, indeed, turn away their ears from the truth, and be turned aside to fables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.5'>But do you watch at all times; bear evil treatment; do the work of an evangelist; fully perform your ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.6'>For I am shortly to be sacrificed, and the time of my departure is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.7'>I have combated the good combat, I have finished the race, I have continued faithful:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.8'>henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will deliver to me at that day; and not to me only, but also to all them who love his appearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.9'>Make haste to come to me soon:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.10'>for Demas, having loved the present world, has forsaken me, and has gone to Thessalonica; Crescens into Galatia, and Titus into Dalmatia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.11'>Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me in the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.12'>But Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.13'>The cloak which I left at Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the books, especially the parchments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.14'>Alexander, the coppersmith, has done me many evil things; the Lord will reward him according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.15'>of whom beware, for he has greatly opposed our words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.16'>At my first answer, no one appeared with me, but all forsook me. May it not be laid to their charge!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.17'>However, the Lord stood by me, and strengthened me, that through me, the proclamation might be fully declared, and all the Gentiles might hear; and I was delivered out of the mouth of the lion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.18'>And the Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and preserve me to his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.19'>Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the family of Onesiphorus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.20'>Erastus abode at Corinth; and Trophimus I left at Miletus, sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.21'>Make haste to come before winter. Eubulus salutes you; and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.4.22'>The Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Favor be with you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>Paul, a servant of God, and an Apostle of Jesus Christ, (according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledgment of the truth, which is according to godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life, which God, who can not lie, promised before the times of the ages-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>who has now manifested his word, at the proper season, by the proclamation with which I am entrusted, according to the appointment of God our Saviour;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>to Titus, my genuine son, according to the common faith: Favor, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ, our Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this purpose, I left you in Crete, that you might set in order the things left unfinished, and to ordain seniors in every city, as I commanded you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop should be blameless, as the steward of God; not self-willed, not prone to anger, not given to wine, not a striker, not one who makes gain by base methods;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but hospitable; a lover of good men, prudent, just, holy, temperate;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding fast the true doctrine, as he has been taught; that he may be able, by wholesome teaching, both to exhort and to confute the gain-sayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many unruly and foolish talked and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whose mouths must be stopped; who subvert whole families, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of sordid gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>«One of themselves, a prophet of their own, has said,» 'The Cretans are always liars, evil wild beasts, lazy bodies.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be healthy in the faith-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish fables, and precepts of men who pervert the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>To the pure, all meats are pure; but to the polluted and unbelieving, nothing is pure; for both their understanding and conscience are polluted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But do you inculcate the things which become wholesome doctrine:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>That aged women, in like manner, be in deportment as becomes sacred persons-not slanderers, not enslaved to much wine, good teachers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>that they may persuade the young women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>to be calm, chaste, careful of their families, good, subject to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be defamed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>In all things make yourself a pattern of good works: in teaching, show incorruptness, gravity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>wholesome speech which can not be condemned; that he who is on the opposite side may be ashamed, having nothing bad to say concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Exhort servants to be subject to their own masters, and in all things be careful to please, not answering again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>not secretly stealing, but showing all good fidelity, that they may adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the favor of God, which brings salvation, has appeared to all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>teaching us that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in this present world-</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Put them in mind to be subject to governments, and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to speak evil of no one; to be no fighters, but equitable, showing all meekness to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For even we ourselves were formerly foolish, disobedient, erring, slavishly serving diverse inordinate desires and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the goodness and philanthropy of God our Saviour shone forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>he saved us-not on account of works of righteousness which we had done-but according to his own mercy, through the bath of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>which he poured out on us richly, through Jesus Christ our Saviour;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>that being justified by his favor, we might be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This doctrine is true: and concerning these, I charge you to affirm strongly, that those who have believed in God, be studious to stand foremost in good works. These are things that are honorable and profitable to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But foolish questions, and genealogies, and strifes, and fightings about the law, resist; for they are unprofitable and vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>A factionist, after a first and second admonition, reject;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>knowing that such a person is perverted, and sins, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>When I shall send Artemas to you, or Tychicus, make haste to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have determined to winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Diligently help forward on their journey, Zenas, the lawyer, and Apollos, that nothing may be wanting to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>And let ours also learn to stand foremost in good works, for necessary uses, that they may not be unfruitful.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who, being in effulgence of his glory, and an exact representation of his character, and controlling all things by his own powerful word, after he had, by himself, made expiation for our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>being exalted as far above the angels, as the name he has inherited, is more excellent than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>«For, to which of the angels did he at any time say,'Thou art my Son: today I have begotten thee'? and again,'I will be his Father, and he shall be my Son'?»</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remains, therefore, a divine rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he who has entered into his rest, has himself, also, rested from his own works, like as God, also, rested from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Wherefore let us carefully strive to enter into THIS REST, lest any one should fall after the same example of unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And there is no creature concealed from his sight, for all things are naked and open to the eyes of him, to whom we must give an account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Now, having a great High Priest, who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not a High Priest who can not sympathize with our weaknesses; but one who was tried in all points, according to the likeness of his nature to our ours, without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us, therefore, approach, with boldness, to the throne of favor, that we may receive mercy, and obtain favor for the purpose of seasonable help.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men, is appointed to perform for men the things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>being able to have a right measure of compassion on the ignorant and erring: because he himself, also, is surrounded with infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And for that reason he must, as for the people, so, also, for himself, offer sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>Now, as no one takes this honor to himself, but he who is called of God, as Aaron was;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>«so, also, Christ did not assume to himself the honor of being a High Priest: but he who said to him,'Thou art my Son, today I have begotten thee'-»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>«also says, in another place,» 'Thou art a Priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>He, (who, in the days of his flesh, having, with loud cries, and with tears, offered up prayers and supplications to him who was able to save him from death, and was delivered from his fear,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>though being a Son, learned obedience by the things which he suffered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and being made perfect, became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>being proclaimed by God a High Priest forever, after the order of Melchisedec:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>(concerning whom we have much to say, and of difficult interpretation, since you have become dull of apprehension.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For, when, by this time, you ought to be teachers, you have need of some one to teach you again the first elements of the oracles of God; and have become such as need milk, rather than solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>Now every one who uses milk, is unskilled in the word of righteousness, for he is a babe:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>but solid food is for those of a mature age, whose faculties have been habituated by long practice to discriminate both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Wherefore, leaving the first principles of Christian doctrine, let us progress toward maturity, not laying again the foundation concerning reformation from dead works, and faith toward God-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>concerning the doctrine of immersions, and of imposition of hands, of a resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>for this we will do, if God permit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible to renew again to reformation those who have been once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the age which was to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and yet have fallen away, crucifying again to themselves the Son of God and exposing him to contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the land that drinks in the rain, which often comes upon it, and brings forth herbs, fit for them by whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but that which produces thorns and briers, is reprobated, and nigh to a curse; whose end is to be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But, beloved, we hope better things of you, even things which are connected with salvation, though we thus speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unrighteous, to forget your work, and the love which you have showed toward his name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>Yet, we earnestly desire every one of you to show the same diligence, in order to the realizing of this hope, to the end-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>that you may not be slothful, but imitators of them who, through faith and patience, are inheriting the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he swore by himself-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>«saying,'Surely, blessing, I will bless you, and multiplying, I will multiply you';»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>and so, having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men, indeed, swear by the greater; and an oath for confirmation is, to them, an end of all contradiction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Therefore, God, willing more abundantly to show to their heirs of promise the immutability of his purpose, confirmed it with an oath;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that, by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for God to lie, we might have strong consolation, who have fled away to lay hold on the hope set before us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and steadfast, and entering into the place within the vail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where a forerunner has entered on our account; even Jesus, made a High Priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchisedec-king of Salem, Priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom Abraham imparted even a tenth of all; being, indeed, by interpretation, first, king of righteousness, and next, also, king of Salem; which, by interpretation, is king of peace-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>was without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginnings of days, nor end of life: but, being made like the Son of God, he remains a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Now, consider how great this priest was, to whom even Abraham, the patriarch, gave a tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>For they, indeed, of the sons of Levi, who received the priesthood, have a commandment to tithe people according to the law; that is, their brethren, although they have come forth from the loins of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>but he, who did not derive his pedigree from their progenitors, tithed Abraham, and blessed the holder of the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Now, beyond all contradiction, the less is blessed by the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>Besides, here, indeed, men, who die, take tithes; but there one, of whom it is testified that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And, as one may say, even Levi, who receives tithes, was tithed in Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Moreover, if, indeed, perfection were through the Levitical priesthood, (for with it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should arise, according to the order of Melchisedec, and not be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>Wherefore, the priesthood being changed, there is, of necessity, a change also of law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he to whom these things are said, was of a different tribe, of which no one gave attendance at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is very plain that our Lord had sprung from Judah, in relation to which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>Moreover, it is still more plain that, according to the similitude of Melchisedec,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>another priest arises, who is made, not according to the law of a carnal commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>«For he testifies,» 'Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>Here then, there is a disannulling of the preceding commandment, because of its weakness and unprofitableness-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the law made no one perfect) -and the superinduction of a better hope, by which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>Moreover, inasmuch as not without an oath-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>«(for they, indeed, were make priests without an oath, but he, with an oath, by him who said to him,'The Lord has sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec,')»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much was Jesus made the surety of a better institution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>Besides, many, indeed, are made priests, because by death they are hindered from continuing:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>but he, because he lives for ever, has a priesthood which does not pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Hence, also, he is for able to save them who come to God through him; always living to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>Now such a High Priest became us; who, being holy, harmless, undefiled, separated from sinners, and made higher than the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>has not, like the high priests, need, from time to time, to offer sacrifices, first for his own sins, then for those of the people; for this latter he did once, when he offered himself up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law constitutes men high priests, who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was since the law, constituted the Son, who is perfected for evermore.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now of the things which we have spoken, this is the sum: We have such a High Priest, who has taken his seat at the right hand of the Majesty in the heavens-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a minister of the holy places; namely, of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is constituted to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Hence, it was necessary that this High Priest, also, should have something he might offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For, indeed, if he were on earth, he could not be a priest, there being priests who offer gifts according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>«(These perform divine service for an example and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses, when about to construct the tabernacle, was admonished of God:'See, now (says he,) that you make all things according to the type that was showed you in the Mount.')»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>Besides, he has now obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the mediator of a better institution, which has been established upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first institution had been faultless, a place would not have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>«But, finding fault, he says to them,» 'Behold, the days come, says the Lord, when I will make a new institution with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the institution which I made with their fathers, at the time of my taking them by the hand, to lead them out of the land of Egypt-because they did not abide in my institution, I also neglected them, says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>Now this is the institution which I will make with the house of Israel, after these days, says the Lord. I will put my laws into their mind, and inscribe them on their hearts, and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And they shall not teach every man his fellow-citizen, and every man his brother, saying, Know the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>«Because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and their iniquities I will remember no more.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>«By saying,» 'a new institution,' 'he has made the former old: now, that which is decaying and growing old, is ready to vanish away.'</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now, indeed, the first institution had both ordinances of service, and a worldly holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For the first tabernacle, which is called holy, was set in order; in which were both the candlestick and the table, and the showbread;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>and behind the second vail, the tabernacle which is called most holy-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having the golden censer, and the ark of the institution, covered everywhere with gold, in which were the golden pot having the manna, and the rod of Aaron, which budded, and the tables of the institution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and above it, the cherubim of glory, overshadowing the mercy-seat; concerning which things we can not at present speak particularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now, these things being this set in order, the priests go at all times indeed into the first tabernacle, performing the services;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the second tabernacle-the high priest alone-once every year, not without blood, which he offers for himself, and for the errors of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way of the holy places was not yet laid open, while the first tabernacle was yet standing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>which was a figurative representation for the time being, during which both gifts and sacrifices are offered which can not, with respect to the conscience, make him who does the service perfect-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>only with meats and drinks, and divers immersions- ordinances concerning the flesh, imposed till the time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ being come-a High Priest of the good things to come-has, through a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, (that is to say, not of this building,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>entered once into the holy places, having obtained eternal redemption; not indeed, by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and goats, and the ashes of a heifer sprinkling the polluted, sanctified to the cleansing of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more shall the blood of Christ, who, through an Eternal Spirit, offered himself without fault, to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And, for this reason, he is mediator of the new institution, that, by means of death, for the redemption of the transgressions under the first institution, those who had been called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>Now, where there is such an institution, the death of the instituted sacrifice must necessarily intervene:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>for since the institution is ratified over the dead, it has no force while the instituted sacrifice lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Hence, neither was the first introduced without blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>«for» 'when Moses had spoken every precept in the law to all the people, taking the blood of calves, and of goats, with water and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled both the book itself, and the people:'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>«saying,» 'This is the blood of the institution, which God has enjoined on you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>Moreover, he in like manner sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all the vessels of the ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And almost all thing, according to the law, were cleansed with blood; and without the shedding of blood, there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>It was necessary, then, indeed, that the representations of the things in the heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things themselves, with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>Therefore, Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands, the antitypes of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God, on our account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Not, however, that he should offer himself often, as the high priest enters into the holy places every year with other blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>for then he must have often sufferance since the foundation of the world: but now, once, at the conclusion of the ages, he has been manifested to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And, forasmuch as it is appointed to men once to die, and after that, the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>even so Christ, being once offered, to bear away the sins of many, will, to them who look for him, appear a second time, without a sin-offering, in order to salvation.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>Moreover, the law, containing only a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of these things, never can, with the same sacrifices which they offer every year continually, make those who come to them, perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For then would they not have ceased to be offered: since the offerers being once purified, should not have had any more conscience of sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>but, in these, there is a remembrance of sins yearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>Besides, it is impossible that the blood of bulls and of goats should take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>«Wherefore, when coming into the world, he says,» 'Sacrifice and offering thou hast not willed; but a body hast thou prepared me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In whole burnt offerings, and sin offerings, thou hast no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>«Then, said I, behold, I come to do thy will, O God! (In the volume of the book it is written concerning me.)»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Having said above, the sacrifice, and offering; and whole burnt offerings, and sin offerings thou hast not willed, neither has pleasure in them, (which are offered according to the law,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>«and then he said,» 'Behold, I come to do thy will.' 'He takes away the first will, that he may establish the second.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By which WILL we are sanctified, through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And, indeed, every priest stands, daily ministering, and offering often the same sacrifices, which never can take away sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>but he, having offered only one sacrifice for sins, through his whole life, sat down at the right hand of God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>thenceforth waiting till his enemies be made his footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>Wherefore, by one offering, he has perfected for ever the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>Moreover, also, the Holy Spirit testifies this to us; for, after he has said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>«This is the institution which I will make with them after these days, says the Lord: I will put my laws into their hearts, and inscribe them on their minds; he adds,»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>«and their sins and iniquities I will remember no more.»</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now, where remission of these is, there is no more offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Having, therefore, brethren, free access to the most holy place, by the blood of Jesus-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>a new and living way, which he has consecrated for us through the vail, (that is, his flesh,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and-a great High Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us draw near, with a true heart, in full assurance of faith-having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies washed with pure water,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom of some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more, as you see the day approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin willfully, after having received the knowledge of the truth, there remains no more sacrifice for sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a dreadful expectation of judgment, and of a fiery indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Symeon Peter, a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ, to them who have obtained like precious faith with us, through the righteousness of our God and Saviour Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>Favor and peace be multiplied to you, through the knowledge of God, and of Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>As his divine power has gifted to us all things which are necessary to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who has called us to glory and virtue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>On account of which, the greatest and most precious promises are freely given to us, that by these we might be made partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world, through lust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>And for this very reason, indeed, giving all diligence, add to your faith, courage; and to courage, knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>and to knowledge, temperance; and to temperance, patience; and to patience, godliness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and to godliness, brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness, love:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>for these things being in you, and abounding, make you to be neither slothful, nor unfruitful, in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>But he who has not these things, is blind, shutting his eyes, having become forgetful of the purification of his old sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Wherefore, the rather, brethren, earnestly endeavor to make your calling and election sure; for doing these things, you shall never fall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>and thus there shall be richly ministered to you, an entrance into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Wherefore, I will not neglect to put you always in remembrance of these things, although you know, and are established in the present truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>Yes, I think it fit, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir you up, by putting you in remembrance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>knowing, that the putting off of this, my tabernacle, is soon to happen, even as our Lord Jesus Christ has showed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>Therefore, I will carefully endeavor that you may be able, after my decease, to have these things always in remembrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but were eye-witnesses of his grandeur;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>«for when he received from God the Father honor and glory, a vice to this effect came to him from the magnificent glory,» 'This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I delight.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>Knowing this first, that no prophecy brought by the will of man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>but the holy men of God spoke, being moved by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you; who will privately introduce destructive sects, denying even the Lord who bought them, bringing on themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many will follow their lewd practices, on account of whom, they way of truth will be evil spoken of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And through covetousness, they will make merchandise of you, by fictitious tales: to whom the punishment threatened of old lingers not, and their destruction slumbers not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For God, indeed, did not spare the angels who sinned, but with chains of darkness confining them in Tartarus, delivered them over to be kept for judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and did not spare the old world, but saved Noah, the eighth, a proclaimer of righteousness, when he brought the flood upon the world of the ungodly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and having reduced to ashes the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, punished them with an overthrow, making them an example to those who should afterward live ungodly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>and rescued righteous Lot, exceedingly grieved by the lewd behavior of the lawless:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for; -that righteous man, dwelling among them, by the sight and report of their unlawful deeds, tormented his righteous soul from day to day;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>the Lord knows how to rescue the godly out of temptation, and to reserve the unrighteous to a day of judgment to be punished;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>but especially those who go after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness, and who despise government: being audacious, self-willed, who fear not to revile dignitaries;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas, angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring a reviling accusation against them before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, as natural, irrational animals, made for capture and destruction, speaking evil of matters which they do not understand, shall be utterly destroyed by their own corruptions;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>receiving the due reward of unrighteousness. These delight to spend the day in luxurious festivity: they are spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceits when they feast with you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of the adulteress, incessantly sinning, alluring unstable souls; having a heart exercised with insatiable desires; an accursed progeny:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>having forsaken the right path, they have wandered, following in the way of Balaam, the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of iniquity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>and was convicted of his transgression; the dumb brute, speaking with man's voice, reprimanded the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are wells without water, clouds driven by a tempest; for whom the blackness of darkness is reserved forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>for, speaking great swelling words of falsehood, they allure by the lusts of the flesh, even by lasciviousness, those who have actually fled away from them who are living in error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>They promise them liberty, whilst they themselves are slaves of corruption: for every one is enslaved by that which overcomes him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>Now, if, having fled away from the pollutions of the world, through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, and being again entangled, they are overcome by them; their last condition is worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>Therefore, it has been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than having known it, turn away from the holy commandment delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>«But the saying of the true proverb has happened to them:» 'The dog is returned to his own vomit; and the washed hog, to its wallowing in the mire.'</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>Beloved, this second epistle I now write to you, in which epistles I stir up your sincere mind to remembrance:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>to be mindful of the words before spoken by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us, the Apostles of the Lord and Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>Knowing this first, that scoffers will come in the last days, walking after their own lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for from the time the fathers fell asleep, all things continue as at the beginning of the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>But this willfully escapes them, that, by the word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth subsisting from the water, and by water:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by which the world that then was, being deluged with water, perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>But the present heavens and the earth, by the same word are treasured up, being kept for fire to a day of judgment, and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But this one thing, let it not escape you, beloved, that one day is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord does not delay his promise in the manner some account delaying; but he exercises long-suffering toward us, not desiring that any should perish, but that all should come to reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>However, as thief, the day of the Lord will come; in which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and the elements burning shall be dissolved; and the earth, and the works that are upon it, shall be utterly burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Seeing, then, all these things shall be dissolved; -what sort of persons ought you to be, in holy behavior and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>expecting and earnestly desiring, the coming of the day of God; in which the heavens being set on fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements burning, shall be melted?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But we, according to his promise, expect new heavens, and a new earth, in which dwells righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Wherefore, beloved, expecting these things, diligently endeavor to be found of him spotless, and irreproachable, in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And reckon the long-suffering of our Lord, to be for salvation; as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, has written to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>As, indeed, in all his epistles, speaking in them concerning these things: in which there are some things hard to be understood, which the untaught and unstable wrest, as they do also the other scriptures, to their own destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>Therefore, beloved, foreknowing these things, be on your guard; lest being also carried away by the deceit of the lawless, you fall from your own steadfastness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in favor, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. Yet if any one has sinned, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Just One.</verse>
