        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Jushia begat Jukania and his brethren at the exile of Bobel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the exile of Bobel Jukania begat Shalathiel, Shalathiel begat Zurbobel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zurbobel begat Abiud, Abiud begat Aliakim, Aliakim begat Ozur,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Ozur begat Zoduk, Zoduk begat Akin, Akin begat Aliud,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jakub begat Jauseph, husband of Mariam, of whom was born JESHU who is called the Meshicha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>Thus all the generations from Abraham to David (were) fourteen generations; and from David to the exile of Bobel, fourteen generations; and from the exile of Bobel to the Meshicha, fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>NOW the nativity of Jeshu the Meshicha was thus: While Mariam his mother was betrothed to Jauseph, before they could be consociated, she was found to be with child from the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>But Jauseph her husband was just, and, not willing to defame her, meditated privately to release her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while (on) these (things) he reflected, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, and said to him, Jauseph, son of David, fear not to take Mariam thy wife; for that which is conceived in her is from the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>She shall give birth to a son, and thou shalt call his name JESHU; for he shall save his people from their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this was done, that what was spoken from the Lord by the prophet might be fulfilled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth the son, and they shall call his name Amanuel; which is interpreted, With us (is) our Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Jauseph, when he had arisen from his sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and took unto him his wife;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and knew her not until she had given birth to her son, the firstborn; and she called his name Jeshu.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>NOW when Jeshu was born in Beth-lechem of Jehuda, in the days of Herodes the king, there came Magians from the East to Urishlem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>and they said, Where is the king of the Jews who is born? for we have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>But Herodes the king heard, and was troubled, and all Urishlem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And he assembled all the chief priests and scribes of the people, and anxiously inquired of them where the Meshicha should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>But they said, In Beth-lechem of Jehuda; for so it is written in the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>Also thou, Beth-lechem of Jehuda, wast not the least among the kings of Jehuda; for from thee shall come forth the king who shall be as a shepherd to my people Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herodes privately called the Magians, and learned from them at what time the star appeared to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and he sent them to Beth-lechem, and said to them, Go and inquire diligently concerning the child; and when you have found him, come, show me, and I also will go and will worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>But they, when they had heard the king, went forth; and, lo, the star, which they had seen in the east, proceeded before them, until it came and stood over against where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>Now when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And they entered the house, and beheld the child with Mariam his mother; and they fell down, and worshipped him. And they opened their treasures, and offered unto him oblations; gold, and myrrh, and frankincense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And it was shown to them in a dream, that they should not return unto Herodes; so, by another way, they went unto their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>AND when they were gone, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream unto Jauseph, and said to him, Arise, take the child and his mother, and flee into Metsreen, and there be until I tell thee; for it will be that Herodes will seek the child, that he may destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>Then Jauseph arose, took up the child and his mother, and fled by night into Metsreen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herodes. That it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying, Out of Metsreen have I called my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herodes, when he saw that he had been deluded by the Magians, was greatly wroth, and sent (and) killed all the children of Beth-lechem, and all its limits, from two years and under, according to the time which he had inquired from the Magians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Eramio the prophet, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A cry was heard in Rometha; weeping and great lamentation; Rochel weeping for her children, and not willing to be comforted, because they are not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>BUT when Herodes, the king, was dead, the angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Jauseph in Metsreen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>and said to him, Arise, take the child and his mother, and go into the land of Isroel; for they are dead who sought the life of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>And Jauseph arose, (and) took the child and his mother, and came into the land of Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Arkelaos was the king in Jehud, instead of Herodes his father, he was afraid to go thither: and it was shown to him in a dream, that he should go into the region of Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and dwelt in a city which is called Natsrath. So would be fulfilled that which was spoken by the prophet, that a Nazarene he should be called.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>NOW in those days came Juchanon the Baptizer preaching in the desert of Jehud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, Repent! the kingdom of heaven hath drawn nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he of whom it was spoken by Eshaia the prophet: The voice which crieth in the desert, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>But this Juchanon, his clothing was of the hair of camels, with a loins-belt of leather upon his loins; and his food was locusts and wilderness-honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went forth to him Urishlem, and all Jehud, and the whole country about Jurdan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were baptized of him in Jurdan, the river, while they were confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharishee and Zodukoyee coming to be baptized, he said to them, Generation of vipers, who hath showed you to escape from the wrath that cometh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Work, therefore, fruits which are suitable to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>Neither ruminate and say within yourselves, that Abraham is father to us; for I say to you that Aloha is able from these stones to raise up sons unto Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>But, behold, the axe lieth at the root of the trees; every tree, therefore, which maketh not good fruit is cut down and falleth into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I, indeed, baptize you with water unto repentance; but He who cometh after me is mightier than I; he, whose sandals I am not worthy to bear,-he baptizeth you with the Spirit of Holiness and with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>He (it is) whose fan is in his hand, and, purifying his floors, the wheat he gathereth into his garner, but the chaff he burneth with the fire that is not quenched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then came Jeshu from Galila unto Jurdan to Juchanan to be baptized of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But Juchanon prohibited him, and said, I need from thee to be baptized, and hast thou come unto me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jeshu answered and said unto him, Permit now; for thus it becometh us to accomplish all righteousness. And then he permitted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>But when Jeshu was baptized, he immediately ascended from the waters; and the heaven was opened unto him; and he saw the Spirit of Aloha, who descended, like the dove, and came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And, lo, the voice from heaven, which said, This (is) my Son, the Beloved, in whom I have delighted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>THEN Jeshu was led by the Spirit of Holiness into the desert, that he should be tempted by the Accuser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And he fasted forty days and forty nights; but afterward he hungered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And he who tempteth approached and said, If the Son thou art of Aloha, say that these stones shall become bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered and said, It is written that not by bread alone liveth the Son of man, but by every word which proceedeth from the mouth of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the Accuser taketh him to the holy city, and caused him to stand on the pinnacle of the temple;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, If the Son thou art of Aloha, throw thyself down; for it is written that his angels he shall command concerning thee, and upon their hands they shall bear thee, that thou strike not against a stone thy foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jeshu said to him, Again it is written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the Accuser took him to a mountain which is exceeding high, and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and said to him, These all to thee will I give, if thou wilt fall and worship me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then said Jeshu to him, Away with thee, Satana! for it is written that the Lord thy Aloha thou shalt worship, and him only thou shalt serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the Accuser left him, and, behold, the angels drew nigh and ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>BUT when Jeshu heard that Juchanan was perfected, he removed into Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And he left Natsrath, and came and dwelt in Kaphar-Nachum by the sea-side on the borders of Zabolon and of Naptholi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>That the thing might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet Eshaia, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>The land of Zabolon, the land of Naptholi, the way of the sea beyond Jurdan, Galila of the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who sat in darkness the great light hath seen; and they who have sat in the region and shadow of death, the light has arisen upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time began Jeshu to preach, and to say, Repent! for the kingdom of heaven hath drawn nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>And while he walked by the sea of Galila, he saw two brethren, Shemun who was called Kipha, and Andreas his brother, who were casting their nets into the sea, for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And Jeshu said to them, Come after me, and I will make you to become fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And they immediately forsook their nets and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And when he had passed thence, he saw two other brethren, Jakub-bar-Zabdai and Juchanan his brother, in a vessel with Zabdai their father, repairing their nets: and Jeshu called them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>and they forthwith left the vessel and their father, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jeshu perambulated all Galila, and taught in their synagogues, and preached the announcement of the kingdom, and healed all disease and affliction in the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And his fame was heard in all Suria; and they brought to him all those who were grievously affected with various diseases, and those who were pressed down by strong pains, and demoniacs, and lunatics, and the paralysed; and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And there went after him great gatherings from Galila, and from the ten cities, and from Urishlem, and from Jehud, and from beyond Jurdan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>BUT when Jeshu saw the multitudes, he ascended a mountain; and when he had sat down, his disciples drew near to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and he opened his mouth and taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>BLESSED (are) the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed the mourners, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed they who hunger and thirst unto righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed the merciful, for upon them shall be mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed they who are pure in their hearts, for they shall see Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed the makers of peace, for the children of Aloha shall they be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed they who are persecuted because of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are you when they treat you with reviling, and persecute you, and say concerning you every evil word, for my sake, in falsity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Then be glad and exult, for your reward is great in heaven; for so persecuted they the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth: but if it happen that salt become tasteless, with what shall it be seasoned? It goeth for nothing but to be thrown without and trodden down by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world: It is not possible that a city which is built upon a hill can be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do they kindle a lamp and place it beneath a measure, but on a candlestick, and it enlighteneth all who are in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>So let your light shine before the sons of men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Think not that I came to loose the law or the prophets: not that I might loose, but that I might fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For, Amen I say unto you, that until heaven and earth shall pass away, one yod, or one point, shall not pass from the law, till all be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Every one, therefore, who shall set loose one from these least commandments, and shall so teach the children of men, the least shall he be called in the kingdom of heaven: but every one who shall do and teach, this shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness shall abound more than that of the scribes and the Pharishee, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>YOU have heard that it was said unto them who were before, Thou shalt not kill; and whosoever shall kill is obnoxious to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say unto you, that he who is angry against his brother rashly, is obnoxious to the judgment; and he who shall say to his brother, Thou empty one! is liable to the council; and every one who shall say, Thou fool! is liable to the gihano of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If it occur, therefore, that thou bring thy oblation to the altar, and there rememberest that thy brother retaineth some enmity against thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there thy oblation at the altar, and go, first be reconciled with thy brother, and then come and offer thy oblation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Be at one with thine adversary quickly, while thou art with him in the way; lest thy adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver thee to the exactor, and thou fall into the house of the bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>And, Amen I say unto thee, that thou shalt not come forth from thence till thou hast rendered the last shamuna.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt not commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, that every one who beholdeth a woman so as that he shall desire her, already committeth adultery in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>But if thy right eye cause thee to offend, root it out and cast it from thee: it is better to thee that one of thy members should perish, than that thy whole body should fall into gihano.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if thy right hand cause thee to offend, cut it off and cast it from thee; for it is better to thee that one from thy members should perish, rather than thy whole body should fall into gihano.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>It hath been said, that he who looseth his wife should give her a writing of divorcement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say unto you, that whosoever looseth his wife, except on account of fornication, maketh her to commit adultery; and whosoever taketh her who is sent away, committeth adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again, you have heard it was said to those beforetime, Thou shalt not lie in thine oaths, but shalt fulfil thine oaths unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say unto you, Swear not at all: not by heaven, for it is the throne of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by earth, for it is the foot-stool beneath his feet; neither by Urishlem, for it is the city of the great king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, for thou canst not make a single hair in it either black or white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your discourse be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay; for whatsoever is more than these is from the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say unto you, that you shall not rise up against evil: but if any one strike thee on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And if any one will contend with thee to take away thy tunic, leave him thy mantle also;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>and if a man compel thee one mile, go with him twain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to him who asketh from thee, and him who would borrow from thee refuse not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>You have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and hate thine enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say unto you, Love your enemies; bless them who execrate you; do that which is good to him who hateth you; and pray for them who lead you with a chain, and persecute you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>That you may be the children of your Father who is in heaven, who causeth his sun to arise on the good and on the evil, and who sendeth showers on the just and on the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love those (only) who love you, what reward have you? do not even the tribute-gatherers this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you wish peace to your brethren only, what more do you than they? do not also the tribute-gatherers this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Be ye therefore perfect, as your Father who is in heaven is perfect!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>SEE that in your almsgiving you do it not before men, so as that you may be observed by them; otherwise no reward is for you with your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>When, therefore, thou art doing alms, sound not a trumpet before thee, as do the assumers of faces in the assemblies and streets, so that they may be praised from men; and, Amen I say to you, they receive their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But thou, when thou art doing thy alms, let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>that thine alms may be in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall recompense thee in openness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And when thou prayest, be not as the face-takers, who love to stand in the assemblies and at the corners of the streets to pray, that they may be seen of men; and truly I say to you that they receive their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy secret chamber, and shut thy door, and pray to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father, who seeth in secret, shall reward thee in openness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>And when thou art praying, be not wordy, like the profane; for they think that in much speaking they are heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Be you not like them, for your Father knoweth what is needful for you before that you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Thus pray: Our Father who art in the heavens! be sanctified thy Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Come thy kingdom. Be done thy will, as in heaven, also in earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give to us the bread of our need to-day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>and forgive us our debts, as also we forgive our debtors;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil. For thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory to the age of ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if you forgive men their trespasses, your Father who is in heaven will forgive you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if you will not forgive men, your Father also forgiveth not your trespasses unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>WHEN, too, you fast, be not morosely sad as the assumers of faces, for they defile their countenances so as that they may appear unto men to fast: and, Amen I say unto you, they receive their reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But thou, when thou art fasting, wash thy face and anoint thine head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>that it may not appear to men that thou art fasting, but to thy Father who is in secret; and thy Father who seeth in secret, he shall reward thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>Lay not up for yourselves treasures in the earth, a place where moth and rust corrupt, and where thieves dig through and steal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where no moth and no rust corrupt, and where thieves do not dig through and steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where your treasure is, there also your hearts are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>The lamp of the body is the eye: if thine eye therefore be perfect, thy whole body will be illuminated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>but if thine eye be evil, thy whole body will be dark. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness, what will thy darkness be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>No man can serve two lords; for the one he will hate, and the other he will love, or the one he will honour, and the other he will neglect: you cannot serve Aloha and riches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>WHEREFORE I say unto you, Let not your souls be anxious what you shall eat and what you shall drink, and for your bodies what you shall wear. Is not the life more excellent than food, and the body than raiment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Behold the fowls of the heaven; they sow not, neither do they reap, nor collect into granaries; yet your Father who is in heaven nourisheth them: are you not far more considerable than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>But who among you by being anxious can add to his stature one cubit?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>and concerning raiment why are you anxious? Look upon the lilies of the wilderness how they increase; they toil not, neither do they spin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>Yet I say to you, Not even Shelemun in all his glory was covered like one from among these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>But if the herb of the field, which to-day exists, and tomorrow falleth into the oven, Aloha thus clotheth, how much more you, little of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Be not anxious, therefore, nor say, What shall we eat, or, What shall we drink, or, How shall we be covered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>For after all these things do the people of the world inquire: but your Father who is in heaven knoweth that also by you are required these all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first the kingdom of Aloha and his righteousness, and all these shall be added unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Be not therefore anxious for to-morrow; the morrow shall care for its own: the evil of to-day is enough for it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.7'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.1'>JUDGE not, that you be not judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.2'>For with the judgment that you judge, you shall be judged; and with the measure that you mete, it shall be measured to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>But why dost thou look at the rod that is in thy brother's eye, while the rafter that is in thine own eye thou dost not consider?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.4'>Or how sayest thou to thy brother, Permit that I draw forth the rod from thine eye, and, behold, there is a rafter in thine own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>Hypocrite! draw forth first the rafter from thine own eye, and then thou wilt see to draw forth the rod from thy brother's eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>Give not the holy unto dogs, and throw not your precious stones before swine, lest they trample them under their feet, and turn again and rend you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.7'>Ask, and it shall be given to you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.8'>For every one who asketh receiveth, and he who seeketh findeth; and to him who knocketh it is opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.9'>Or what man from among you, who if his son shall ask bread, will reach forth a stone to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.10'>if a fish he shall ask of him, a serpent will he reach forth to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>If, therefore, you who are evil know to give good gifts unto your children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>All therefore that you will that men shall do unto you, so also do you unto them: for this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>ENTER in at the narrow gate: for wide is the gate, and spacious the way, that conducteth to destruction; and they are many who go therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.14'>How small is the gate, and narrow the way, that leadeth unto salvation; and they are few who find it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>Beware of false prophets, who come to you in the clothing of sheep, but within are ravening wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>By their fruits you shall know them. Do they gather from thorns grapes, or from briers figs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>So every good tree maketh good fruits; but an evil tree maketh evil fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>A good tree cannot make evil fruits, nor an evil tree make good fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.19'>Every tree that maketh not good fruits is cut down, and falleth into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.20'>Wherefore by their fruits you shall know them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.21'>Not every one that saith to me, My Lord, my Lord, entereth into the kingdom of heaven; but he who doeth the will of my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.22'>Multitudes will say to me in that day My Lord, my Lord, in thy name have we not prophesied, and in thy name ejected devils, and in thy name performed many mighty works?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.23'>And then will I confess to them, I never knew you; go far from me, ye workers of iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.24'>Every one therefore who heareth these my words, and doeth them, shall be likened to a wise man, who built his house upon a rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.25'>And the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and rushed against that house, but it fell not, for its foundations were placed upon the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.26'>And every one who heareth these my words, and doeth them not, shall be likened to a man who built his house upon sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.27'>And the rain descended, and the torrents came, and the winds blew, and rushed against that house, and it fell, and the ruin of it was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.28'>And when Jeshu had finished these words, the multitudes wondered at his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.29'>For he taught them as one having power, and not as their scribes and the Pharishee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>WHEN he had descended from the mountain, great multitudes clave to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>And, behold, a certain leper came (and) worshipped him, and said, My Lord, if thou art willing, thou canst cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And Jeshu extended his hand, and touched him, and said, I am willing: be clean; and in that very hour his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jeshu said to him, See that thou tell no man, but go, show thyself to the priests, and offer the oblation that Musha required for their testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>Then when Jeshu had entered into Kapharnachum, a certain centurion approached him, and besought of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>saying, My Lord, my child is lying in the house, paralysed and grievously tormented.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>Jeshu saith to him, I will come and heal him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion answered and saith, My Lord, I am not worthy that thou shouldst come beneath my roof; only speak in a word, and my child shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I also am a man under authority, and under my hand there are soldiers. I say to this one, Go, and he goeth; and to the other, Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jeshu heard this, he was moved with admiration, and said to those with him, Truly I say to you, that in Isroel I have not found faith like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>But I tell you, That many shall come from the east, and from the west, and shall recline with Abraham, and Is'hok, and Jakub, in the kingdom of the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>but the children of the kingdom shall go forth into outer darknesses; there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>And Jeshu said unto the centurion, Go; as thou hast believed, it shall be to thee. And his child was healed in that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>AND Jeshu came to the house of Shemun, and saw his mother-in-law lying, a fever having seized her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>And he touched her with his hand, and the fever left her; and she arose and ministered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>And when it was evening, they brought before him many demoniacs, and he cast out their devils by a word; and all those who were heavily afflicted he healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>So was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Eshaia, who said, That he should take our griefs, and bear our infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Now when Jeshu saw the great multitudes which encompassed him, he commanded that they should go to the opposite shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>And a certain scribe approached him, and said, Rabi, I will come after thee to the place whither thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>Jeshu saith to him, The foxes have their dens, and the fowls of heaven a bower, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>And another from his disciples said to him, My Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jeshu said to him Come after me, and leave the dead ones burying their dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>AND when Jeshu had ascended into the ship, his disciples ascended with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>And, behold, a great commotion was made on the sea, insomuch that the vessel was covered by the waves; but Jeshu himself was asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>And the disciples approached him, that they might awake him, saying to him, Our Lord, deliver us, we are perishing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>And Jeshu said to them, Why are you fearful, you little in faith? Then he arose, and forbade the wind and the sea, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>But the men were struck with wonder, saying, What (being) is this, to whom the winds and the sea are obedient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And when Jeshu came to the other side, to the region of the Godroyee, there met him two demoniacs, who came forth from the place of sepulchres, exceedingly malignant, insomuch that no man could pass by that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>And they shouted, saying, What to us, and to thee, Jeshu, son of Aloha? Hast thou come hither before the time, to torment us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now there was at a distance from them a herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>Those demons, therefore, supplicated from him, saying, If thou cast us out, suffer us to go into the herd of swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>Jeshu saith to them, Go: and immediately they went forth, and entered into the swine; and the whole herd rushed directly over the rock, and, plunging into the sea, perished in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>And they who tended them, fled, and went into the city, and showed every thing that was done, and what concerned these demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>the whole city came forth to meet Jeshu himself; and when they beheld him, they besought from him that he would remove from their coasts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>And he ascended (into) the ship, and went over, and came to his city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>And they brought to him a paralytic lying on a bed; and Jeshu saw their faith, and said to the paralytic, Be comforted, my son, thy sins are forgiven thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>But men from among the scribes said within themselves, This blasphemeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jeshu knew their reasonings, and said to them, Why reason ye evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier, to say, Forgiven are thy sins, or to say, Arise, walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that ye may know that authority hath the Son of man in the earth to remit sins, he saith to him-the paralytic,-Arise, lift up thy bed, and go to thy house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>and he arose (and) went to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>When the assembly saw this, they feared, and glorified Aloha who had given such power as this unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>AND when Jeshu had passed thence, he saw a man who was sitting at the place of the tribute-takers, whose name was Mathai; and he said to him, Come after me; and he arose and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>And while he reclined in the house, there came to him many tribute-gatherers and sinners, and reclined with Jeshu and with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And when the Pharishee saw (it), they say to his disciples, Why doth your master eat with tribute-takers and sinners?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>But Jeshu, when he heard (it), said to them, The healthful have no need for the physician, but they who are diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>Go, learn what that is:-" I require mercy, and not sacrifice; " for I am not come to call the righteous, but the sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then drew nigh to him the disciples of Juchanon, and said, Why do we and the Pharishee fast much, and thy disciples fast not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>Jeshu said to them, Neither can the sons of the marriage-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them: but the days are coming when the bridegroom shall be taken up from them, and then shall they fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No man inserteth a piece of new cloth upon an old garment, lest he should take away its fulness from that garment, and the rent be greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Neither do they pour new wine into old bottles, that the bottles may not be broken, and the wine be spilled, and the bottles perish. But they pour new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>WHILE he spake these words with them, a certain chief came, drew near, worshipped him, and said, My daughter is now dead; but come, lay thy hand upon her, and she shall live!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>And Jeshu arose, with his disciples, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And, behold, a woman whose blood had flowed twelve years, came behind him, and touched the edge of his vestment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>For she was saying within herself, If I touch but his garment, I shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>But Jeshu turned and seeth her, and said to her, Be comforted, my daughter, thy faith hath saved thee. And the woman was healed from that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And Jeshu came to the ruler's house, and saw the minstrels and the crowds which were making a tumult.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>And he said to them, Retire; for the damsel is not dead, but asleep. And they laughed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>And when he had put forth the crowds, he entered, and took her by the hand; and the damsel arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>And the rumour of this went forth through all that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>AND when Jeshu had passed thence, two blind men clave to him, and besought him, and said, Have compassion on us, Son of David!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>And when he had come into the house, these blind men were brought to him. Jeshu saith to them, Believe you that I am able to do this? They say to him, Yes, our Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then he touched their eyes, and said, As you believe be it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>And immediately their eyes were opened. And Jeshu forbad them and said, Beware lest any man know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they went forth and spread the report of it through all that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>And when Jeshu went forth, they brought to him a dumb person in whom was a demon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>And when the demon had gone out, the dumb spake; and the multitudes were astonished, and said, Never was it thus seen in Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharishee said, By the chief of the devils he casteth out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>And Jeshu itinerated in all their cities and villages, and taught in their assemblies, and preached the gospel of the kingdom, and healed all diseases and all pains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>BUT when Jeshu saw the multitudes, he had compassion upon them, because they fainted and were dispersed as sheep that had no shepherd;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>and said to his disciples, The harvest is great, and the labourers few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>Ask, therefore, from the Lord of the harvest, that he would thrust forth labourers into his harvest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And he called his twelve disciples, and gave them power over unclean spirits to cast them out, and to cure every disease and infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.2'>Now, of the twelve apostles the names are these: the first of them, Shemun who is called Kipha, and Andreas his brother, and Jakubbar-Zabdai, and Juchanon his brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.3'>and Philipos, and Bar-Tholmai, and Thoma, and Mathai the tribute-gatherer, and Jakubbar-Chalphai, and Labi who was surnamed Thadai,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.4'>and Shemun the zealous, and Jihuda S'carjuta, he who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.5'>These twelve Jeshu sent, and commanded them and said, In the way of the heathens go not, and into the city of the Shomroyee do not enter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.6'>but go rather unto the sheep which have perished from the house of Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.7'>And as you go, proclaim and say that the kingdom of heaven hath drawn near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.8'>The diseased heal, the lepers cleanse, the dead raise, and the demons cast forth. Freely you have received, freely give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.9'>Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.10'>nor a wallet for the road; neither two tunics, nor sandals, nor staff: for worthy is the workman of his meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.11'>And into whatsoever city or town you enter, inquire who is worthy in it, and there be till you depart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.12'>And when you enter into the house, invoke peace for the house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.13'>and if the house be worthy, your peace shall come upon it; but if it be not worthy, your peace upon yourselves shall revert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.14'>But whosoever doth not receive you or hear your words, when you depart from that house, or that town, set free the dust from your feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.15'>And, Amen, I say unto you, that for the land of Sadum and of Amura it will be more tolerable, in the day of the judgment, than for that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.16'>LO, I send you forth as sheep among wolves: be you, therefore, wise as serpents and guileless as doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.17'>But beware of the sons of men; for, delivering you to the house of judgments, in their synagogues they will scourge you,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.7'>And another fell among the thorns, and the thorns sprang up and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.8'>And another fell into good earth, and gave fruits, this a hundred, another sixty, and another thirty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.14'>and accomplished in them is the prophecy of Eshaia, who said, that hearing they should hear, but not understand, and seeing they should see, but not know.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.22'>That sown the place of thorns, is he who heareth the word, but the anxious thought of this world and the illusions of riches stifle the word in him, and he is without fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.23'>But that which upon good ground was sown is he who heareth my doctrine, and understandeth (it), and giveth fruits, and produceth, whether a hundred, or sixty, or thirty fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.24'>ANOTHER comparison he allegorized unto them, and said: The kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who sowed good seed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.25'>And while men slept, came his adversary, and sowed zizania among the wheat, and went.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.29'>But he said to them, (No,) lest, when ye gather the zizania, you root out with them the wheat also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.30'>Leave (them), that both may grow together till the harvest; and in the season of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the zizania, and bind them (together in) bundles, that they may burn; but the wheat collect into my barns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.31'>Another comparison allegorized he to them, and said: The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard, which a man took and sowed in his field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.32'>This is less than all other seeds; but when it has grown, it is greater than all herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the fowl of the heavens come (and) build in its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.33'>Another parable he spake to them: The kingdom of heaven resembles that leaven which a woman took and hid in three satas of meal, until the whole was leavened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.34'>All these spake Jeshu in parables to the multitude; and without a parable he did not speak with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.35'>That there should be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, who said, I will open my mouth in comparisons, and pour forth things hidden from before the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then Jeshu dismissed the multitudes, and came into the house; and his disciples drew near him, and said to him, Expound to us the comparison of the zizania of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>He answered and said to them, He who sowed the good seed is the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.38'>The field is the world. Now, the good seed are the sons of the kingdom, but the zizania are the sons of the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.39'>The adversary who sowed them is Satana; the harvest is the consummation of the world; the reapers are the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.40'>As, therefore, the zizania are gathered and burned in the fire, so shall it be in the completion of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.41'>The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall collect from his kingdom all those who cause offence, and all (who) work iniquity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.42'>and shall throw them into a furnace of fire; there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.43'>Then the just shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.44'>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure which was hidden in a field, (and) which a man found and concealed, and from joy went and sold all that he had, and bought that field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.45'>Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man a merchant, who sought goodly pearls;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>Jeshu answered, and said to them, Why also do ye transgress the commandment of Aloha for the sake of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For Aloha hath said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and whoso curseth his father or his mother, to die he shall die:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.36'>And he took those seven loaves and the fishes, and offered praise, and brake, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples gave to the multitudes;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>But Jeshu knew, and said to them, Why reason you within yourselves, little in faith, because bread you have not brought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Have you not yet understood? Do you not remember those five loaves for the five thousand, and how many panniers you took up?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.16'>Shemun Kipha answered and said, Thou art the Meshicha, Son of Aloha the Living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.17'>Jeshu responded and said to him, Blessed art thou, Shemun-bar-Jona; because flesh and blood have not revealed (this) to thee, but my Father who is in heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.10'>See that you contemn not one of these little ones: for I say unto you that their angels in all time are beholding the face of my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.11'>For the Son of man is come to save that which had perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.12'>How doth it appear to you? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them shall wander from them, doth he not leave the ninety and nine on the mountain, and, going, seek that which had wandered?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.13'>And if he shall find it, assuredly I tell you that he rejoiceth in it more than (in) the ninety and nine which wandered not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.14'>So it is not good before your Father who is in heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.15'>NOW if thy brother offend against thee, go, and argue (the matter) between thyself and him alone; and if he hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.16'>But if he hear thee not, take with thee one or two, that upon the mouth of two or three witnesses may be established every word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.17'>And if, also, he will not hear them, tell the church; but if he will neither hear the church, let him be to thee as a publican and as a heathen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.23'>THEREFORE is the kingdom of the heavens likened to a royal person who would take the account from his servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.24'>And when he began to receive, they brought to him one who owed a myriad talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.25'>And when he had nothing to pay, his lord commanded that they should sell (both) himself, his wife, and his children, and all that he had, and to pay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.26'>And that servant fell and worshipped him, saying, My lord, be patient of spirit toward me, and all things I (will) pay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.27'>And the lord of that servant had mercy, and absolved him, and forgave him his debt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>Then went forth that servant, and found one of his fellows who owed him a hundred pence; and he seized him, strangling, and saying to him, Give me what thou owest to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>But he would not, but went and threw him into the house of the chained until he should have rendered him what he owed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>When their fellow-servants saw what was done, they were greatly grieved, and went and declared to their lord all that was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then his lord summoned him and said to him, Evil servant! all that debt did I forgive thee, because thou didst entreat me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>Oughtest thou not to have been as gracious to thy fellow-servant as I was gracious unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>And his lord was indignant, and delivered him to the tormentors, until he should have paid all whatsoever he owed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.35'>Thus will your heavenly Father deal with you unless you forgive each his brother from your heart his trespasses.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.20'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.1'>FOR the kingdom of heaven is like a man, a house-lord, who went forth in the early morn to hire labourers for his vinery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.2'>And he bargained with the labourers for a denarius a day, and sent them into his vinery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.3'>And he went forth in three hours, and saw others who were standing in the public place and unemployed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.4'>And he said to them, Go also you in the vinery, and what is suitable I will give you. Then went they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.5'>And he went forth again in six and nine hours, and did the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.6'>And about eleven hours he went out, and found others who were standing and unemployed; and he said to them, Why are you standing all the day unemployed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.7'>They say to him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to them, Go also you into the vinery, and whatever is suitable you shall receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.8'>But when it was evening, the lord of the vinery said to the chief of his household, Call the workmen and give to them their wages; and begin from the last unto the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.9'>And they came who (had wrought) from eleven hours; and they received each a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.10'>But when the first came, they expected to take more; but they also received each a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.11'>And when they had received, they murmured against the house-lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.12'>and said, These last have wrought one hour, and thou hast made them equal with us, who have borne the burden of the day and its heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.13'>But he answered and said to one of them, My friend, I am not unjust towards thee: didst thou not bargain with me for a denarius?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.14'>Take what is thine and go: I will unto these last to give as unto thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.15'>Is it not lawful for me that whatsoever l am willing, I may do with mine own? Is thine eye evil because I am good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.16'>Thus the last shall be first, and the first last; for many are the called, but few the chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.17'>NOW Jeshu was about to go up to Urishlem, and he took his twelve disciples by themselves in the way, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.18'>Behold, we go up to Urishlem, and the Son of man is betrayed to the chief priests and to the scribes, and they shall condemn him to the death;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.20'>Then came to him the mother of the sons of Zabdai, she and her sons, and worshipped him, and supplicated a certain thing of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.21'>But he said to her, What wilt thou? She said to him, Declare that these my two sons shall sit, one at thy right hand, and one at thy left, in thy kingdom.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.23'>He saith to them, My cup you shall drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized you shall be baptized: but that you may sit at my right hand, and at my left, is not mine to give, unless to them for whom it is prepared by my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.24'>And when the ten heard it, they were indignant against those two brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.25'>And Jeshu called them, and said to them, You know that the princes of the Gentiles are their lords, and their great ones exercise power over them;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.20.29'>AND when Jeshu went forth from Jirichu, a great multitude cometh after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.30'>And, behold, two blind men were sitting by the side of the way; and when they heard that Jeshu was passing, they gave voice, saying, Be merciful upon us, my Lord, Son of David!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.31'>But the crowds rebuked them that they should be silent; but they lifted up their voice the more, saying, Our Lord, be merciful upon us, O Son of David!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.32'>And Jeshu stood and called them, and said, What will you that I should do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.33'>They say to him, Our Lord, that our eyes may be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.20.34'>And he had compassion on them, and touched their eyes, and immediately their eyes were opened, and they went after him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>AND when he drew nigh to Urishlem, and had come to Beth-phage, at the mount of Olives, Jeshu sent two of his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>and said to them, Go to this village which is over against you, and you shall at once find an ass tied, and her colt with her; loose and bring (them) to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>And if any one say ought to you, say to him that it is requested for our Lord, and immediately he will send them hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>But all this was done that there should be fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>Tell you the daughter of Tsheum, Behold, thy king cometh to thee, lowly, and riding on an ass, and on a colt the foal of an ass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>Then the disciples went, and did as Jeshu had commanded them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>and brought the ass and the colt, and laid upon the colt their clothes, and Jeshu rode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>And many of the crowds spread their vestments in the way; and others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed them in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>But the throngs who went before him, and came after him, cried out and said, Ushana to the son of David! blessed be He who cometh in the name of the Lord! Ushana in the heights!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>And when he had entered Urishlem, the whole city was commoved, and said, Who is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>But the multitude answered, This is Jeshu, the prophet who is from Natsrath of Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>And Jeshu went into the temple of Aloha, and cast out all those who sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables of the money-changers, and the seats of those who sold doves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>and said to them, It is written, that my house shall the house of prayer be called, but ye have made it a den of thieves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>But when the chief priests and Pharishee saw the wondrous things which he did, and the children who were crying in the temple, and saying, Ushana to the son of David, they were displeased with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>saying to him, Hearest thou what these say? Jeshu saith to them, Yes: have ye not read, that from the mouth of children and of babes thou hast prepared praise?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>But in the early morn, as he returned to the city, he hungered:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>and he saw a certain fig-tree in the way, and came to it, but found nothing thereon but leaves only; and he said, Let there be no fruit upon thee again for ever. And immediately that fig-tree withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>And the disciples saw, and were astonished, saying, How in a moment is the fig-tree withered!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>Jeshu answered and said to them, Amen I say to you, that if faith were in you, and you did not hesitate, you should not only do (as) to this fig-tree, but also were you to say to this mountain, Be thou lifted up and fall into the sea, it should be done.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>BUT how doth appear to you? a certain man had two sons; and he came to the elder, and said to him, My son, go to-day work in the vinery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.29'>But he answered and said, I am not willing: yet afterwards he relented, and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>He came to the other, and said likewise. He answered and said, I (will), my lord; yet went not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>Which of these two did the will of his father? They say to him, The elder. Jeshu saith to them, Amen I tell you, the tribute-takers and harlots go before you into the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>Hear another comparison: A certain man was a house-lord; and he planted a vinery, and surrounded it with an hedge, and dug a wine-press in it, and built in it a tower, and had it taken by labourers, and journeyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.34'>And when the time of fruits drew near, he sent his servants to the husbandmen, that they might send him of the fruits of his vinery.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.36'>And again he sent other servants more than the first, and they acted towards them likewise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>last, he sent to them his son, saying, Now will they be ashamed from my son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>But the husbandmen, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and take the inheritance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>When the lord of the vinery, therefore, cometh, what will he do to these husbandmen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They say to him, Most miserably will he destroy them, and the vinery will he cause to be held by other labourers, (even) such as will give him the fruits in their seasons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>Jeshu saith to them, Have you not read in the scripture, that the stone which the builders rejected, this is become the head of the corner? By the Lord was this done, and it is wondrous in our eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.43'>On this account I tell you, that the kingdom of Aloha is taken from you, and shall be given to a people who will yield fruits.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.12'>And he said to him, My friend, how didst thou enter here, when thou hast not the vestments of the feast? But he was silent.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>And they sent to him their disciples with (certain) of the household of Herodes, saying to him, Doctor, we know that thou art resolutely true, and (that) the way of Aloha in truth thou teachest; neither carriest thou fear for man, for thou acceptest not the person of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>Tell us then, how doth it appear to thee? is it lawful to give head-money unto Cesar or not?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>And Jeshu said to them, Whose are this image and inscription?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>And when they heard, they wondered, and left him, and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>IN that (same) day came the Zadukoyee, affirming to him, (that) there is no life for the dead. And they questioned him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>saying to him, Doctor, Musha has said to us that if a man die having no children, his brother shall take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>But there were with us seven brethren: the eldest (of whom) took a wife, and died. And because he had no children, he left his wife unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>So also did he who was second, and he who was the third, and unto the seventh of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>But the last of all the woman also is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>In the resurrection, therefore, of whom from these seven shall she be the wife? for all had taken her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>Jeshu answered and said to them, You do err, because you understand not the scriptures nor the power of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>For in the resurrection of the dead, they take not wives, neither are wives to husbands; but as the angels of Aloha in heaven are they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read that which has been spoken to you by Aloha, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>I am the God of Abraham, the God of Is'hok, the God of Jakub? But Aloha is not of those who are dead, but of those who are alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>And when the multitudes heard, they were wonder-struck at his doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>BUT when the Pharishee heard that he had silenced the Zadukoyee, they gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>And one from them, who was skilful in the law, questioned him, tempting him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>Doctor, which commandment is greatest in the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jeshu said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy Aloha with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the commandment, the great and the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>And the second is like unto it, That thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>On these two commandments hang the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>while the Pharishee were gathered together, Jeshu questioned them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>and said, What say you concerning the Meshicha,-whose son? They say to him, Son of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>Saith he to them, And how doth David in spirit call him THE LORD? For he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>that the Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand until I put thine adversaries beneath thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If, then, David calleth him the Lord, how is he his son?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.35'>For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I thirsted, and you made me to drink; I was a stranger, and you received me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.36'>I was naked, and you covered me; I was sick, and you cared for me; and I was in prison, and you came to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.37'>Then shall say unto him those righteous, Our Lord! when did we see that thou wast hungry, and fed thee, or that thou didst thirst, and we gave thee drink?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.25.45'>Then shall he answer and say to them, Amen I say unto you, that inasmuch as you did it not unto one of these little ones, you did it not to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.25.46'>And these shall go away into the torment which is eternal, and the just into the life which is eternal.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>AND when Jeshu had finished all these discourses, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>You know not that after two days is the Petzcha, and the Son of man is delivered up to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then assembled the chief priests, and the scribes, and the elders of the people, in the hall of the chief of the priests, who was called Kaiapha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>And they held counsel concerning Jeshu, how that by artifice they might apprehend and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>And they said, Let it not be on the festival, lest there be a tumult among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>And when Jeshu was at Bethania, in the house of Shemun the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>there drew near to him a woman who carried a vase of aromatic balsam, great of price, and she poured it upon the head of Jeshu as he reclined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But his disciples saw and were displeased, and said, For what is this destruction?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this could have been sold for much, and given to the poor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jeshu knew, and said to them, Why grieve you the woman? a good work hath she wrought upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For in all time the poor you have with you, but me you have not in all time with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For this (woman) who hath poured this balsam upon my body, as unto my funeral hath done .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>And Amen I say unto you, Wheresoever this my Gospel shall be proclaimed, in all the world, this also which she hath done shall be told for her memorial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then went one from the twelve, named Jihuda S'carjuta, unto the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said to then, What are you willing to give me, and I will deliver him to you? But they settled to him thirty of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that time he sought to him opportunity to betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>BUT in the first day of the (Phatiree) unleavened-bread days, the disciples came to Jeshu, and said to him, Where wilt thou that we prepare for thee to eat the passover?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>But he said to them, Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, Our master saith, My time hath come! with thee will I perform the passover with my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jeshu had commanded, and prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And when it was evening, he reclined with his twelve disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And while they were eating, he said, Amen I say unto you, that one from you betrayeth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And they were very sad, and began to say to him, one by one of them, My Lord, is it I?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>But he answered and said, One who dippeth his hand with me in the dish, he shall betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>And the Son of man goeth as it is written concerning him; but woe to him, to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! Better had it been for that man if he had not been born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Then Jihuda the traitor answered and said, Am not I (he), Rabi? Jeshu replieth to him, Thou hast said!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>But while they were eating, Jeshu took the bread, and blessed, and brake, and gave to his disciples, and said, Take, eat, this (is) my body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And he took the cup, and offered thanks, and gave to them, and said, Take, drink of this all of you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>this (is) my blood of the new covenant, which for multitudes is shed for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, that I will not drink from henceforth of this product of the vines, until the day in which I shall drink it with you new in the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And they sang praises, and went forth unto the mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>THEN said Jeshu unto them, You all shall be offended in me this night; for it is written, I will strike the shepherd, and scattered shall be the sheep of his flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after that I am risen I am before you in Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Kipha answered and said to him, Though every man should be offended in thee, I never will be offended in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jeshu saith to him, Amen I say to thee, that in this night, before the cock shall crow, three times thou wilt deny me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Kipha saith to him, If I am to die with thee, I will not deny thee. The same also all the disciples said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then cometh Jeshu with them unto the place which is called Gedsiman; and he said to his disciples, Sit here while I go and pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And he took Kipha and the two sons of Zabdai; and he began to be sorrowful, and to be vehemently agonized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>And he said to them, My soul is afflicted unto death; wait for me here, and watch with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And he removed a little, and fell upon his face, praying, and saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; yet not as I will, but as thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Then he came to his disciples, and found them sleeping; and he said to Kipha, How, could you not for one hour watch with me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Be watchful and pray, that you enter not into temptation. The spirit is ready, but the body is infirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again he went the second time, and prayed, and said, My Father, if it be not possible for this cup to pass, unless I drink it, be done thy will!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And he came again, and found them asleep; for their eyes had become heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And he left them, and went again, and prayed the third time, and said the same word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples, and said to them, Sleep on now, and be at rest; lo, the hour cometh, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Arise, let us go: behold, he cometh who betrayeth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he was speaking, behold, Jihuda the traitor, one from the twelve, came, and a great multitude with him, with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>And Jihuda the traitor had given to them a sign, and said, Whomsoever I shall kiss, that is he: take him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And immediately he approached Jeshu, and said, Peace, my master! and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>But he, Jeshu, said to him, (Is it) for that thou hast come, my companion? Then they came on, and laid their hands upon Jeshu, and took him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And, behold, one from those who were with Jeshu stretched forth his hand, and unsheathed a sword, and struck a servant of the high priest, and took off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then said Jeshu to him, Return thy sword to his place; for every one of them who take swords, by swords shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or thinkest thou that I cannot request from my Father, and he shall appoint to me now more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>(But) how, then, would the scripture be accomplished, that thus it ought to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jeshu said to the multitudes, As against a robber are you come out, with swords, and with clubs, to seize me? Every day with you in the temple I sat and taught, and you did not apprehend me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But this was done that what is written in the prophets might be fulfilled. Then the disciples all deserted him, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And they who apprehended Jeshu led him unto Kaiapha, chief of the priests, where the jurists and elders were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Shemun Kipha went after him from afar unto the court of the chief of the priests, and entered and sat within with the attendants, that he might see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>But the chief priests, and the elders, and the whole assembly, sought against Jeshu witnesses, that they might put him to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>but they found not (any). And many witnesses of falsehood came. But, last, two came near,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>declaring, This said, I can destroy the temple of Aloha, and in three days rebuild it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the chief of the priests arose, and said to him, Dost thou return no word? What are these witnessing against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jeshu was silent. And the chief of the priests answered and said to him, I swear thee, by Aloha the Living, that thou declare to us whether thou be the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jeshu saith to him, Thou hast said: but I say to you, That hereafter ye shall see him, the Son of man, sitting at the right hand of Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the chief of the priests tore his robes, and said, Behold, he hath blasphemed! what further need have we of witnesses? Behold, now we have heard his blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What will you? They answered saying, He deserves death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then did they spit in his face, and smote him; and others struck him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, Prophesy to us, Meshicha! Who is he that smiteth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>But Kipha was sitting without, in the hall, and a certain female domestic approached him, saying to him, Thou also wast with Jeshu Natsroia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied before all, and said, I know not what thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he had gone out into the vestibule, another saw him, and said to them, This also was there with Jeshu Natsroia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied with oaths, I know not the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>But, after a little while, they who were standing drew near, and said to Kipha, Assuredly thou art of them; for thy speech also makes thee known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then began he to imprecate and to swear, I know not the man! And in that hour the cock crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Kipha remembered the word of Jeshu, who had said to him, That before the cock shall crow, three times wilt thou have denied me. And he went without, and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>BUT when it was morning, the chief priests and elders of the people took counsel against Jeshu, how they should put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And they bound him, and led him away, and delivered him to Pilatos the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Jihuda the traitor, when he saw that Jeshu was condemned, repented him, and went hastily, and returned those thirty of silver unto the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>and said, I have sinned, for I have betrayed the innocent blood. But they said to him, To us? what to us? Thou knowest,-thou!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And he cast down the silver in the temple, and passed away, and went and strangled himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests took up the silver, and said, It is not lawful that we throw it into the place of offering, because it is the price of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And they took counsel, and bought with it the field of the potter, for the burial-place of strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Wherefore that field has been called, The field of blood, until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet, who said, And I took the thirty (pieces) of silver, the price of him who was precious, whom the sons of Isroel bargained for;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and gave them for the field of the potter, as the Lord commanded me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>But Jeshu himself stood before the governor. And the governor questioned him, and said to him, Thou art the king of the Jihudoyee? Jeshu said to him, Thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And while the chief priests and elders were accusing him, he returned not a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then said Pilatos unto him, Hearest thou not what they witness against thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But he gave him no answer, no, not in one word; and upon this (Pilate) marvelled greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at every festival the governor was accustomed to release one of the bound unto the people, whomsoever they would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>But there was (then) bound a notorious prisoner who was called Bar-aba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>And when they were assembled, Pilatos said to them, Whom will you that I release unto you, Bar-aba, or Jeshu who is called the Meshicha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For Pilatos knew that from malice they had delivered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>But while the governor sat upon his tribunal, his wife sent to him saying, Let there be nothing between thee and that Just One; for much have I suffered in a dream to-day on his account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the multitude that he should release to them Bar-aba, that they might destroy Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>And the governor answered and said to them, Whom will you that I shall release to you of these two? Then they said, Bar-aba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilatos saith to them, And to Jeshu who is called the Meshicha, what shall I do with him? They all said, Let him be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>Pilatos saith to them, Why, what evil hath he done? But they clamoured the more, and said, Let him be crucified!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>Then Pilatos, when he saw that nothing availed, but that the tumult became greater, took waters (and) washed his hands before the assembly, and said, I am expiated from the blood of this Just One. You shall know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered and said, His blood upon us, and upon our children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>THEN he released to them Bar-aba; and scourged Jeshu with thongs, and delivered him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jeshu to the Praetorium, and the whole cohort gathered against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And they stripped him, and invested him with a cloak of crimson.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>And they interwove a crown of thorns, and set it upon his head, and a cane in his right hand: and they kneeled upon their knees before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, king of the Jihudoyee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And they did spit in his face, and took the cane, and struck him upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had derided him, they stripped him of the cloak, and clothed him with his own garments, and led him away to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And when they had gone forth, they found a Kurinean man whose name was Shemun: this (man) they compel to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And they came to a place which is called Gogultho, which is expounded, The skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>And they gave him to drink vinegar mingled with gall: and he tasted, but was not willing to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments by lot: that what was spoken by the prophet might be fulfilled, They parted my garments among them, and upon my vesture did they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And they sat down and watched him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they placed over his head the occasion of his death, in the writing, This (is) Jeshu, the King of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>AND they crucified with him two thieves, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>But they who passed by railed against him, moving their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, Destroyer of the temple, and builder of it in three days! deliver thyself, if thou art the Son of Aloha, and come down from the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders and Pharishee, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Isroel, let him now descend from the cross, that we may see and believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted upon Aloha; let him liberate him now, if he delighteth in him; for he said, I am the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>Likewise also the robbers who were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>BUT from the sixth hour there was darkness upon all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jeshu cried with a high voice, Aloha! Aloha! why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>But certain of them who stood there, when they heard, said, This hath cried unto Ilio.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And forthwith ran one from them, and took a sponge, and filled it with vinegar, and set it upon a cane, and gave him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the rest said, Let alone, we will see whether Ilio (will) come to deliver him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>But he, Jeshu, again cried with a high voice, and dismissed his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And at once the veil of the temple was rent in twain from above to beneath; and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were riven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>And the house of the buried was opened; and the bodies of many of the saints who had been asleep arose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and came forth, and after his resurrection went into the holy city, and were seen by many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>But the centurion and those with him, who guarded Jeshu, when they saw the commotion and those (portents) which took place, feared greatly, and said, Assuredly this was the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>(And) many women were there, beholding from afar; those who had come after Jeshu from Galila, and had ministered unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>One of them was Mariam Magdolitha, and Mariam the mother of Jakub and of Josi, and the mother of the sons of Zabdai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>BUT when it was evening, there came a rich man from Rometha, whose name was Jauseph, who himself also was a disciple of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This went unto Pilatos, and begged the body of Jeshu. And Pilatos commanded that the body should be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Jauseph took the body, and wound it round in a cloth of pure linen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and laid it in a new house of burial of his own, which was hewn out in the rock. And they rolled a great stone, and heaved it against the door of the sepulchre, and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Now there were there Mariam Magdolitha and the other Mariam, who were sitting over against the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>BUT the day which was next after the preparation, the chief priests and Pharishee came together unto Pilatos,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying to him, Our lord, we remember that that impostor said while alive, That after three days I will arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Command therefore that they watch the sepulchre till (after) the third of the days; lest his disciples come, and steal him away by night, and tell the people that from the house of the dead he has risen, and the last delusion be worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilatos saith to them, Ye have guards; go, watch diligently, as ye know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went, and set a watch (about) the sepulchre, and sealed the stone along with the guards.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>FROM the evening (end) of the sabbath, when the first (day) in the week was lightening, Mariam Magdolitha and the other Mariam came to see the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And, behold, there was a great earthquake; for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven and drew near, rolled the stone from the door, and sat upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His aspect was like lightning, and his raiment was white as the snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And with fear of him they who were watching were shaken, and became as the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the angel answered and said to the women, Fear not ye; for I know that for Jeshu who was crucified you are seeking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here: for he is risen, even as he said. Come, see the place in which our Lord was laid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>and go with speed, and tell his disciples that he is risen from the house of the dead; and, behold, he goeth before you into Galila. There shall you see him. Lo, I have told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they went quickly from the sepulchre, with fear and with great joy, and ran that they might tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And, behold, Jeshu met them, and said to them, Peace to you! And they approached, held him by the feet, and adored him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then said Jeshu to them, Fear not; but go tell my brethren, that I will go into Galila, and there they shall see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>But while they went, there came certain from those guards into the city, and told the chief priests every thing that had been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And they assembled with the elders, and took counsel; and they gave money not a little to the guards,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>telling them, Say you that his disciples came (and) stole him away in the night, while we slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this be heard before the governor, we will persuade him, and make you without care.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>But they, when they had received the money, did as they had instructed them; and that saying went forth among the Jihudoyee until to-day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>But the eleven disciples went into Galila, unto the mountain where Jeshu had appointed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>And when they saw him, they worshipped him; but from them some had doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jeshu drew near, and discoursed with them, and said to them, There is given unto me all power in heaven and in earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>As the Father sent me, so also I send you. Go therefore, disciple all nations, and baptize them in the name (of) the Father, and (of) the Son, and (of) the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>And teach them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. And, behold, I am with you all the days, until the consummation of the world. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>THE beginning of the Gospel of Jeshu Meshicha, the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in Eshaia the prophet: Behold, I send my angel before thy face, Who shall make straight thy way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice which crieth in the desert, Prepare the way of the Lord, Make level his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>Juchanon was in the desert, baptizing, and proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the region of Jehud and all the sons of Urishlem went out to him; and he baptized them in Jurdan the river, while they were confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>But Juchanon himself was clothed with a garment of the hair of camels, and engirded with a belt of leather upon his loins; and his food was locusts and wilderness honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he proclaimed and said, Behold, (One) cometh after me, who is mightier than I; he, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to bow myself to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you with waters; but he shall baptize you with the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it was in those days that Jeshu came from Natsrath of Galila, and was baptized in Jurdan by Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And as soon as he had ascended from the waters, he saw the heavens part asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descend upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And the voice was from the heavens, Thou art my Son, the Beloved: in thee I have delighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit led him forth into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was there in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satana: and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>BUT after Juchanon was delivered up, Jeshu came to Galila, and proclaimed the annunciation of the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>And he said, The time is complete; the kingdom of Aloha cometh: repent, and believe the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And while he walked about the sea of Galila, he saw Shemun and Andreas his brother, who were casting nets into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jeshu said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And at once they forsook their nets, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And when he had passed on a little, he saw Jakub bar Zabdai and Juchanon his brother; and they also were in a vessel, preparing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And he called them; and forthwith they left Zabdai their father with the hirelings, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And when they were come to Kapher-nachum, he forthwith taught on the sabbaths in their assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they wondered at his doctrine; for he taught them as having power, and not as their Sophree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And there was in their assembly a man who had an unclean spirit: and he cried</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>and said, What to us and to thee, Jeshu Natsroya? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jeshu restrained him, and said, Close thy mouth, and come forth from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the impure spirit threw him down, and cried with a high voice, and went forth from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And all wondered, and questioned one with another, Who is this? and what is this new doctrine? because with authority he commandeth the impure spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And his fame soon went out through all the region of Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And he proceeded from the assembly, and came to the house of Shemun and Andreas with Jacub and Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>And the mother-in-law of Shemun was lying in a fever; and they told him concerning her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he approached, took her by her hand; and she arose, and at once the fever left her, and she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Then in the evening at sun-setting they brought to him all those who were grievously affected and demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole city was assembled at the gate:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>and he healed multitudes who were grievously affected with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and would not permit the demons to speak; for they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>AND in the morning he arose long before (day), and went into a solitude, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Shemun and (they) who (were) with him sought for him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and when they had found him, they said to him, All men are seeking thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>He said to them, Proceed you to the neighbouring towns and cities; for there also I will preach, because for this am I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he preached in all their assemblies in all Galila, and cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper came to him, and fell at his feet, and besought him, and said to him, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jeshu had compassion on him, and stretched forth his hand, touched him, and said, I will, be clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And in that very hour his leprosy went from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he restrained him, and led him forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and said to him, See lest thou tell any one; but go, show thyself to the priests, and offer the oblation for thy purification as Musha commanded for their testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he, when he was gone forth, began to announce it much, and so divulged the matter as that Jeshu could not go openly in the city, but was without in a solitary part: and they came to him from every place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>AND Jeshu entered again into Kapher-nachum for some days. And when they had heard that he was in the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>many were gathered together, so that it could not contain them, nor yet (the space) before the gate; and he spake with them the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came to him, and brought him a paralytic borne between four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not approach him for the crowd, they ascended to the roof, and took the covering from the place where Jeshu was, and let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jeshu saw their faith, he said to the paralytic himself, My son, forgiven to thee are thy sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But some of the Sophree and Pharishee were there, who sat and reasoned in their heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Who is this uttering blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but One, Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>But Jeshu knew in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, and said to them, Why reason you these things in your heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Forgiven are thy sins, or to say, Arise, lift up thy couch, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But, that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he arose at once, and took up his couch, and went forth before them all; so that all wondered, and glorified Aloha, saying, Never saw we thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>AND he went forth again to the sea; and the whole multitude came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And when he had passed, he saw Levi bar Chalphai sitting among the publicans: and he said to him, Come after me; and arising, he went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And while he reclined in the house, many publicans and sinners reclined with Jeshu and with his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the Sophree and Pharishee, when they saw him eat with publicans and with sinners, said to his disciples, Why with publicans and with sinners doth he eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>But when Jeshu heard, he said to them, The healthy have no need of the physician, but they who are sorely affected: I have not come to call the righteous but the sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Now the disciples of Juchanon and of the Pharishee fasted. And they came and said to him, (While) the disciples of Juchanon and of the Pharishee fast, why do not thy disciples fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jeshu said to them, Can the sons of the marriage-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? No;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>but the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken up from them: then shall they fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No man inserteth a new piece, and seweth it upon an old vestment; lest that new should take away its fulness from the old, and make the rent the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; lest the wine rend the bottles, and the bottles perish, and the wine be spilled: but they put new vine into new bottles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>AND it was that, as Jeshu went among the grain, his disciples walked and plucked the ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharishee said to him, See how on the shabath they do what is not lawful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>Jeshu saith to them, Have you never read what David did, when he needed and was hungry, he, and they (who were) with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered the house of Aloha, when Abiathar was high priest, and did eat the bread of the table of the Lord, that which it is not lawful except for the priests to eat, and gave also to those who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, that the shabath on account of the Son of man was made, and not the Son of man on account of the shabath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>The Son of man, therefore, is the Lord also of the shabath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And Jeshu again entered the congregation: and a certain man was there whose hand was withered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>and they watched him whether he would cure him on the shabath, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he said to him, the man with the withered hand, Stand up in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>He said also to them, Is it lawful on the shabath to do good, or (that) which (is) evil? to save life, or to destroy it? But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And he beheld them with indignation, while it grieved him on account of the hardness of their hearts. And he said to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched (it); and his hand straightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharishee went out immediately, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jeshu with his disciples went towards the sea: and many people joined him from Galila, and from Jehud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Urishlem, and from Edum, and from beyond Jurdan, and from Tsur, and from Tsaidon; great multitudes, who, having heard all that he had done, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples to bring a vessel for him, that the crowds might not oppress him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>for he had healed multitudes, until they were falling upon him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And they who were troubled with impure spirits, when they saw him, fell down, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he strongly prohibited them to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>AND he ascended a mountain, and called those whom he willed; and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he chose twelve to be with him, and to send them to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he named to Shemun the name of Kipha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and upon Jacub bar Zabdai, and Juchanon the brother of Jacub, he set the name of B'nai-regesh, which is, (B'nai-râmo,) Sons of thunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>And Andreas, and Philipos, and Bar-Thulmai, and Mathai, and Thoma, and Jacub bar Chalphai, and Thadai, and Shemun the Zealous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Jihuda S'carjuta,-he who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And they came to the house: and the assemblies gathered again, so that they could not eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And his relatives heard, and came forth to take him; for they said, He hath gone out of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the Sophree, they who had come down from Urishlem, said, Belzebub is in him, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And Jeshu called them, and by similitudes said to them, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>For if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom cannot stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>and if a house against itself be divided, that house cannot stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>and if Satan rise against Satan, and be divided, he cannot stand, but his end is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one can enter into the house of the strong, and spoil his goods, unless first the strong one he bind; and then his house he may destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Amen I say to you, That all sin and blasphemy which the sons of men blaspheme may be remitted them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Spirit of Holiness hath no remission for ever, but is condemned to the judgment that is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Because they had said that an unclean spirit was in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>AND there came his mother and his brethren, standing without; and they sent to call him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>But the congregation sat about him. And they say to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without inquire for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered, and said to them, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking upon those who sat with him, he said, Behold my mother, and behold my brethren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>for whosoever shall do the will of Aloha, he is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And he began again to teach by the sea-side: and great assemblies were gathered to him; so that, ascending, he sat in a bark on the sea, and the whole multitude stood on the land, by the edge of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he instructed them by many parables, and said in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Listen: Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>and as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and the fowl came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And other fell upon the rock, so that it had not much earth; and it soon came up, because it had not depth of earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>but when the sun arose, it became hot; and inasmuch as it had no root, it dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And other fell in a place of thorns; and the thorns sprang up, and choked it, and it gave no fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But other fell upon good ground; and it came up, and grew, and gave fruits, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, Whoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, they who were with him along with his twelve inquired of him that parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And Jeshu said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of Aloha; but to those without every thing is in parables:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that while seeing they may see, and not see; and while hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said to them, Do you not know this parable? how will you know all parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower who sowed, the word sowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>These which were by the way-side, these are they in whom the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately cometh Satana, and taketh up the word which was sowed in their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these who upon the rock are sowed, these are they who, when they have heard the word, at once with joy receive it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>but they have no root in themselves, but are (only) for a time; and when there is affliction or persecution on account of the word, they are soon offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these who in the place of thorns are sown, these are they who hear the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the care of this world, and the deceptiveness of wealth, and the remainder of other lusts, entering, choke the word, and it is without fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these who in good ground are sowed, these are they who hear the word, and receive, and give fruits, thirty, and sixty, and a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, A lamp never cometh to be put under a measure, or under a bed: is it not set upon a candlestick?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For nothing is hid which shall not be revealed; nor is there any thing in secret which is not to be manifested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>AND he said to them, Consider what you hear. With that measure which you mete, you shall have measured to you; and there shall be, added to you those which you hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whosoever hath, unto him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as a man who shall cast seed into the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and shall sleep, and rise up by night and day, and the seed shall increase, and become long, while he knoweth not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth yieldeth him fruit; and first is there the plant, and after it the ear, but lastly the completed corn in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is mature, immediately cometh the sickle, because the harvest is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, To what may we compare the kingdom of Aloha? and with what comparison shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard, which, when sown in the earth, is smaller than all seeds which are in the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>and when it is sown, it springeth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and maketh great branches; so that in its shadow the fowl can dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>In parables such as these spake Jeshu with them, in parables such as they could hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>And without parable did he not speak with them: but to his disciples, between him and them, he explained all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>AND he said to them that day, in the evening, Let us pass to the opposite shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And they sent away the assembles, and took him into the vessel; and other vessels were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there was a great commotion and wind, and the waves fell upon the vessel, which was nigh being filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But Jeshu upon a pillow slept in the after-part of the vessel, and they came and raised him, saying to him, Raban, hast thou no care that we are perishing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he arose, and restrained the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be silent. And the wind ceased, and there was a great stillness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said to them, Why feared ye? how is it ye have no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared with great fear, and said among themselves, Who is this, to whom the winds and the sea are obedient?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>AND they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadroyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he had come from the vessel, there met him from the place of tombs a man who had an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>and he dwelt in the place of tombs; and with chains no man could bind him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>for, so often as with shackles and chains he had been bound, the chains he had broken, and the shackles he had burst asunder; and no man could subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And at all time, by night and by day, he was in the place of tombs, and in the mountains, crying out, and bruising himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But when he saw Jeshu from afar, he ran, worshipped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and cried with a high voice, and said, What to me and to thee, Jeshu, Son of Aloha the Most High? I adjure thee by Aloha, that thou torment me not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he had said to him, Come forth from the man, unclean spirit!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he questioned him, How is thy name? And he said to him, Legion is our name, because we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he besought him much that he would not send him out of the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now at the mountain there was a great herd of swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And the devils besought him, saying, Send us into those swine, that into them we may enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And he suffered them. And those unclean spirits went forth and entered into the swine; and that herd ran to the rock, and plunged into the sea, as two thousand, and were drowned in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And they who kept them fled, and told in the city, and also in the hamlets; and they came forth to see what was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they came to Jeshu, and saw him who (had had) the devils, sitting, clothed, and sane; him, who had had in him the legion and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And they who had seen, related to them what had been done to him who had had the devils, and also concerning those swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to beg of him to go from their coast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And when he had ascended the vessel, he in whom had been the devils besought him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But he permitted him not; but said to him, Go to thy house, to thy men, and show them what the Lord hath done for thee, and (how he) hath had mercy on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went, and began to preach in the ten cities what Jeshu had done for him: and all marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>AND when Jeshu had passed in the vessel to the opposite side, there were again congregated unto him great gatherings, while he was upon the shore of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And there came one whose name was Jorosh, one of the masters of the synagogue; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and besought him much, saying to him, My daughter is greatly afflicted; come, lay thy hand upon her, and she will be healed, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And Jeshu went with him; and a great multitude adhered to him, and oppressed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>But a certain woman, who had a defluxion of blood twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>who much had suffered from many physicians, and had expended all whatever she had, and was nothing helped, but also the more afflicted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>having heard of Jeshu, came in the press of the crowd behind him, and touched his vestment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, If I but touch his vestment, I shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried; and she felt in her body that she had been healed from her plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>But Jeshu at once knew within himself that power had gone forth from him, and he turned to the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>His disciples say to him, Thou seest the crowds that oppress thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked round to see who this had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman herself, fearing and trembling, because she knew what had been done for her, came, fell before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>But he said to her, My daughter, thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace, and be healed from thy plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>And while he was speaking, there came some of the house of the master of the synagogue, saying, Thy daughter is dead: for what then art thou wearying the Teacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jeshu heard the word which they spake, and said to the master of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he did not permit any one to go with him, except Shemun Kipha, and Jacub, and Juchanon, brother of Jacub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And they came to the house of that master of the synagogue, and he saw how they made a tumult, and wept and bewailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And he entered, and said to them, Why make you a tumult, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they derided him. But Jeshu put them all forth, and took the father of the damsel, and her mother, and those who were with her, and went in where the damsel was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And he took the hand of the damsel, and said to her, Damsel, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And forthwith the damsel arose, and walked; for she was a daughter of twelve years. And they wondered with great admiration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he charged them greatly that no one should know this, and spake that they should give her (somewhat) to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>AND Jeshu went forth from thence, and came to his city; and his disciples adhered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when it was shabath, he began to teach in the house of the congregation: and many who heard wondered, and said, Whence to him are these? and what is this wisdom which hath been given him, that miracles such as these by his hands should be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mariam, and the brother of Jacub, and of Josi, and of Jehuda, and of Shemun? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>And Jeshu said to them, No prophet is despised, unless in his own city, and among his kinsfolk, and in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he could not do there any miracle, except that upon a few sick he laid his hands, and healed them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he wondered at the defectiveness of their faith. AND he itinerated through the villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he called his twelve, and began to send them two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits to cast them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>And he instructed them to take nothing for the journey, except a staff only; not a wallet, nor bread, nor brass in their purses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but be shod with sandals, and not to be clothed with two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, Into whatsoever house you enter, there be until you go forth from thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And every one who will not receive you, nor hear you, when you are going out from thence, beat off the dust that is beneath your feet for their testimony. And Amen I say to you, That it shall be more tolerable for Sadum and for Amura in the day of the judgment, than for that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And they went forth, and preached that they should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And many devils they cast out, and anointed with oil the sick, and healed many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>AND Herodes the king heard concerning Jeshu, for his name had become known; and he said, Juchanon the Baptizer hath risen from among the dead; therefore works of power are wrought by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others said, He is Elia; and others, A prophet as one from the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herodes heard, he said, It is Juchanon whom I beheaded; he hath risen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herodes had sent and had taken Juchanon, and had cast him into the house of the bound, on account of Herodia, wife of Philipos his brother, whom he had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For Juchanon had said to Herodes, It is not lawful to thee to take the wife of thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>But Herodia herself was adverse to him, and wished to kill him, but she could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>For Herodes feared Juchanon, because he knew that he was a man righteous and holy, and he protected him, and was many (times) hearing him, doing, and hearing him favourably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And there was a notable day when Herodes, in the house of his nativity, (b'beth yaldeh,) made a feast to his chiefs and kiliarchs and the heads of Galila;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>and the daughter of Herodia came in (and) danced; and she pleased Herodes and them who reclined with him. And the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he sware to her, Whatever thou shalt ask (of) me, I will give thee, unto the dividing of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>Then went she out and said to her mother, What shall I ask of him? She saith to her, The head of Juchanon the Baptizer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>And immediately she entered with solicitude unto the king, and saith to him, I will this hour that thou give me, upon a dish, the head of Juchanon the Baptizer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And greatly grieved was the king; but, for the sake of the oath, and the sake of the guests, he could not deprive her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>But the king despatched at once a sentinel, and commanded that he should bring the head of Juchanon. And he went and cut off the head of Juchanon in the house of the bound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought (it) in a dish and gave to the damsel, and the damsel herself gave to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>And his disciples heard and went, took up his corpse, and laid it in the place of the buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>AND the disciples gathered unto Jeshu, and told him all whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And he said to them, Come and let us go into the desert alone, and rest a little while; for there were multitudes going and coming, (so that) they had not space even to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>and they went to a wilderness district in a vessel by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>And many saw them as they went, and knew them; and into the waste ran they from all the cities, and were there before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>And Jeshu coming forth beheld the great assemblies, and had compassion upon them, they being like sheep which had no shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And when much time had passed, the disciples came to him and said to him, This place is waste, and the time is great;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>send them away to go to the farms around us and into the villages, and buy for themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But he said to them, Give you them to eat. They said to him, Shall we go and buy bread for two hundred dinoreen, and give them to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>But he said, Go see how many loaves you have here; and when they had seen, they said to him, Five loaves and two fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>And he directed that they should make them all recline in companies upon the herbage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>and they reclined in companies, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the bread, and gave to his disciples to set before them: and those two fishes they divided among them all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>and they all did eat and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and from the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Now they who had eaten bread were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he constrained his disciples to ascend into the bark, and to go before him across to Beth-tsaida, while he dismissed the assemblies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>and when he had sent them away, he went to a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>BUT when it was eventide, the bark was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone upon the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And he saw them that they were distressed with rowing; for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night Jeshu came to them walking upon the waters, (as though) he willed to pass by them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>but they beheld him walking upon the waters, and thought it was a spectre, and they cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for all saw him and were afraid. But he immediately spoke to them and said to them, Take heart, I am, fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he ascended to them into the ship, and the wind was still: and they wondered greatly, and were astonished among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they understood not from that bread, because their heart was gross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Genesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they had gone forth from the bark, the men of the place at once recognised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>And they ran throughout all that land, and began to bring those who were greatly afflicted, bearing them on couchettes, to where they heard that he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever he entered, into villages and cities, they placed the sick in the streets, and besought from him that they might touch only the edge of his mantle; and all they who touched him were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>AND there gathered to him Pharishee and Sophree, who had come from Urishlem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>and they saw some of his disciples eating bread with their hands not washed; and they complained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For all the Jihudoyee and Pharishee, unless they carefully wash their hands, do not eat, because they hold the tradition of the elders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>and (coming) from the market, unless they lave, they eat not. And many other of those (things) there are which they have received to observe, (as) the baptisms of cups, and of measures, and of brasen utensils, and of beds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>And the Sophree and Pharishee questioned him, Why do not your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders; but, while their hands are not washed, eat bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>But he said to them, Well prophesied concerning you Eshaia the prophet, you hypocrites; as it is written, This people with their lips honour me, but their heart is very far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>But in vain do they reverence me while they teach the teachings of the commandments of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>For you have abandoned the commandment of God and hold the tradition of men, as the baptisms of cups and measures, and many things like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>He said to them (moreover), You decently suppress the commandment of God, that you may establish your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Musha hath said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and whosoever curseth father and mother, the death he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, If a man shall say to his father, or to his mother, My oblation, (be that) whatever from me thou mayest profit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>and you permit him not to do any thing for his father and his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>But you reject the word of Aloha for the sake of the tradition which you have delivered: and many similar (observances) to these you practise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And Jeshu called the whole multitude, and said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>It is not that which is without the man, and which entereth into him, that can defile him: but that which proceedeth from him, that defileth a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>He who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>But when Jeshu had gone into the house (apart) from the multitude, his disciples asked him concerning that parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>He said to them, How dull are even you! Know you not, that nothing from without that entereth a man can defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it entereth not into his heart, but into his belly, and is cast out in the purgation which all food purgeth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>But that which proceedeth from a man, that polluteth a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, from the heart of the sons of men, go forth evil thoughts, adultery, fornication, robbery, murder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>rapacity, malice, fraud, obscenity, an evil eye, blasphemy, vain-glory, folly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>all these evils come from within, and they defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>FROM thence Jeshu arose and went to the confine of Tsur and of Tsaidon, and entered into a certain house: and he was unwilling that any man should know of him, but he could not conceal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>For immediately heard a certain woman concerning him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit; and she came, (and) fell before his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>But that woman was a Gentile of Phuniki of Suria, and she prayed of him to cast out the demon from her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But Jeshu said to her, Let the children first be filled; for it is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>But she answering said to him, Yes, my Lord, yet the dogs also from beneath the table eat the crumbs of the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>Jeshu saith to her, Go; on account of that word, the demon hath gone forth from thy daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>And she went to her house, and found her daughter lying on the couch, and the demon had gone out from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Jeshu again departed from the confine of Tsur and of Tsaidon, and came to the sea of Galila, on the confine of the Ten Cities;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>and they brought to him a blind man, a stammerer, and besought him to lay upon him the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And he took him aside from the crowd by himself, and put his fingers in his ears, and spat, and touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>And he looked up to heaven, and sighed, and said to him, Be opened:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>and in that hour his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And he charged them that to no man they should tell this. But so much as he charged them, they the more proclaimed it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>and they were exceedingly astonished, and said, He doeth every thing well; the deaf he maketh to hear, and them who spoke not, to speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>BUT in those days when the multitude was great and there was nothing for them to eat, he called his disciples, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>I have compassion on this multitude, for behold three days have they continued with me, and there is nothing which they may eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if it be that I send them away fasting to their houses, they will faint in the way; for some of them come from afar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>His disciples say to him, Whence can any one here in the wilderness satisfy with bread all these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he asked them, How many loaves have you? They say to him, Seven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>and he directed the multitudes to recline upon the ground, and he took those seven loaves, and blessed and brake and gave to his disciples that they should set, and they set before the assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And there were fishes, a few: and also over them he blessed, and said that they should set them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>And they all ate and were satisfied, and took up the abundancies of the fragments, seven panniers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Now the men who had eaten were about four thousand: and he dismissed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>and immediately ascended into a vessel with his disciples, and came to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>AND there came forth Pharishee, and began to question with him, and they demanded of him the sign from heaven, tempting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And he groaned in his spirit, and said, Why seeketh this generation the sign? Amen I say to you, There shall not be given the sign unto this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And he left them, and ascended into the ship, and went to that overland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>And they had forgotten to take with them bread, and but one cake was with them in the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And he counselled them, and said to them, Look and beware of the leaven of the Pharishee, and of the leaven of Herodes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they reasoned one with another, saying, Because we have no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>But Jeshu knew, and said to them, Why reason you because you have no bread? do you not yet know nor under stand? is your heart still hard?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>and eyes have you, and not see? and ears have you, and not hear? neither remember you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When those five loaves I brake to five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up? They said to him, Twelve.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>He saith to them, How do you not yet understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>And he came to Beth-tsaida; and they brought to him a blind man, and prayed of him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>And he took the hand of the blind man, and led him forth without from the village; and spat in his eyes, and laid (on them) his hand, and inquired whether he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>And he looked, and said, I see the sons of man as the trees, walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Again he laid his hand upon his eyes, and he was restored, and he saw every thing clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And he sent him to his house, and told him to go not into the village, nor to inform any man in the village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jeshu went forth and his disciples into the villages of Kesarea of Philipos, and he interrogated his disciples by the way, saying to them, What say men concerning me that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>But they answered, That (thou art) Juchanon the Baptizer; and others, that (thou art) Elia; and others, one from the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>Jeshu said to them, But you, what say you concerning me that I am? Shemun Kipha answered and said to him, Thus art the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha the Living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>And he charged them that to any one they should not tell concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And he began to teach them, that it was to be that the Son of man should suffer much, and be rejected by the elders, and by the chief priests, and by the Sophree, and be killed, and that the third day he should arise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>And he spake the word with them fully. And Kipha took him, and began to chide him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But he turned, and, beholding his disciples, reprehended Shemun, and said, Get thee behind me, Satana, for thou thinkest not that which is of Aloha, but that which is of the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>AND Jeshu called to the assemblies with his disciples, and said to them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For every one who willeth to save his life shall lose it; and every one who shall lose his life on account of me and on account of my gospel, shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>For what is a man profited, if the whole world he gain, and his soul be lost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>Or what shall a son of man give (as) the compensation for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this generation, sinful and adulterous, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>AND he said to them, Amen I say to you, There are some who are standing here, who shall not taste death, until they shall have seen the kingdom of Aloha come with power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>And after six days Jeshu took Kipha, and Jacub, and Juchanon, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves. And he was altered before their eyes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>and his raiment shone, and became exceeding white as the snow; as the sons of man on earth could not make white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And there were seen with them Musha and Elia discoursing with Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>And Kipha said to him, Rabi, it is good for us here to be: and let us make three tabernacles; for thee one, and for Musha one, and for Elia one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>But he knew not what he said, for they were in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And there was the cloud, and it shadowed over them: and the voice was from the cloud, saying, This is my Son, the Beloved, him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And instantly, while the disciples looked, they saw no man, but Jeshu alone with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And while they were descending from the mountain, he charged them to tell no man what they had seen, until the Son of man should have arisen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And they held discourse among themselves, and inquired what was this word, when he should have arisen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they asked him, saying, How then say the Sophree that Elia must come before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>He said to them, Elia doth come before, to restore all things; and how it is written concerning the Son of man, that much he should suffer, and be rejected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>But I tell you, Elia hath also come, and they have done to him whatever they would, as it is written concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>AND when he came to his disciples, he saw with them a great crowd, and the Sophree questioning with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>And immediately all the crowd saw him, and wondered, and ran to salute him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he inquired of the Sophree, What dispute you with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>And one from the company answered and said, Malphona, I had brought my son to thee, because he hath a spirit which speaketh not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>and when he seizeth him, he dasheth him, and teareth and grindeth his teeth, and he becometh dry. And I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out, but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>Jeshu answered, and said to him, O generation that believeth not! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I tolerate you? bring him to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>And they brought him unto him: and when the spirit saw him, he immediately dashed him, and he fell upon the ground; and was convulsed, and was torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>And Jeshu asked the father, How long is it from the time from which it was thus? He saith to him, Behold, from his childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And many times he casteth him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but whatever thou canst, help me, and have mercy upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jeshu saith to him, If thou canst believe, every thing can be to him who believeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>And in a moment the father of the youth cried out, weeping and saying, I am believing; help the defect of my faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>But when Jeshu saw the people running together, and assembling to him, he rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to him, Spirit, deaf and unspeaking! I command thee, come forth from him, and enter not into him again!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>And that devil cried greatly, and crushed him, and went forth. And he became as the dead; as that many would say, He is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jeshu took him by the hand, and raised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>But when Jeshu had gone into the house, his disciples inquired of him by themselves, Why could not we cast him out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>Jeshu said to them, This kind with nothing can be cast out, but by fasting and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>And when he had gone forth from thence, they passed into Galila: and he was not willing that any man should know of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>And he taught his disciples, and told them, That the Son of man would be delivered into the hands of men, and they would kill him; and that when he was slain, on the third day he should arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they understood not his word, and feared to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>AND they came to Kapher-nachum: and when they had entered the house, he asked them of what they had argued in the way among themselves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>And Jeshu sat, and he called the twelve, and said to them, Whoever wills to be the first, shall be the last of all, and the servant of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And he took a certain child, and made him stand in the midst: and he took him upon his arms, and said to them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>And if thy foot offend thee, cut it off: better for thee to go into life lame, than having two feet to fall into gihana:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>And if thine eye offend thee, root it out: better for thee that with one eye thou enter the kingdom of Aloha, than having two eyes to fall into the gihana of fire:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And he sent to the husbandmen his servant in the time to receive the fruits of the vinery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>But they beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>shall we give, or shall we not give? But he knew their deceit, and said to them, Why do you tempt me? bring me the dinara, (that) I may see it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>Seven brethren there were. The first took a wife, and died, and left not seed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection therefore, whose from them shall she be the wife? for the seven of them had her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jeshu saith to them, Do you not on this account err, because you know not the scripture, nor the power of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they rise from the dead, they take not wives, neither are wives (given) unto husbands; but as the angels that are in heaven are they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>But concerning the dead, that they rise: have you not read in the book of Musha, how from the bush Aloha said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Ishok, and the God of Jacub?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>AND one from the Sophree approached and heard how they disputed, and, perceiving that he had well rendered to them the answer, inquired of him, Which is the first commandment of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jeshu saith to him, The first of all the commandments (is), Hear, Israel, The Lord our Aloha is one Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>And the second, which is like it, (is) that thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Another commandment greater than these there is not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>That Sophra said to him, Well, Rabi, and truly hast thou spoken: for One there is and no other than He:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and that a man love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and that he love his neighbour as himself, is better than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Jeshu, seeing that he had wisely returned the word, answered and said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of Aloha. And no man dared again to question him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And Jeshu answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the Sophree that the Meshicha is son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself saith by the Spirit of Holiness, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I set thy adversaries a footstool beneath thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>David therefore himself calleth him My Lord; and how is he then his son? And all the multitude heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And in his doctrine he said to them, Beware of the Sophree, who will to walk in long robes, and love the shaloma in public places,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>AND as Jeshu sat before the house of treasure, he beheld how the multitude cast money into the place of treasure; and many rich threw in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And there came a certain poor widow, and threw in two menin, which are a shemona.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And Jeshu called to his disciples, and said to them, Amen I tell you, That this poor widow more than all the men who throw hath thrown into the house of treasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For all they from what is (super)abundant to them have thrown (in), but this from her deficiency all whatever she had; she hath thrown in her whole possession.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>We heard him say, I dissolve this temple which is made with hands, and in three days I build another not made with hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>But neither so was their testimony equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>And the chief of the priests arose in the midst, and questioned Jeshu, and said, Returnest thou no answer? what witness against thee these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But Jeshu was silent, and answered him nothing. And again the chief of the priests demanded, and said, Art thou the Meshicha, the Son of the Blessed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And he, Jeshu, said to him, I am: and you shall see the Son of man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming upon the clouds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the chief of the priests tore his robe, and said, Why now seek we witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>Behold, from his own lips you have heard the blasphemy: how is it seen by you? And they all judged that he was guilty of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on his person, and they struck him on his face, and did buffet him, saying, Prophesy! and the servitors struck him upon his cheeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And Shemun being below in the court, there came a certain damsel of the chief of the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>She saw him as he warmed (himself), and knew him, saying to him, Thou also wast with Jeshu Natsroia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, and said, I know not what thou sayest. And he went without into the vestibule; and the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And again that damsel saw him, and she began to say to those who were standing, This man is also of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But he again denied. And after a little while those who stood said to Kipha, Assuredly thou art from them, for thou art also a Galiloia, and thy speech is similar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to imprecate and to swear, I know not this man of whom thou speakest. And in the hour the cock crew the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And Shemun remembered the word that Jeshu had spoken to him, That before the cock should crow twice, three times thou shalt deny me. And he began to weep.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>AND forthwith in the morning the chief priests with the elders and with the scribes and with the whole congregation made council; and they bound Jeshu, and led him and delivered him to Pilatos the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilatos asked him, Art thou the King of the Jihudoyee? And he replied and said to him, Thou hast said.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But he, Jeshu, did not give any answer; so that Pilatos admired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>But he was accustomed at every festival to release to them of the bound one whom they requested;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>and there was one who was called Bar-aba, who was bound with the makers of sedition, they who murder in the sedition had committed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For Pilatos knew that for envy the chief priests had delivered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests the more incited the multitude, that Bar-aba he should release to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>But he, Pilatos, said to them, What then will you that I do to this, whom ye call King of the Jihudoyee?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>But Pilatos was willing to serve the will of the people, and released to them Bar-aba, and delivered up to them Jeshu, scourged, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him into the court which is the praetorium, and called the whole band;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>and they robed him in purple, and twisted and set upon him a crown of thorns,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jihudoyee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>and they struck him upon the head with a cane, and spat in his face, and kneeled upon their knees and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple, and clothed him with his own vestments, and led him forth to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>AND they constrained one who was passing, Shemun Kurinoia, who was coming from the field, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought him to Gogultha, a place which is interpreted A skull.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>and was accomplished the Scripture which said, That with the wicked he was reckoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>AND they also who passed by blasphemed against him, wagging their heads and saying, Ho, undoer of the temple and builder of it in three days,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>But he, Jeshu, cried with a high voice, and completed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>But when that centurion who stood near him saw that he cried thus, and ended, (he) said, Assuredly this man was the Son of Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And Jauseph bought linen, and took him down and wrapped him in it, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn in the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the sepulchre.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>BECAUSE many have willed to record histories of those transactions of which we are persuaded, according to that which they have delivered to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>(they) who from the first were eye-witnesses and ministers of his doctrine;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it appeared also to me, that having been intimately near to them all, I should record every thing in its order for thee, illustrious Theophile,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>that thou mayest know the truth of those doctrines in which thou hast been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>THERE was in the days of Herodes, king of the Jihudoyee, a certain priest whose name was Zakaria, of the service of the house of Abia, and his wife (was) of the daughters of Aharun; her name was Elishaba.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both just before Aloha, and walked in all his commandments, and in the righteousness of the Lord, without blame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no son because Elishaba was barren, and both had become many in their days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>But it was while he was acting-as-priest in the order of his ministry before Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood he came to set on incense, and entered into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And all the congregation of the people were praying without at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him, to Zakaria, the angel of the Lord, standing on the right hand of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zakaria trembled when he saw him, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>And the angel said to him, Fear not, Zakaria, for thy prayer is heard, and thy wife Elishaba shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And to thee shall be joy and exultation, and many shall rejoice in his birth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>for he shall be great before the Lord, and wine and strong liquor shall he not drink, and with the Spirit of Holiness shall he be filled, from the womb of his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the sons of Isroel shall he convert to the Lord their Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit and the power of Elia the prophet, to turn the hearts of the fathers unto the children, and those who believe not to the knowledge of the righteous, and to prepare for the Lord a perfect people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zakaria said to the angel, How shall I know this? for I am old, and my wife many in her days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered and said to him, I am Gabriel, I stand before Aloha, and I have been sent to speak with thee and to announce to thee these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>From henceforth thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be able to speak, till the day when these things shall be done, because thou hast not believed these words, which shall be fulfilled in their time.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But when Zakaria had come forth, he could not speak to them; and he made them understand that he had seen a vision in the temple, and signing he signed to them, and remained dumb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And it was after those days Elishaba his wife conceived, and she secluded herself five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>And she said, These things hath the Lord done for me in the days of my desolation, to take away my reproach from among the children of men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>NOW it was in those days that there went forth a mandate from Augustus Caesar to enrol the people of his dominion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This enrolment was first made under the government of Qurinos in Suria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And every man went to be enrolled in his city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Jauseph also went up from Natsrath of Galila, unto Jehud, to the city of David, which is called Beth-lechem, because he was of the house and of the family of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>with Mariam his espoused while with child, there to be enrolled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it was that while they were there, the days were fulfilled that she should give birth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>and she brought forth her son, the first-born, and wrapped him in bandages, and laid him in the manger; because there was no place for them where they stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>But there were shepherds in the country who were staying there, and keeping watch by night over their flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And, behold, the angel of Aloha came to them, and the glory of the Lord shone upon them; and they feared with great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Fear not; for, behold, I announce to you great joy, which shall be to all people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>for there is born for you to-day the Redeemer, who is the Lord the Meshicha, in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this is to you the sign, You shall find the infant wrapped in bandages, and laid in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And instantly there were seen with the angel many hosts of the heavens, glorifying Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>and saying, Glory to Aloha in the heights, and upon earth peace and good hope for the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And when the angels were gone from them into heaven, the shepherds spake one with another, and said, Let us go unto Beth-lechem, and see the thing which the Lord hath made known to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with speed, and found Mariam, and Jauseph, and the infant who was laid in the manger;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>and when they saw, they showed the word which had been spoken to them concerning the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard wondered at those (things) which were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mariam kept all these words, and compared them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And those shepherds returned, glorifying and praising Aloha for all that they had seen and heard as they had been spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>AND when the eight days completed to circumcise the child, his name was called Jeshu, for he was so called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when were completed, the days of their purification according to the law of Musha, they carried him up to Urishlem, to present him before the Lord:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer the sacrifice as it is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtle-doves, or two of the young of pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>But there was a certain man in Urishlem, whose name was Shemun; and this man was just and righteous, and he had waited for the consolation of Isroel, and the Spirit of Holiness was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it was said to him from the Spirit of Holiness, that he should not see death, until he had seen the Meshicha of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>Behold, this man came in the Spirit to the temple, and when his parents brought in Jeshu the child, to do for him as it is commanded in the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took him upon his arms and blessed Aloha, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Now dismiss thy servant, my Lord, according to thy word, in peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For lo, mine eyes have seen thy grace,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light for the revelation of the peoples, And the glory of thy people Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>But Jauseph and his mother wondered at these words which were spoken concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Shemun blessed them, and said to Mariam his mother, Behold, this child is set for the ruin and uprising of many in Isroel, for the sign of contention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>And through thine own soul shall pass a spear, that may be revealed the reasonings of the hearts of many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>NOW Chana, the prophetess, (was) the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher; she was aged also in her days, and seven years with her husband had lived from her virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>And she was a widow as of years eighty and four, and she removed not from the temple, and with fasting and with prayer she worshipped in the day and in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And she also arose in that hour and confessed the Lord, and discoursed concerning him with all who were expecting the redemption of Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had fulfilled every thing according to the law of the Lord, they returned unto Galila, to Natsrath their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>But the child grew, and was strengthened in spirit, and was filled with wisdom; and the grace of Aloha was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his relatives every year went unto Urishlem at the feast of Petscha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>AND when he was a son of twelve years, they went up, as they were used, to the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when the days (were) fulfilled, they returned. But Jeshu, the child, remained in Urishlem, and Jauseph and his mother knew not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>For they thought that he was with the sons of the company; and when they had gone the journey of one day, they sought him with the men and with any who knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And they found him not: and they returned again to Urishlem, and sought him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, hearing them and questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all of them were astonished, as they heard him, at his wisdom and at his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him, they wondered; and his mother said to him, My son, why hast thou done with us thus? for, behold, I and thy father with great anxiety have sought thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He saith to them, Why have you sought me (elsewhere)? Knew you not that (in) the house of my Father it behoveth me to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not comprehend the word that he spake to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Natsrath, and was subject to them. But his mother kept all these words in her heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the high priesthood of Chanan and of Kaiopha, was the word of Aloha unto Juchanon bar Zakaria in the desert.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they signed to their companions, who were in another vessel, to come and help them. And when they had come, they filled those two vessels, so that they were nigh to be swallowed up.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they found not how to bring him in because of the multitude of people, they ascended to the house-top, and sent him with his couch from the roof into the midst before Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And when Jeshu saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Man, forgiven to thee are thy sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the Sophree and Pharishee began to reason and to say, Who is this who speaketh blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but Aloha only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But Jeshu knew their reasoning, and said to them, What reason you in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier, to say, Forgiven to thee are thy sins; or to say, Arise, walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But that you may know that authority hath the Son of man in the earth to forgive sins,-he saith to the paralytic,-To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thine house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And immediately he arose before them, and took up his couch, and went to his house, glorifying Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And amazement held every man; and they glorified Aloha, and were filled with fear, saying, We have seen today wonders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After these things Jeshu went forth, and saw a tribute-taker, whose name was Levi, sitting at the house of tribute. And he said to him, Come after me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>and he left every thing, and arose, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi made in his house a great feast; and there was a large company of tribute-takers, and of others that reclined with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Sophree and Pharishee murmured, saying to his disciples, Why with tribute-takers and sinners eat you and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jeshu answered and said to them, The whole do not require the physician, but they who are grievously ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I am not come to call the just, but the sinners, to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>But they say to him, Why do the disciples of Juchanon constantly fast, and pray also as the Pharishee, but thine eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>But he said to them, How can you make the sons of the chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken up from them: then shall they fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He spake to them a parable: No man cutteth a piece from a new material, and fasteneth it upon an old garment; lest he rend the new, without completing the old with the piece that is new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no man poureth new wine into old bottles; lest the new wine burst forth, and the wine be shed, and the bottles perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But they pour new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no man, drinking old wine, immediately asketh new: for he saith, The old is softer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>But when he saw Jeshu, he cried out, and fell before him, and said in a high voice, What to us and to thee, Jeshu, son of Aloha Marima? I beseech of thee, torment me not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For Jeshu commanded the unclean spirit to come forth from the man. For long was the time that he had been enthralled of him; and (when) bound with chains, and kept with fetters, he had burst asunder his bonds, and had been driven by the demon into the waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>And Jeshu demanded of him, What is thy name? He saith to him, Legion: because that many devils had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they besought from him that he would not cast them out to go into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was there a great herd of many swine which fed on the hill: and they besought from him that he would permit them to enter into the swine. And he permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>And the demons went forth from the man, and entered into the swine; and the whole herd went directly to the precipice, and plunged into the waters, and were suffocated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And when the herdmen saw the thing that was done, they fled, and made known in the city and in the villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>And the men went forth to see the thing which was done. And they came to Jeshu, and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, clothed, sober, and sitting at the feet of Jeshu. And they feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And they who had seen it showed to them how the man of the demon had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And the whole multitude of the Godroyee besought of Jeshu that he would go from them, because great fear had taken them. And he, Jeshu, ascended the ship, and returned from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>But he, the man from whom had gone forth the demons, besought of him that he might be with him. But Jeshu dismissed him, and said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>Return to thine house, and show what Aloha hath done for thee. And he went and proclaimed in every city what Jeshu had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>WHEN Jeshu returned, a great multitude received him: for they were all expecting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And a certain man whose name was Jorush, head of the synagogue, fell before the feet of Jeshu, and besought him to enter into his house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter, as a daughter of twelve years, and she was nigh unto death. And as Jeshu went with him, the great multitude pressed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a certain woman whose blood had gushed forth twelve years, she who among the physicians had spent all her substance, but could not be healed by any one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>approached him from behind, and touched the border of his garment, and immediately stood the flowing of her blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jeshu said, Who touched me? And when all denied, Shemun Kipha and those with him said, Raban, the crowd straiteneth and presseth thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But he said, Some one hath touched me, for I know that power hath gone forth from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And she, the woman, when she saw that she was not hid, came trembling and fell (and) worshipped him. And she told before all the people for what cause she had touched him, and how at once she had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>But he, Jeshu, said to her, Be comforted, my daughter: thy faith hath saved thee, go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>And while he was speaking, there came a man from the chief of the synagogue and said to him, Thy daughter is dead, weary not the Malphona.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But Jeshu heard, and said to the father of the damsel, Fear not, only believe, and she lives!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>But Jeshu came to the house, and he suffered no man to enter with him, save Shemun, and Jakub, and Juchanon, and the father of the damsel, and her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And they were all weeping and wailing for her; but Jeshu said, Weep not, for she is not dead, but asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they laughed at him, for they knew that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he put every man forth without. And he took her by the hand, and called and said, Damsel, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she arose. And he directed that they should give her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were astonished; but he cautioned them that no man they should tell what he had done.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>AND Jeshu called his twelve, and gave them power and authority over all demons and diseases, to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>And he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of Aloha, and to heal the diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them, Take nothing for the way, neither staff, nor bag, nor bread, nor silver; nor two tunics shall you have.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>And the apostles went forth and itinerated in the villages and the cities, and evangelized and healed in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>But Herodes, Tetrarka, heard all that was done by his hand, and was astonished; for men said that Juchanon had risen from the house of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>But others said that Elia had appeared, and others that a prophet from the former prophets had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herodes said, The head of Juchanon I have cut off; but who is this of whom I hear these (things)? And he willed to see him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But the multitudes, when they knew it, went after him, and he received them, and discoursed to them concerning the kingdom of Aloha. And those who had need of healing he healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>BUT when the day began to decline, the disciples drew near and said to him, Send away the multitudes, that they may go to the villages and hamlets that are around, to lodge in them and to find for themselves victuals, because we are in a desert place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>Jeshu said to them, Give you them to eat. But they said, We have nothing more than five loaves and two fishes, unless we go and buy food for all this people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>for they were about five thousand men. Jeshu said to them, Make them recline in reclining companies, fifty men in a company.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And the disciples did so. And they all reclined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>And Jeshu took those five loaves and two fishes, and looked up to heaven and blessed and brake and gave to his disciples, that they should set before the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>And all did eat and were filled. And they took up fragments which abounded, twelve baskets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>AND as he was praying alone, and his disciples with him, he asked them and said, What say concerning me the multitude, that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>They answered and say to him, Juchanon the Baptizer; and others that (thou art) Elia; but others that a prophet from the former prophets hath arisen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>And he told them how it was to be (that) he the Son of man should suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and Sophree, and (that) they would kill him; and that on the third day he would arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And he said before all, Whoever willeth to come after me, must deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and come after me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>And it was after these words about eight days, that Jeshu took Shemun and Jakub and Juchanon, and went up into a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And while he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was changed, and his garments became white and shone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And, behold, two men talked with him, who were Musha and Elia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in glory; but they spake concerning his going forth which should be accomplished at Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>And Shemun, and they who were with him, had been heavy with sleep, and were scarcely awaked when they saw his glory and those two men who stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And when they began to depart from him, Shemun said to Jeshu, Rabi, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; for thee one, and for Musha one, and for Elia one. But he knew not what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>And as he spoke these (words) there was a cloud which shadowed over them, and they feared when they saw that Musha and Elia entered into the cloud.i</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And the voice was from the cloud, saying, This is my Son, the Beloved, Him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And when the voice had been, Jeshu was found alone. And they were silent, and told no man in those days what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>AND the day after when they had descended from the mountain, a great multitude met them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And a certain man from the multitude cried and said, Malphona, I beseech thee, turn unto me; (there is) my son, my only one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>and a spirit passeth upon him, and he suddenly crieth, and gnasheth his teeth, and lacerateth, and hardly removeth from him when he hath bruised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I besought thy disciples to cast him out, but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Then Jeshu answered and said, Ah generation unbelieving and perverse! how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring thy son hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as they brought him near, the devil cast him down and bruised him: and Jeshu rebuked that unclean spirit and healed the youth and gave him to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they all wondered at the majesty of Aloha. And while every one wondered at all which Jeshu did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Treasure these words in your ears; for the Son of man is to be delivered into the hands of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they understood not that saying, because it was hidden from them that they should not know it: and they feared to ask of him concerning that saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>And there entered among them the thought, Who should be greatest among them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jeshu knew the thought of their heart; and he took a child and made him stand with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>And he said to them, Every one who receiveth a child like this in my name, receiveth me. And whosoever receiveth me, he receiveth Him who sent me. For he who is least among you, he shall be greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And Juchanon answered and said, Raban, we saw a man who was casting out demons in thy name, and we forbade him, because he came not with us after thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>Jeshu saith to them, Forbid him not; for he who is not against us, he is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>AND it was that when the days were fulfilled for his Assumption, he directed his face to go to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>And he sent messengers before his face, and they went and entered into a village of the Shomroyee, so as to prepare for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>And they would not receive him, because his face unto Urishlem was set to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when Jacub and Juchanon his disciples saw it, they say to him, Maran, art thou willing that we call fire to descend from heaven to consume them, as Elia did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned and reproved them, and said, You know not of what spirit you are: for the Son of man is not come to destroy lives, but to save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And while they went in the way, a certain man said to him, I will follow thee to the place whither thou goest, my Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jeshu saith to him, The foxes have holes and the fowls of the heaven a shadow, but the Son of man hath not where to lay his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said to another, Come after me. But he said to him, My Lord, permit me first to go bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jeshu said to him, Leave the dead burying their dead; and thou, go and preach the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another said to him, I will come after thee, my Lord, but first permit me to go to salute the sons of my house, and I will come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>Jeshu saith to him, No man putting his hand upon the coulter of the yoke, and looking behind him, is fit for the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.10'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>AFTER these Jeshu separated from his disciples seventy others, and sent them by two and two before his face to every place and city whither he was himself to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>And he said to them, The harvest is great, but the labourers (are) few; pray therefore from the Lord of the harvest to send forth labourers into his harvest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>They who heard said to him, And who can be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>But Jeshu said, Those (things) which with the sons of men are not possible, with Aloha are possible to be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>Shemun Kipha said to him, Behold, we have forsaken every thing, and have come after thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>Jeshu saith to him, Amen I say to you, That no man who leaveth houses, or fathers, or brethren, or wife, or children, for the kingdom of Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>and shall not receive by two-fold (as) many in this time, and in the world that cometh the life that is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>AND Jeshu took the twelve, and said to them, Behold, we go up to Urishlem, and shall be fulfilled all (things) that are written in the prophets concerning the Son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For he will be delivered to the Gentiles; and they will deride him, and spit in his face,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>and will scourge him, and maltreat him, and kill him; and the third day he shall arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>But not one of these understood they: for this word was hidden from them, and they knew not those sayings which were spoken with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>And as he drew nigh to Jirichu, a certain blind man was sitting by the road-side, and begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>And he heard the voice of the multitude as it was passing, and asked what was this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>They say to him, Jeshu Natsroya passeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>And he cried and said, Jeshu bar David, have mercy on me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>And they who went before Jeshu rebuked him, that he might be silent: but he cried out the more, Son of David, have mercy on me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>And Jeshu stood, and commanded that they should lead him unto him. And when he, approached him, he asked him and said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>What wilt thou I shall do for thee? And he said, My Lord, that I may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>And Jeshu said to him, See! thy faith hath saved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>And in an instant he saw, and came after him, and glorified Aloha: and all the people, when they saw, gave praise to Aloha.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>And as Jeshu entered and passed through Jirichu,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>there was a certain man whose name was Zakai; he was rich and chief of the publicans:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>and he wished to see Jeshu, who he was, and could not for the crowd, because in his stature Zakai was small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>And he ran before Jeshu, and ascended a wild fig-tree to see him, because so he was about to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when Jeshu came to that place, he saw him, and said to him, Be in haste, descend, Zakai; for to-day I must be at thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>And he was in haste, and descended, and received him rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>But when they all saw (this), they murmured, and said that with a man a sinner he hath gone in to abide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>But Zakai stood, and said to Jeshu, Behold, my Lord, the dividing of my wealth give I to the poor; and to every man, whatever I have wrongfully taken, fourfold I restore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>Jeshu saith to him, To-day is there salvation to this house, because this (man) also (is a) son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>For the Son of man came to save that which was lost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>And when they had heard these things, he added to speak a parable; because he had drawn nigh to Urishlem, and they expected that in that hour would be revealed the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>And he said, A certain man of a noble house went into a distant country, to receive for himself a kingdom, and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>And he called his ten servants, and gave to them ten minin, and said to them, Trade till I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>But his citizens hated him, and sent messengers after him, saying, We are not willing that this should reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>And having received the kingdom and returned, he spake to call to him those servants to whom he had given the silver, that he might know how every one of them had traded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>And the first came and said, My lord, thy mani ten minin hath gained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>He saith to him, Well, good servant: because in a little thou art found faithful, thou shalt have rule over ten towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second came and said, My lord, thy mani five minin hath made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>He saith also to this, Thou also shalt have rule over five towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>And the other came and said, My lord, behold thy mani which I have had with me, laid up in a napkin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>For I feared thee, because thou art a hard man, taking up what thou hadst not laid down, and reaping what thou sowedst not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>He said to him, From thy own mouth I will judge thee, evil servant: thou didst know that I was a hard man, taking up what I had not laid down, and reaping what I sowed not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>why (then) gavest thou not my silver upon the table, that when I came I might require it with its increase?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>And to those who stood before him he said, Take from him the mani, and give to him who hath the ten minin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>They say to him, Our lord, he hath ten minin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>He saith to them, I tell you, that to every one who hath (it) shall be given; and from him who hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>But those adversaries who would not that I should reign over them, bring them, and slay them before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>AND when Jeshu had said these things, he went forward to go to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>And when he came to Bethphage and Beth-ania, at the mount that is called the Place of Olives, he sent two from his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>and said to them, Go to the village over against us; and as you enter, behold, you will find a colt tied, whereon no man hath ridden: loose and bring him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>And if any man demand why you loose him, thus say: It is requested by our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>And they who were sent went and found as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>And as they were loosing the colt, the owners of him said to them, Why loose you the colt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>And they said to them, Because by our Lord it is requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>And they brought him to Jeshu; and they cast upon the colt their garments, and Jeshu rode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as they went, they spread their clothes in the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>And when he had come nigh to the declivity of the Mount of Olives, the whole assembly of the disciples began to rejoice, and praise Aloha with a high voice, for all the mighty acts which they had seen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>and they said, Blessed be the King who cometh in the name of the Lord! Peace in the heavens, and glory in the highest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>But some of the Pharishee from among the multitudes say to him, Rabi, rebuke thy disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>He saith to them, I tell you, if these should be silent, the stones would cry out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>AND when he approached, and saw the city, he wept over her, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>If thou hadst known these things which are for thy peace, and in this thy day! But now they are hidden from thine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>But the days will come to thee when thine enemies shall encompass thee and straiten thee on every side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>and they shall overthrow thee, and thy children within thee, and not leave in thee one stone upon another, because thou knewest not the time of thy visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>And as he went into the temple, he began to cast out those who bought in it and sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>and said to them, It is written that my house is the house of prayer; but you have made it a den of thieves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And he taught every day in the temple; but the chief priests and the scribes and the elders of the people sought to destroy him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>but could not find what they might do to him; for all the people hung upon him to hear him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>AND it was on one of the days, while he taught the people in the temple and evangelized, the chief priests and scribes with the elders rose up against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and said to him, Tell us by what authority thou doest these, and who is he who gave thee this authority?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>Jeshu answered and said to them, I will also ask of you a word, and tell you me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>the baptism of Juchanon, from heaven was it, or from the sons of men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>But they reasoned within themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven, he saith to us, Why did you not believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we shall say, From men, all the people will stone us; for they are persuaded that Juchanon was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they said to him, We know not from whence it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>Jeshu saith to them, Nor tell I you by what authority I do these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to speak to the people this parable: A certain man planted a vinery, and let it to husbandmen, and removed for a great time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the season he sent his servant to the husbandmen that they should give him of the fruit of the vinery. But the husbandmen beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And he added and sent another servant; but they beat him also, and maltreated him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And he added and sent a third; but they also wounded him, and cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>The lord of the vinery saith, What shall I do? I will send my son, the beloved; now will they see him and reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the husbandmen saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And they cast him out of the vinery, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vinery do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those husbandmen, and will give the vinery to others. But when they heard, they said, May this not be!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But he beheld them, and said, And what is that which is written, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>And every one who shall fall upon this stone shall be broken; and every one on whom it shall fall it will scatter him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>But the chief priests and Sophree sought to lay hands on him in that very hour; but they feared the people, for they knew that concerning them(selves) he had spoken this parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they sent to him spies, who should resemble just men, that they might take him in discourse, and deliver him to the judgment and to the authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, and said to him, Doctor, we know that thou speakest and teachest rightly, neither dost thou deceive, but with integrity thou teachest the way of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to give head-silver to Cesar or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he understood their subtilty, and said, Why tempt you me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>Jeshu saith to them, Give then of Cesar's to Cesar, and of Aloha's unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they could not take hold of his words before the people; and they wondered at his answer, and were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>BUT some of the Zadukoyee approached, they who say that there is no resurrection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>and they questioned him, and said to him, Doctor, Musha wrote to us that if a man's brother die having a wife who hath not children, his brother shall take his wife, and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>But there were seven brethren; and the first took; a wife, and died without children.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Died in the end also the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>In the resurrection therefore, whose of them shall she be the wife? for the seven of them had taken her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>Jeshu saith to them, The sons of this world take wives, and women become (the wives) of men:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but they who of that world are worthy, and of the resurrection which is from among the dead, take not wives, neither do women become (the wives) of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>Neither again can they die, for they are as the angels; and the children are they of Aloha, because they have become the children of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead arise, Musha also showeth; for he commemorateth at the bush, while he saith, The Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Ishok, and the God of Jakub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>But he was not the God of the dead, but of the living: for they all live unto him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>And they dared not question him again of any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>AND he said to them, How say the Sophree concerning the Meshicha, that he is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>until I put thine adversaries beneath thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>If David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And while all the people heard, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the Sophree, who will to walk in stoles, and love the shaloma in public places, and the chief seats in the synagogues, and the chief reclining-places at evening feasts;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>Jeshu looked at those rich (persons) who were throwing into the house of treasure their oblations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He saith to them, When, you have entered into the city, a man meeteth you, bearing a pitcher of waters; go after him, and when he hath gone in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>say to the lord of the house, Our Master saith, Is there a dining-place where I may eat the petscha with my disciples?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>And he will show you a certain large upper chamber which is furnished: there make ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>And they went, and found as he had told them: and they prepared the petscha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>And when it was time, Jeshu came and reclined, and the twelve apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>And he said to them, With desire have I desired to eat this petscha with you before I suffer:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>for I tell you that from henceforth I shall not eat it, until it shall have been fulfilled in the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>And he took the cup, and praised, and said, Take this, and divide it among yourselves:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>for I tell you that I shall not drink of the fruit of the vine, until the kingdom of Aloha shall have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>And he took bread, and praised, and brake, and gave to them, and said, This is my body which for you is given: this do in my memory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>And thus also respecting the cup, when, after they had supped, he said, This cup is the new covenant in my blood, which for you is shed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>Nevertheless, the hand of him who betrayeth me is on the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>And the Son of man goeth, as he was set apart: nevertheless woe to that man by whom he is betrayed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>And they began to inquire among themselves, who it was of them who this should do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>But there was also a contention among them, who of them was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>And Jeshu said to them, The kings of the Gentiles are their lords; and they who exercise authority over them, doers of good are called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But you, not so: yea, he who is great among you, let him be as the least; and he who is chief, as one who serveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For who is greatest, he who reclineth, or he who serveth? Is not he who reclineth? But I am among you as he who serveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You are they who have remained with me in my temptations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I promise to you, as hath promised to me my Father, a kingdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>that you may eat and drink at the table in my kingdom, and may sit upon thrones, and judge the twelve tribes of Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>AND Jeshu said to Shemun, Shemun, behold, Satana, demandeth to sift thee as wheat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith may not fail: and thou also, in the time that thou art converted, confirm thy brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>But Shemun said to him, My Lord, with thee I am prepared, and for the house of the bound, and for death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Jeshu saith to him, I tell thee, Shemun, that the cock will not crow to-day, till three times thou hast denied that thou knowest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>And he said to them, When I sent you without purse, or scrip, or shoes, was any thing wanting to you? They say to him, Nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>He saith to them, Henceforth, he who hath a purse, let him take it, and likewise a scrip also; and he who hath not a sword, let him sell his garment and buy a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>For I tell you also, that what is written must be fulfilled in me, that with the transgressors he was numbered: for all which concerns me must be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>And they say to him, Our Lord, behold, here are two swords. He saith to them, They suffice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>And he came forth, and went, as he was used, to the mount of the Place of Olives; and his disciples also went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>And when come unto the spot, he said to them, Pray that you enter not into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And he removed from them as (about the distance of) a stone's throw, and bowed the knee, and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>and said, Father, if thou wilt, let this cup pass: nevertheless not my will, but thine be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>And an angel appeared to him from heaven, who strengthened him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in terror, more vehemently he prayed, and his sweat was as drops of blood, and fell upon the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>And he arose from prayer, and came to his disciples, and found them asleep, from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>And he said to them, Why sleep you? arise and pray, that you enter not into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>And as he was speaking, behold a multitude, and behold him who was called Jihuda, one of the twelve, coming before them, and he came nigh to Jeshu, and kissed him: for this was the sign he had given to them, He whom I shall kiss is he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>Jeshu saith to him, Jihuda, with the kiss betrayest thou the Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>But when they who were with him saw what was done, they say to him, Our Lord, shall we strike with the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And one of them struck the servant of the high priest, and took off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>Jeshu answered and said, It sufficeth until this; and he touched his ear which he had struck, and healed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>And Jeshu said to them who had come against him, the chief priests, and elders, and the chiefs of the forces of the temple, As against a thief are you come forth against me, with swords and clubs to take me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>Every day with you have I been in the temple, and you did not stretch forth upon me (your) hands; but this is your hour and the power of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>And they took (and) brought him to the house of the chief of the priests; and Shemun came after him from afar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>Now they had kindled a fire in the midst of the hall, and were sitting around it, and Shemun also sat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>And a certain damsel saw him as he sat by the fire, and, looking at him, she said, This also was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied, and said, Woman, I know him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And after a little while, another saw him, and said, Thou also art of them. But Kipha said, I am not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>And after one hour another contended and said, Assuredly this also was with him, for he is also a Galiloya.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>Kipha saith, Man, I know not what thou sayest. And at once, while he was speaking, the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And Jeshu turned, and looked upon Kipha; and Shemun remembered his word which our Lord had spoken to him, that before the cock shall crow thou wilt have denied me three times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And Shemun went without and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>And the men who held Jeshu mocked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>and veiled him, and they struck him upon the face, saying, Prophesy, who struck thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And many other things they blasphemed and spake against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>AND when it dawned, the elders and chief priests and the Sophree came together, and took him into the house of their assembly; saying to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>Art thou the Meshicha? tell us. He saith to them, Should I tell you, you would not believe me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>and were I to ask you, you would not return me a word, nor release me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>Henceforth the Son of man sitteth at the right hand of the power of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>Then said they all, Thou art, then, the Son of Aloha? Jeshu saith to them, You say that I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>They say, Why yet need we witnesses? for we have heard from his mouth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>And the whole assembly of them arose, and brought him to Pilatos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse him, saying, We have found this who deludeth our people, and forbiddeth that tribute unto Caesar we should give, saying of himself that he is the King Meshicha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>But Pilatos asked him, and said to him, Art thou the king of the Jihudoyee? He saith to him, Thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>And Pilatos said to the chief priests and to the assembly, I find no occasion against this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they cried out and said, He commoveth our people while he teacheth throughout all Jihud, beginning from Galila unto this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>Pilatos, however, when he heard the name of Galila, asked if the man were a Galiloya.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And when he knew that he was from the limit of the jurisdiction of Herodes, he sent him unto Herodes, because that in Urishlem he was in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>And Herodes, when he saw Jeshu, was very glad; for he had desired to see him of a great time: for he had heard concerning him many things, and hoped that some sign he should see from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>And many words he asked him; but Jeshu gave him no answer whatever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and scribes stood and strenuously accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then Herodes and his soldiers treated him as a fool; and when he had derided him, he dressed him in a robe of crimson, and sent him to Pilatos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And in that day Pilatos and Herodes were friends with each other; for before there had been enmity between them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilatos called the chief priests and the rulers of the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, You have brought to me this man as a perverter of your people; and, behold, I have examined him in your sight, and have found no cause in this man of all that you accuse him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>nor also Herodes; for I sent him unto him, and, behold, nothing worthy of death is done to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him, and dismiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>For a custom had he to release to them one at the festival.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But all the multitude cried out, saying, Take this, and release to us Baraba;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>he who, for insurrection and murder which had been done in the city, had been thrown into the house of the chained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>But Pilatos spake with them again, being willing to release Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried out, saying, Crucify him! Crucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>He the third time also said to them, Why, what evil hath this done? Cause whatever that is worthy of death, I find not in him: I will therefore chastise him, and dismiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were urgent with a high voice, demanding that they might crucify him; and theirs and the voices of the high priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilatos commanded that their requirement should be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released to them him who, for insurrection and murder, had been thrown into the house of the chained, whom they had asked: but Jeshu he delivered to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>AND as they led him away, they laid hold on Shemun Kurinoya, who was coming from the country, and they laid on him the cross, that he might bear (it) after Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there followed him much people, and those women who mourned and wailed for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>And Jeshu turned to them, and said, Daughters of Urishlem, weep not for me, but for yourselves weep, and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For, behold, coming are the days in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs which have not borne, and the breasts that have not suckled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us! and to the heights, Cover us!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if to the tree which is good they do these things, unto the dry what shall be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And there went with him two others, workers of evil, to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to a certain place called Karkaphtha, there they crucified him, and those workers of evil, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>BUT Jeshu himself said, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they divided his garments, and cast for them lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>But the people stood beholding, and the rulers also, mocking him, and saying, He saved others, let him save himself, if he be the Meshicha, the Chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also, deriding him, approaching him, and offering to him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>said to him, If thou art the King of the Jihudoyee, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also an inscription which was written over him in Greek and Roman and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JIHUDOYEE.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of those workers of evil who were hanged with him, blasphemed against him, saying, If thou art the Meshicha, deliver thyself, and deliver us also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>And his companion rebuked him, and said to him, Dost thou not fear (even) Aloha? for thou also art in this judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we righteously, forasmuch as we have been deserving, and as we are punished for that which we have done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>but this hath done nothing that is abominable. And he said to Jeshu, Remember me, my Lord, when thou art come into thy kingdom!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>Jeshu saith to him, Amen I say to thee, That to-day with me thou shalt be in Paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>NOW it was about six hours, and there was darkness over all the earth until nine hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun darkened, and rent was the vail of the temple through the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jeshu cried with a high voice, and said, My Father, in thy hands I place my spirit. This he said, and completed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>this approached Pilatos, and begged the body of Jeshu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>and he took it down, and wrapped it in a cloth of linen, and laid it in a hewn sepulchre, in which no one had hitherto been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And it was the day of the preparation; and the shabath had lighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women also drew near, they who had come with him from Galila; and they saw the sepulchre, and where the body was laid;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>But on the first (day) in the week, in the morning, while yet dark, they came to the sepulchre, and brought those aromatics which they had prepared;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>and entered, but found not the body of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it was that while they were amazed at this, behold, two men stood over against them, and whose raiment shined;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>and they were in fear, and bowed their faces to the earth. And they said to them, Why are you seeking the living with the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, he is risen. Remember what he spake with you while he was in Galila,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and returned from the sepulchre, and told all these (things) unto the eleven, and to the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now it was Mariam Magdalitha, Juchanon, and Mariam his mother, and Jacub, and the rest who were with them, who told these (occurrences) to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And these words appeared in their eyes as dreams, and they believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Shemun arose, and ran to the sepulchre, and, looking in, he saw the linen clothes lying apart; and he went away, wondering in himself at what was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>AND, behold, two of them in that day went to a village whose name was Emaos, and distant from Urishlem sixty stadia.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What are these words that you speak with each other, as you walk and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them answered, whose name was Kleopha, and said to him, Art thou only a stranger from Urishlem, who knowest not what hath been done in it in these days?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they also declared those things which had happened in the way, and how he was made known to them while he brake the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>AND while they were discoursing, Jeshu stood among them, and said to them, Peace be with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>I am; fear not. And they were troubled, and were in fear; for they thought they beheld a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>Jeshu saith to them, Why are you perturbed, and why arise thoughts in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I: feel me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see that I have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And while these words he spake, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they as yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have you here somewhat to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave to him a portion of broiled fish, and of the comb of honey;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took (and) did eat before their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, These are the words that I spoke with you while I was with you, that every thing must be fulfilled which is written in the law of Musha, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then opened he their minds, that they might understand the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And he said to them, that so it is written, and so it was just, that the Meshicha should suffer, and should rise from among the dead in the three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that in his name should be preached repentance and the forgiveness of sins among all nations, and that the commencement should be from Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And you are the witnesses of these. And I will send upon you the promise of my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>But await you in Urishlem the city until you be clothed with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he brought them out unto Bethania, and lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it was that while he blessed them, he was separated from them, and he ascended to the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshipped him, and returned to Urishlem with great joy. And at all time were they in the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>praising and blessing Aloha. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word himself was with Aloha, and Aloha was the Word himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>This was in the beginning with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>Every thing by his hand was made; and without him also was not one thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life is the light of the sons of man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>and the Light himself in the darkness shineth, and the darkness perceived him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man who was sent from Aloha, his name (was) Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came for the testimony, to testify concerning the Light, that all men might believe through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the Light himself, but came to testify concerning the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>For that was the true Light that enlighteneth every man who cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>In the world was he, and the world by his hand had been made, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But they who received him, he gave to them power, that the sons of Aloha they should become, to those who believe in his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>These, not from blood, nor from the will of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from Aloha, are born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word flesh was made, and tabernacled with us; and we saw his glory, the glory as of the one-begotten who (was) from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>Juchanon testified concerning him, and cried, and said, This is he of whom I said, that he cometh after me, and was before me, because he is anterior to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And from his fulness we all have received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law by the hand of Musha was given; but the truth and the grace were by Jeshu Meshicha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>ALOHA no man hath ever seen: the one-begotten God, he who is in the bosom of his Father, he hath declared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this was the testimony of Juchanon, when the Jihudoyee sent to him from Urishlem priests and Levoyee to demand of him, Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed, and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Meshicha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him again, What then? art thou Elia? And he said, I am not. Art thou the Prophet? And he said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>And they said to him, And who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He saith, I am the voice which crieth in the wilderness, Make plain the way of the Lord, as said Eshaia the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>But they who were sent were from the Pharishee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they demanded and said to him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Meshicha, nor Elia, nor the Prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>Juchanon answered and said to them, I baptize you with waters; but he standeth among you whom you know not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>he it is who cometh after me, and he was before me; he, the latchets of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethania, at the passage of the Jurdan, where Juchanon was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>AND the day after, Juchanon seeth Jeshu, who was coming to him; and he said, Behold the Lamb of Aloha, who beareth the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he concerning whom I said, After me cometh a man, and he was before me, because he is anterior to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not, but that he should be made known unto Isroel, therefore have I come with waters to baptize.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And Juchanon testified and said, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven as a dove, and it remained upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not: but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me, He upon whom thou seest the Spirit descend and remain, this baptizeth with the Spirit of Holiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>and I saw, and bare witness that this is the Son of Aloha</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>And the day after Juchanon stood, and two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and, contemplating Jeshu as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of Aloha!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And his two disciples heard him as he spake, and they went after Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jeshu turned (himself), and saw them coming after him, and said to them, Whom seek you? They say to him, Raban, where dwellest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith to them, Come and see. And they went and saw where he dwelt; and they were with him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Now one of those who heard Juchanon and went after Jeshu, was Andreas, the brother of Shemun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>This saw first Shemun his brother, and said to him, We have found the Meshicha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>and he brought him to Jeshu. And Jeshu saw him, and said, Thou art Shemun bar Jona; thou shalt be called Kipha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>AND the day following Jeshu willed to go forth into Galila. And he found Philipos, and said to him, Come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philipos was from Beth-tsaida, from the city of Andreas and of Shemun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philipos found Nathanael, and said to him, Him of whom Musha in the law, and the prophets, did write we have found, (and) that Jeshu (is) he, the son of Jauseph who is from Natsrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Saith to him Nathanael, From Natsrath can any good thing be? Philipos saith to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>And Jeshu saw Nathanael as he was coming to him, and said of him, Behold truly a son of Isroel who hath no guile in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jeshu saith to him, While yet Philipos had not called thee, while thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabi, thou art the Son of Aloha himself, thou art the very King of Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jeshu saith to him, Upon my telling thee that I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Greater things than these thou shalt see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>He saith to him, Amen, amen, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of Aloha ascending and descending unto the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>AND on the third day there was a feast in Kotna, a city of Galila; and the mother of Jeshu was there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and Jeshu and his disciples were called to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And the wine failed, and his mother saith to him, to Jeshu, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jeshu saith to her, What (is it) to me and to thee, woman? Not yet hath come mine hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother saith to the servitors, Whatever he telleth you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six waterpots of stone set there, unto the purification of the Jihudoyee, which contained each two quarantals or three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jeshu saith to them, Fill these water-pots with waters; and they filled them to the top.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>He saith to them, Draw now, and carry to the chief of the guests. And they carried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And when that chief of the guests had tasted those waters which were made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servitors knew, who had filled them with waters,) the chief of the guests called the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, Every man at first the good wine produceth, and when they are satisfied, then that which is inferior; but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This is the first sign that Jeshu wrought in Kotna of Galila, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>AFTER this he went to Kapher-nachum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples. And they were there a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the petscha of the Jihudoyee was nigh, and Jeshu went up to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And he made him a scourge of cord, and drove them all from the temple, and the sheep and the oxen and the money-changers; and he shed their money, and their tables he overturned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And to those who sold doves he said, Take these hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath devoured me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jihudoyee answered and said to him, What sign showest thou to us, as these things thou doest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jeshu answered, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jihudoyee say to him, Forty-and six years was this temple being built, and wilt thou in three days raise it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spake of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>But when he was risen from the house of the dead, his disciples remembered that this he had said; and they believed the scriptures, and the word which Jeshu had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>WHILE Jeshu was in Jerusalem at the petscha, at the feast, Many believed in him who saw the signs which he wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But he, Jeshu, did not confide himself to them, because he knew every man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and needed not that any should testify to him concerning any man, because he knew what is in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>But there was one of the Pharishee whose name was Nikodimos, a ruler of the Jihudoyee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>this came to Jeshu in the night, and said to him, Rabi, we know that from Aloha thou art sent a teacher; for no man can these signs perform which thou doest, unless Aloha be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jeshu answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nikodimos said to him, How can an old man be born? Who can again the womb of his mother the second time enter, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jeshu answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, That if a man be not born of waters and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>Whatever is born of the flesh, is flesh; and whatever is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Wonder not that I have said to thee, that it behoves you to be born anew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind bloweth where she willeth, and her voice thou hearest; but thou knowest not whence she cometh, nor whither she goeth: so is every man who is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nikodimos answered and said to him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jeshu answered and said to him, Art thou Malphona of Israel, and these knowest not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Amen, amen, I say to thee, What we know we speak, and what we have seen we testify; but our testimony you receive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If of (what is) on earth I tell you, and you believe not, how if I tell you of (what is) in heaven, could you believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>AND no man hath ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man, he who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Musha elevated the serpent in the wilderness, so is to be elevated the Son of man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that every man who believeth in him might not perish, but have the life which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For so loved Aloha the world, as his Son, the Only-begotten, he would give, that every one who believeth in him might not perish, but have the life which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For Aloha sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might live by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believeth on him is not judged, and he who believeth not is judged already, because he believeth not in the name of the only-begotten Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment, that the light hath come into the world, and the sons of men have loved darkness rather than the light, for their deeds have been evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one who doeth abominable things hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be known that in Aloha they are wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>AFTER these came Jeshu and his disciples into the land of Jihuda, and there conversed with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>But Juchanon also was baptizing in Ein-yon, near Sholim, because the waters were there many; and they came and were baptized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>for not yet was Juchanon cast into the house of the bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>But there was a question with some of the disciples of Juchanon (and) a certain Jihudoya, upon purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to Juchanon, and said to him, Raban, he who was with thee at the passage of Jurdan, (and) concerning whom thou didst give witness, he also baptizeth, and many come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>Juchanon answered and said to them, A man cannot receive of his own will any thing, unless it be given to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You bear me witness that I said, I am not the Meshicha, but I am an apostle before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and attendeth him, with great joy rejoiceth on account of the voice of the bridegroom: this my joy therefore, behold, is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>To him it must be to increase, and to me to decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>For he who from above hath come, is above all; and he who is from the earth, is of the earth, and of the earth speaketh: he who from heaven hath come, is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what he hath seen and heard he testifieth, and his testimony no man receiveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>But he who hath received his testimony, hath sealed that the true Aloha is he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom Aloha hath sent, the very words of Aloha speaketh; for it was not in measure that Aloha gave the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loveth the Son, and every thing hath he given into his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believeth in the Son hath the life which is eternal; and he who obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of Aloha remaineth on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>But when Jeshu knew that the Pharishee had heard that he had made many disciples, and baptized more than Juchanon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though it was not Jeshu himself baptized, but his disciples,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Jihuda, and came again into Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>AND he needed that in going he should pass through among the Shomroyee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>and he came to a city of the Shomroyee which is called Shokar, nigh to the field which Jakub gave unto Jauseph his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>And the fountain of water of Jakub was there. But Jeshu was wearied with the labour of the way, and sat by the fountain; and it was six hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There came a woman from Shomreen to draw waters, and Jeshu said to her, Give me waters to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>Now his disciples had gone into the city to buy for them meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The woman, the Shomroytha, saith to him, How (canst) thou who art a Jihudoya ask drink of me who am a woman, a Shomroytha? For the Jihudoyee have no accommodation with the Shomroyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jeshu answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of Aloha, and who He is who hath said to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he had given thee living waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>That woman saith to him, My Lord, thou hast no vessel, and the well is deep; whence hast thou living waters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art thou greater than our father Jakub, he who gave us this well, and himself drank of it, and his children, and his flocks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jeshu answered and said to her, Every one who shall drink of these waters again will thirst;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but every one who shall drink of the waters that I will give him shall never thirst; but those waters that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of waters, that shall spring forth to the life of eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>That woman saith to him, My Lord, give me of those waters, that I thirst not again, nor come to draw from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jeshu saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>She saith to him, I have no husband. Jeshu saith to her, Well hast thou said, I have no husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for five husbands hast thou had, and this whom thou now hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>That woman saith to him, My Lord, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers in this mountain worshipped, and you say that in Urishlem is the place where it behoves to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jeshu saith to her, Woman, believe me that the hour cometh when neither in this mountain, nor at Urishlem, you shall worship the Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>you worship something you know not; but we worship whom we know; for salvation is from the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father also requireth worshippers such as these.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And as he spoke, his disciples came, and they wondered that with the woman he spoke; but no man said, What inquirest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, I have food to eat of which you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>The disciples say among themselves, Has any man brought him somewhat to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jeshu saith to them, My meat is to do the will of Him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Say you not, that after four moons cometh harvest? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes, and see the lands which have become white for the harvest already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he who reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; and the sower and the reaper shall rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this is the proverb true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that (for) which you did not toil; for others toiled, and you have entered upon their labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Now of that city many Shomroyee believed in him, because of the saying of that woman, who testified, He told me every thing that I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>And when those Shomroyee came to him, they besought him to be with them. And he was with them two days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>and many believed through his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And they said to the woman, Now not through thy word believe we in him; for we have heard and known that this is truly the Meshicha, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>AND after two days Jeshu went forth from thence, and came into Galila;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>for he himself testified, that a prophet in his own city is not honoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>But when he came to Galila, the Galiloyee received him, because they had seen all the signs which he had done in Urishlem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So Jeshu came again into Kotna of Galila, where he had made the waters wine. And there was at Kapher-nachum the servant of a certain king, whose son was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>This (man) heard that Jeshu had come from Jihuda into Galila; and he came to him, and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was near to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jeshu saith to him, If signs and wonders you do not SEE, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The servant of the king saith to him, My lord, come down ere my child die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jeshu saith to him, Go, thy son liveth. And the man believed in the word which Jeshu had spoken to him, and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>But as he was going down, his servants met him, and gave him good news, saying to him, Thy son liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>And he asked at what time he was healed. They say to him, Yesterday, at seven hours, the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>And his father knew that in that hour it was in which Jeshu said to him, Thy son liveth; and he believed, and all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This is again the second sign (which) Jeshu did when he had come from Jihuda into Galila.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>AFTER these there was a feast of the Jihudoyee, and Jeshu went up to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there was there in Urishlem a certain place of ablution, which was called in Hebrew Bethchesda, and having in it five porticoes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>And in these were many infirm people, blind and lame and withered, awaiting the moving of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel at times descended to the pool and moved the waters; and he who first descended after the movement of the waters was healed of whatever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>But a certain man was there who for thirtyand-eight years had been in a disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jeshu saw this (man) as he lay, and knew that for a long time he had (been thus), and said to him, Art thou willing to be healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The diseased man answered and said, Yes, my Lord; but I have no man who, when the waters are moved, shall cast me into the pool: but while I am coming, another before me descendeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jeshu saith to him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And in the instant that man was healed, and, arising, he took up his bed, and walked: and that day was the shabath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>And the Jihudoyee said to him who had been healed, This is the shabath: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered and said to them, He who made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>And they said to him, What man is this who told thee to take up thy bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he who had been healed knew not who it was; for Jeshu had retired among the great multitude which was in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After a time Jeshu found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art healed: sin not again, lest there be to thee that which is worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>And that man went away, and told the Jihudoyee, that it was Jeshu who had healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>On account of this the Jihudoyee persecuted Jeshu, and sought to kill him, because these things he had done on the shabath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But he, Jeshu, said to them, My Father until now worketh, I also work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>But on this account the more sought the Jihudoyee to kill him, not only because he had loosed the shabath, but also that of Aloha he had said that he was his Father, and had made himself equal with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>BUT Jeshu answered and said to them, Amen, amen, I say to you, The Son cannot do any thing from the will of himself, but that which he seeth the Father do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For those which the Father doeth, these also the Son likewise doeth. For the Father loveth the Son, and every thing that he doeth he showeth him; and greater than these works he showeth him, that you may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth, so also the Son quickeneth those whom he willeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judgeth no man, but all judgment he hath given to the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Amen, amen, I say to you, He who heareth my word and believeth on him who sent me, hath the life that is eternal, and into condemnation he cometh not, but hath passed from death unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Amen, amen, I say to you, That the hour cometh and also now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of Aloha; and they who hear shall live</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father hath life in his person, so hath he given also to the Son to have life in his person,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and hath empowered him also to execute judgment. Because he is the Son of man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>marvel not at this; for the hour cometh when all they who are in the sepulchres shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall come forth; they who have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they who have done evil unto the resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I CANNOT of the will of myself do any thing; but as I hear I judge, and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I should witness concerning myself, my testimony would not be (regarded as) truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>there is another who witnesseth of me, and I know that true is his testimony which he hath witnessed of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You sent to Juchanon, and he witnessed of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I do not from man (only) receive testimony. But these (things) speak I that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a lamp that burneth and shineth, and you were willing to glory for the hour in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a testimony which is greater than that of Juchanon; for the works that the Father hath given me to accomplish, these works that I do testify of me that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who hath sent me, he testifieth of me: but his voice you have never heard, nor his appearance seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And his word abideth not in you, because in Him whom he hath sent you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Investigate the scriptures; for in them you think you have the life that is eternal, and they testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And you will not come to me that the life that is eternal you might have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>Glory from the sons of men I receive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that the love of Aloha is not in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in the name of my Father, and you have not received me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>If another should come in his own name, him you would receive. How can you believe, who glory one from another are receiving, and the glory which is from one, Aloha, you seek not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>How think you that I will accuse you before the Father? There is one who accuseth you, Musha himself, in whom you hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if in Musha you had believed, you would also have believed in me; for Musha of me hath written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if his writings you believe not, how my words will you believe?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>AFTER these Jeshu went over the Sea of Galila of Tiberios,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>and great multitudes went after him, because they had seen the signs which he wrought on the diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jeshu ascended a mountain, and there sat with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the feast of the petscha of the Jihudoyee drew nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>And Jeshu lifted up his eyes, and saw the great assembly which had come to him; and he said to Philipos, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But this he said trying him; for he knew what he was about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philipos saith to him, Two hundred dinoreen of bread is not sufficient for them, that a little every one of them may take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>Saith to him one of his disciples, Andreas, brother of Shemun Kipha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is here a certain youth, who hath with him five cakes of barley and two fishes; but these what are they for these all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jeshu saith to them, Make all the men recline; for there was much herbage in that place. And the men reclined, in number five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jeshu took the bread, and blessed, and divided unto those who reclined, and likewise also of the fishes, as much as they willed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that abound, that nothing be lost;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>and they gathered and filled twelve baskets of fragments, those which abounded unto them who had eaten of the five loaves of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>But those men, when they had seen the sign which Jeshu had wrought, said, Truly this is the Prophet that cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>But when Jeshu knew that they were about to come to seize him and make him the King, he passed away to a mountain alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>AND when it was eventide, his disciples went down to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>And they sat in a vessel, and went over for Kapher-nachum. And it was dark, and Jeshu had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>But the sea had risen against them, because a great wind blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>And they had led stadia twentyfive or thirty, and they saw Jeshu walking upon the sea, and drawing nigh to the vessel; and they feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But Jeshu himself said to them, I am, fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>And they willed to receive him into the vessel, and soon that vessel was at that land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The day after the people that stood on the opposite shore of the sea saw that there was not another vessel there except that into which the disciples had ascended, and that Jeshu had not entered with his disciples into the vessel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>but there came other boats from Tiberios near the place, where they did eat bread when Jeshu had blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>And when that company saw that Jeshu was not there nor his disciples, they ascended into those boats, and came to Kapher-nachum. And they sought Jeshu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>and when they had found him on the opposite side of the sea, they say to him, Raban, when camest thou hither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jeshu answered and said to them, Amen, amen, I tell you, You seek me, not because you considered the signs, but because you did eat the bread, and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Work not (for) the food which perisheth, but (for) the food that endureth unto the life that is eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you: for this hath the Father sealed, (even) Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They say to him, What shall we do that we may work the works of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jeshu answered and said to them, This is the work of Aloha, that you believe in Him whom he hath sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>THEY say to him, What sign doest thou that we may see, and believe in thee? What performest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers manna did eat in the desert, as it is written, that bread from heaven be gave them to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jeshu saith to them, Amen, amen, I tell you, That Musha gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven:</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>It was that Mariam who anointed with balsam the feet of Jeshu, and wiped (them) with her hair, whose brother this Loozar was who was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>And his two sisters sent unto Jeshu, saying, Our Lord, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>But Jeshu said, This sickness is not of death, but for the glory of Aloha, that the Son of Aloha may be glorified on account of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>But Jeshu loved Martha and Mariam and Loozar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>And when he heard that he was sick, he remained in the place where he was two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>And afterwards he saith to his disciples, Come, we will go again into Jihud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>His disciples say to him, Raban, now have the Jihudoyee sought to stone thee; and again goest thou thither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jeshu saith to them, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>but if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because no light is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These spake Jeshu; and afterwards he said to them, Loozar our friend reposeth; but I go to awake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>His disciples say to him, Our Lord, if he sleep he is healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jeshu spake concerning his death; and they thought that concerning the repose of sleep he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then said Jeshu to them explicatively, Loozar is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad I was not there for your sakes, that you may believe. But let us walk thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Thoma, who is called the Twin, saith to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said these, she went, called Mariam her sister in secret, and said to her, Our Master hath come, and calleth for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>When Mariam heard, she arose quickly, and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>But Jeshu himself had not yet come into the village, but was in that place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>But those Jihudoyee who were also with her in the house to console her, when they saw that Mariam rose up hastily to go forth, went themselves after her; for they thought that to the sepulchre she went to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>But she, Mariam, when she was come where Jeshu was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying, If thou hadst been here, my Lord, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>But Jeshu, when he saw her weeping, and those Jihudoyee who came with her weeping, he was moved in his spirit, and was troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, Where have you laid him? And they said to him, Our Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>And the tears of Jeshu came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>And the Jihudoyee said, See how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, Could not this who opened the eyes of that blind have caused also that this should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jeshu, groaning within himself, came to the house of burial; and that house of burial was a cave, and a stone was laid at the gate of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>And Jeshu said, Take up this stone. Martha, the sister of him (who was) dead, saith to him, My Lord, he now stinketh; for four days are to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jeshu said to her, Said I not to thee, that if thou wilt believe, thou shalt see the glory of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>And they took up the stone. And Jeshu lifted his eye upward, and said, Father, I give thanks to thee that thou hast heard me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>and I know that at all times thou hearest me: yet, because of this assembly which standeth, I say these (words), that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when he had said these (words), he cried with a high voice, Loozar, come without!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And he, the dead, came forth, his hands and his feet being bound with bandages, and his face in a linen cloth. Jeshu saith to them, Release him, and let (him) go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>And many of the Jihudoyee who came with Mariam, when they saw the thing which Jeshu did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>And some of them went to the Pharishee, and told them every thing that Jeshu had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>AND the chief priests and Pharishee assembled, and said, What shall we do? because this man doeth many signs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>and if we leave him thus, all men will believe on him, and the Rumoyee, coming, take away our country and our people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But one of them, whose name was Kaiapha, was the high priest of that year; and he said to them, You know not any thing,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>But this from himself he spake not, but because he was high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jeshu should die for the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not only for (that) people, but also that the children of Aloha who are dispersed he should gather into one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>And from that day they determined to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>But Jeshu himself walked not openly among the Jihudoyee, but went from thence to the region near the wilderness, to a region which was called Ephrem, and there conversed with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>NOW the petscha of the Jihudoyee drew nigh; and many went up from the country places to Urishlem before the festival, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>And they sought for Jeshu, and said one to another in the temple, What think you, that he cometh to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>But the chief priests and Pharishee had commanded that if any man knew where (he was), he should declare it to them, as that they might apprehend him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>But Jeshu six days before the petscha came to Bethania, where Loozar was, he whom Jeshu had raised from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>And they made him there a supper and Martha served, and Loozar was one of those who reclined with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>But Mariam took a vase of balsam of the finest nard, great in price, and anointed the feet of Jeshu, and wiped with her hair his feet, and the house was filled with the fragrance of the balsam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>And Jihuda Scarjuta, one of his disciples, he who would betray him said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred dinoreen, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>But this he said, not because for the poor he had care, but because he was a thief, and the purse was with him, and whatever fell into it he carried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>But Jeshu said, Let her alone. For the day of my burial had she kept it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>In all time the poor you have with you; but me you have not at all time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>And a great company of Jihudoyee who were there heard Jeshu. And they had come not on Jeshu's account only, but also to see Loozar, he whom he had raised from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests were minded to slay Loozar also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because many of the Jihudoyee on account of him had gone and believed in Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>THE day after, a great gathering of those who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jeshu was coming to Urishlem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palms, and went forth to meet him. And they cried out, saying, Aushana! Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jeshu caused to be found an ass, and sat upon him; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Tseun: behold, thy King cometh to thee, and riding on a colt, the foal of an ass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>But these the disciples knew not at that time; but when Jeshu was glorified, the disciples remembered that these were written concerning him, and (that) these (things) they had done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>But the assembly that was with him when he called Loozar from the sepulchre, and raised him from among the dead, bare witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>And on account of this, great multitudes went forth to receive him; for they had heard that this sign he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>But the Pharishee said one to another, See you that you do not profit any thing! For, behold, the whole world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were also from the Gentiles men who had ascended to worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These came and drew near to Philipos, who was of Beth-tsaida of Galila; and they requested of him, and said to him, Mari, we desire to see Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>And Philipos came and told Andreas, and Andreas and Philipos told Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>BUT Jeshu answered and said to them, The hour hath come that the Son of man may be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Amen, amen, I say to you, That a grain of wheat if it fall not and die in the earth remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth much fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loveth his life shall lose it; and he who hateth his life in this world shall keep it to the life which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any man serve me, let him come after me; and where I am, there shall be also my servant: whoever serveth me, him will my Father honour.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>but on account of this have I come unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. And the voice was heard from heaven, I have glorified, and again I glorify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>And the company who stood, heard, and they said there was thunder. But others said, An angel spake with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jeshu answered and said to them, Not on my account was this voice, but on your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world; now is the ruler of this world cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, when I have been lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>But this he said to show by what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people said to him, We have heard from the law that the Meshicha for ever abideth: how sayest thou that the Son of man is to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jeshu saith to them, A little further time is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And whoever walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the light, believe in the light, that the sons of light you may become. These spake Jeshu, and went (and) concealed himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>Yet though all these signs he had done before them, they believed not in him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of the prophet Eshaia might be fulfilled, who said, My Lord, who hath believed our report, And the arm of the Lord, to whom hath it been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Because of this they were not able to believe: Wherefore again Eshaia had said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He hath blinded their eyes, And darkened their heart, That they should not see with their eyes, And understand with their heart, And be turned, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These said Eshaia when he saw his glory, and spake concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Yet of the chiefs also many believed in him: but because of the Pharishee they did not confess, that they might not be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jeshu cried and said, He who believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who seeth me seeth him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I the light am come into the world, that every one who believeth in me might not abide in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And he who heareth my words, and doth not keep them, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejecteth me, and receiveth not my word, hath that which judgeth him: the word which I speak, that judgeth him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I of myself have not spoken, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandments are life everlasting: these therefore which I speak, as said to me my Father, so I speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jeshu saith to him, My kingdom is not from this world. If from this world were my kingdom, my servants would have fought, that I should not have been delivered to the Jihudoyee. But now my kingdom is not from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilatos saith to him, Then thou art a king? Jeshu saith to him, Thou hast said that I am a king. For this am I born, and for this I came into the world, to testify of the truth. Every one who is of the truth heareth my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilatos said to him, What is the truth? And when he had said this, he went forth again to the Jihudoyee, and said to them, I find not one cause in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you have a custom that one I should release to you at the petscha. Will you, therefore, that I release to you this King of the Jihudoyee?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilatos scourged Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers entwined a crown of thorns, and set it on his head; and they covered him with robes of purple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and said, Hail to thee, King of the Jihudoyee! and struck him upon his cheeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>And Pilatos came again forth, and said to them, Behold, I bring him to you forth, that you may know that I find nothing against him, nor one cause (of death).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>AND Jeshu came forth, having on him the crown of thorns and the robes of purple. And Pilatos said to them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>But when the chief priests and officials saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him! Pilatos saith to them, Take you him and crucify him; for I find in him no cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jihudoyee say to him, We have a law, and, according to our law, he is guilty of death, because he made himself the son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilatos heard that word, he the more feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>And he entered again the praetorium, and said to Jeshu, Whence art thou? But Jeshu gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilatos saith to him, With me speakest thou not? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and power to crucify thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jeshu saith to him, Thou against ME hast no power, no not any, unless it hath been given to thee from above: wherefore he who delivered me to thee hath a sin greater than thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>On this account Pilatos willed to release him: but the Jihudoyee cried out, If this (man) thou releasest, thou art not the friend of Cesar: for whosoever maketh himself a king is the adversary of Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>But when Pilatos heard that word, he brought Jeshu without, and sat down upon the tribunal in the place which is called the Pavement of Stones, but in Hebrew it is called Gaphiphtha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was the preparation for the petscha. AND it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jihudoyee, Behold your king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Take him away, take him away! crucify him, crucify him! Pilatos saith to them, Your king shall I crucify? The chief priests say to him, We have no king but Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then delivered he him to them, that they might crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And they took Jeshu, and led him forth, bearing his cross to a place which is called A Skull, but in Hebrew is Gogultha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>there they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jeshu in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And a tablet also wrote Pilatos, and set it on the cross; and it was thus written, This is Jeshu Natsroya, King of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>And this title many of the Jihudoyee read; for nigh to the city was the place where Jeshu was crucified; and the writing was in Hebrew and Greek and Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>And the chief priests said to Pilatos, Do not write that he is king of the Jihudoyee, but that he said, I am the king of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilatos saith, That which I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>BUT the soldiers, when they had crucified Jeshu, took his vestments and made four parts, a part unto each one of the soldiers: but his tunic was without seam, from the top woven all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>And they said one to another, Let us not rend it, but play for it by playing, (to decide) whose it shall be: and fulfilled was the scripture which had said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>They divided my garments among them, And upon my raiment did they cast the lot. These things did the soldiers. But there stood by the cross of Jeshu his mother, and the sister of his mother, and Mariam, she who was (the wife) of Cleopha, and Mariam Magdalitha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jeshu seeth his mother, and that disciple whom he loved, standing; and he said to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>and he said to that disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple received her to be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After these Jeshu knew that every thing would be accomplished, and, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>And a vessel was set (there) filled with vinegar: then they filled a sponge from the vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and offered it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>And when Jeshu had taken the vinegar, he said, Behold, it is finished! And he bowed his head, and delivered up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>THE Jihudoyee, because it was the preparation, said, Let not these bodies remain-all-night upon the cross, because the shabath has lighted: for a great day was the day of that shabath. And they besought of Pilatos that they should break the legs of those (who had been) crucified, and take them down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>And the soldiers came, and brake the legs of the first, and of that other who was crucified with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>but when they came unto Jeshu, they saw that he was dead already, and they brake not his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers struck him in his side with the lance, and forthwith there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who SAW testifieth, and the truth is his testimony; and he knoweth that the truth he hath said, that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, that A bone shall not be broken in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture which said, They shall look upon him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After these Jauseph, he who was of Rometha, begged of Pilatos, for he was a disciple of Jeshu, but secretly for fear of the Jihudoyee, that he might take the body of Jeshu: and Pilatos permitted. And he came and took the body of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nikodimos also came, he who at first had come to Jeshu by night, and he brought with him a condiment of myrrh and aloes, as a hundred lithreen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>And they took the body of Jeshu, and wrapped it in cloths and in balsams, as is the manner of the Jihudoyee to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in that place where Jeshu was crucified was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre where one yet had not been laid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>And Shemun went forth, and that other disciple, and they came to the house of burial.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>This said she, and turned herself back, and saw Jeshu standing, and knew not that it was Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jeshu saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? and whom seekest thou? But she thought he was the gardener, and said to him, Sir, if thou have taken him away, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will go (and) take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jeshu saith to her, Mariam. She turned and saith to him in Hebrew, Rabuni, which is saying, Malphona.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jeshu saith to her, Touch me not; for not yet have I ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and to your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Then went Mariam Magdalitha, and announced to the disciples that she had seen our Lord, and (that) these (words) he had spoken to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>WHEN it was the evening of that day which (was) the first in the week, and the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jihudoyee, came Jeshu, stood among them, and said to them, Peace (be) with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>This he said, and showed them his hands and his side. And the disciples rejoiced when they saw our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>AND after eight days again within were the disciples, and Thoma with them. And Jeshu came, while the doors were shut, stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace (be) with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>And he said to Thoma, Bring thy finger hither and see my hands, and bring thy hand and thrust it into my side, and be not unbelieving but believing.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>AFTER these Jeshu again showed himself to his disciples at the sea of Tiberios; and he showed (himself) thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Shemun Kipha, and Thoma who was called the Twin, and Nathanael, he who was of Kotna of Galila, and the sons of Zabdai, and two other of the disciples.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He saith to them, Cast your net on the right side of the vessel, and you shall find. And they cast (it), and could not draw the net for the multitude of fishes which it held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>And that disciple whom Jeshu loved said to Kipha, This is our Lord. But Shemun, when he heard that it was our Lord, took his tunic, and threw it over his loins, for he was naked, and cast himself into the sea to come to Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the vessel, for they were not far from the land, but as two hundred ameen, and they drew that net of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>Then when they had ascended the land, they saw coals laid, and fish laid upon them, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>And Jeshu said, Bring of the fish which you have now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>And Shemun Kipha went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: yet for all this weight that net was not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>And Jeshu said to them, Come, dine. But one of the disciples did not dare to ask him, Who is he? for they knew that it was our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>And Jeshu drew near, and took bread, and fish, and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is the third time that Jeshu was seen by his disciples when he had risen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>WHEN they had dined, Jeshu said to Shemun Kipha, Shemun bar Jona, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yes, my Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. Jeshu saith to him, Feed my lambs.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>Jeshu saith to him again the third time, Shemun bar Jona, lovest thou me? And it grieved Kipha that he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, My Lord, all things thou understandest, thou knowest that I love thee. Jeshu saith to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Amen, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thy loins and walk whithersoever thou willedst; but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another will bind thy loins, and conduct thee whither thou willest not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>But this he said, to show by what death he was to glorify Aloha. And when he had said these, he said to him, Come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>AND Shemun turned, and saw the disciple whom Jeshu loved following; he, who leaned at the supper upon the bosom of Jeshu, and said, My Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>This when Kipha saw, he said to Jeshu, My Lord, and this, what?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jeshu saith to him, If I will that this wait until I come, what (is that) to thee? Come thou after me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who hath testified of all these, and hath also written them: and we know that the truth is his testimony.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>And afterwards arose Shemun Kipha with the eleven apostles, and lifted up his voice and said to them: Men, Jihudoyee, and all who dwell at Urishlem, be this known to you, and hearken to my words.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>This, who was separated thereunto by the foreknowledge and by the will of Aloha, you delivered into the hands of the wicked, and crucified and slew.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>And this saying was pleasing before all the people; and they chose Estephanos, a man who was full of faith and the Spirit of Holiness; and Philipos, and Prokoros, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmena, and Nikolos, a proselyte of Antiokia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>And these they set before the apostles: and while praying they laid upon them the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>And the word of Aloha increased, and the number of the disciples increased in Urishlem greatly: and much people of the Jihudoyee were obedient to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>But Estephanos was filled with grace and power, and wrought signs and miracles among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>And men arose from the congregation which was called Libertinu, Kyrainoyee, and Aleksandroyee, and from Cilicia, and from Asia, and disputed with Estephanos,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>Then they sent men and instructed them to say, We have heard him speak words of blasphemy against Musha and against Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>And the chief of the priests demanded if these (things) were so?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>And the disciples heard that Shemun was in Lud the city, because it is over against Joppa, and they sent to him two men, who should pray of him not to delay to come among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>And Shemun arose and went with them. And when he was come, they brought him up to the upper room, and assembled (and) stood around him all the widows, weeping, and showing him those vestments and mantles which Tabitha had given them, while living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Shemun put forth all the men without, and fell upon his knees and prayed; and he turned towards the corpse and said Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>and when she beheld Shemun, she sat. And he reached his hand and raised her, and called the saints and widows, and gave her to them living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And this was known to all the city, and many believed in our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>And he was in Joppa days not a few, sojourning in the house of Shemun the tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>BUT in Cesarea was a certain man, a centurion, whose name was Cornelius, of the cohort which was called the Italic.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>And he was just, and feared Aloha, he and all his house: he did much alms among the people, and in all time prayed of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>This saw an angel of Aloha in a vision manifestly about the ninth hour of the day, who came in to him, and said to him, Cornelius!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And he beheld him, and feared, and said, What, my Lord? And the angel said to him, Thy prayers and thy alms have ascended for a memorial before Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send men to Joppa the city, and bring Shemun who is called Kipha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>behold, he sojourneth in the house of Shemun the tanner, which is hard by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the angel who had spoken with him had gone, he called two from the sons of his house, and a certain soldier who feared Aloha (and) who was obedient to him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and he made known to them every thing he had seen, and sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>AND the day after while they went on the way, and drew nigh to the city, Shemun ascended to the roof to pray, at the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he hungered, and desired to eat: and while they were preparing for him, there fell upon him an entrancement,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>and he saw the heavens opened, and a certain vessel bound at the four corners, and like to a great sheet, and it was let down from heaven upon the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>and in it were all animals of four feet, and reptiles of the earth, and fowls of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And a voice came to him, which said, Shemun, arise, slay, and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>And Shemun said, Not so, my Lord: for never have I eaten any thing that is profane and unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And again the second time was to him, Those (things) which Aloha cleanseth make not thou profane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This was three times done: and the vessel was elevated to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>And while Shemun wondered in himself for what (was) the vision he had seen, those men came who had been sent by Cornelius, and inquired for the house where Shemun sojourned, and they came and stood at the gate of the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>And they called there, and inquired, whether Shemun who was called Kipha there sojourned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>And while Shemun thought on the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>arise, descend and go with them, not being divided in thy mind: for I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>Then Shemun descended to those men, and said to them, I am he whom you seek: what is the occasion on which you have come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>They said to him, A certain man whose name is Cornelius, a centurion, who feareth Aloha, and of whom all the people of the Jihudoyee give witness, hath been told in a vision by an holy angel to send and bring thee to his house, and to hear words from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>And Shemun brought them in, and received them while they tarried; and he arose the day after, and went forth, and proceeded with them; and certain of the brethren of Joppa went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And the next day they entered Cesarea: but Cornelius was waiting for them, while all the sons of his family, and the friends and beloved ones whom he had, were assembled with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>AND when Shemun entered Cornelius met him, and fell and worshipped at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>And Shemun raised him, and said to him, Arise, I also am a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And while speaking with him he entered, and found many who had come thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said to them, You know that it is not lawful for a man a Jihudoya to attach to a foreign man who is not a son of his tribe. But me hath Aloha showed that I should not declare any man unclean or profane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>Wherefore I the more diligently came when you sent for me. But I ask you, on what account you have sent for me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said to him, Four days are unto this from when, behold, I am fasting; and at nine hours, while praying in my house, a certain man stood before me clothed in white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>And he said to me, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thy alms have made memorial before Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>But send to Joppa the city, and bring Shemun who is called Kipha; behold, he abideth in the house of Shemun a tanner, which is by the sea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>and he will come and speak with thee. And immediately I sent to thee, and thou hast well done to have come. And, behold, we are all before thee, and desire to hear every thing that hath been commanded thee by Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>BUT Shemun opened his mouth, and said, In truth I comprehend that Aloha is no respecter of persons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in all nations whoever feareth him and worketh righteousness is accepted of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>For (this is) the word which he hath sent to the sons of Israel, and hath announced to them peace and repose through Jeshu Meshiha,-this is the Lord of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>And you also know by the word which hath been in all Jihud (which began) from Galila after the baptism which Juhanon preached,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>concerning Jeshu who was of Natsrath, whom Aloha anointed with the Spirit of Holiness and with power: he who went about and healed those who were worn out with evil, because Aloha was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are his witnesses of all which he did in the land of Jihud and of Urishlem. This (one) himself did the Jihudoyee hang upon the tree and kill;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>and him did Aloha raise up on the third day, and gave him to be seen openly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>yet not to all the people, but to us who by Aloha were chosen to be unto him the witnesses, who ate with him and drank after his resurrection from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he commanded us to preach and to testify to the people that this is he who hath been separated by Aloha (to be) the Judge of the living and of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>And of him all the prophets testify, that whoever believeth in his name shall receive remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>And while Shemun spake these words the Spirit of Holiness overspread all who heard the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And the circumcised brethren who had come with him were astonished and amazed, because upon the Gentiles also the gift of the Spirit of Holiness was poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking with tongues; and they magnified Aloha. And Shemun said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Can any one forbid waters that they should not be baptized, they who, behold, have received the Spirit of Holiness as well as we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>Then he commanded them to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha. And they prayed of him to remain with them (certain) days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>And the apostles and brethren who were in Jihud heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>AND when Shemun had gone up to Urishlem, they who were of the circumcision contended with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, that unto men uncircumcised he had entered, and had eaten with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>And Shemun put forth in order to say to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>That while praying in Joppa I saw a vision; a certain vessel descended which was like to a sheet, and bound at the four corners: and it came down from heaven and came unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>And gazing at it I beheld in it animals of four feet, and reptiles of the earth, and fowls of the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice which said to me, Shemun, arise, slay, and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>And I said, Not so, my Lord; for nothing hath entered my mouth that is unclean or profane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>And again the voice said to me from heaven, What Aloha hath cleansed make not thou to be polluted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This was done three times, and every thing was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And at that moment three men, who had been sent to me by Cornelius from Cesarea, came and stood at the gate of the court where I was sojourning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit said to me, Go with them without doubting. And there went also with me these six brethren, and we entered into the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he related to us how he had seen in his house an angel, who stood and said to him, Send to the city Joppa, and bring Shemun who is called Kipha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>and he will speak with thee words by which thou wilt be saved, thou and all thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And when I proceeded to speak there, the Spirit of Holiness overshadowed them, as upon us from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>And I remembered the word of our Lord, who said, Juhanon baptized you with waters, but you shall be baptized with the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If then Aloha equally hath given the gift to the Gentiles who have believed in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha as we, who was I, that I should be sufficient to prohibit Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>And when these words they had heard they were silent, and they praised Aloha, and said, Now also unto the Gentiles Aloha hath given repentance unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>BUT they who had been dispersed by the tribulation that was concerning Estephanos went unto Punika, also to the region of Kypros and to Antiokia, but with any one not speaking the word unless only with the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>But of them were men of Kypros and of Kyrine; these entered into Antiokia, and discoursed with the Javnoyee, and evangelized concerning our Lord Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and many believed, and were converted unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And this was heard by the ears of the sons of the church which was at Urishlem, and they sent Bar Naba to Antiokia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>And when he came thither, and beheld the grace of Aloha, he rejoiced, and entreated them with all their heart to cleave to our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man, and full of the Spirit of Holiness and of faith, and there was added much people to our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>And he went forth to Tarsos to seek for Shaol;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>and when he had found him he brought him with him to Antiokia. And a whole year together they assembled in the church, and taught much people: from thence first in Antiokia the disciples were called Christianee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>And in those days there came from Urishlem thither prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>And one of them arose whose name was Agabos: and he made known to them by the Spirit that a great famine would be in all the land. And that famine was in the days of Claudios Caesar.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>BUT at that time Herodes the king, he who was surnamed Agripos, stretched forth hands upon some who were in the church, to ill-treat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>And he killed with the sword Jakub the brother of Juhanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And when he saw that this pleased the Jihudoyee, he added to apprehend also Shemun Kipha. And they were the days of the Phatiree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>And he apprehended him and cast him into the house of the bound, and delivered him to sixteen soldiers to keep him, that after the Petscha he might deliver him to the people of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>And while Shemun was kept in the house of the bound, constant prayer was offered by the church on his behalf unto Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>And he smote him on his side, and said to him, Arise quickly. And the chains fell from his hands. And the angel said to him, bind thy loins, and put on thy sandals. And he did so. And again he said to him, Wrap thy mantle, and come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>And he went forth, and came after him; not knowing that what was done by the hand of the angel was reality, for he thought that he saw a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And when he had passed the first and second guard, they came to the gate of iron, and it was opened to them of its own accord. And when they went forth and had passed one street, the angel departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>Then acknowledged Shemun, and said, Now know I in truth that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me from the hand of Herodes the king, and from that which the Jihudoyee had calculated against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And when he had understood, he came to the house of Mariam the mother of Juhanon, he who is surnamed Markos; because many brethren were assembled there and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And he knocked at the gate of the court, and there came forth to answer him a damsel whose name was Roda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And she knew the voice of Shemun; and for joy she opened not the gate, but returned with running, and said to them, Shemun, behold, stands at the gate of the court.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>And they said to her, Thou art altogether moved. And she contended that it was so. And they said, It may be that it is his angel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>And he beckoned to them with his hand to be silent; and entered, and showed them how the Lord had brought him out from the house of the bound. And he said to them, Show these to Jakub and to the brethren; and he departed and went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>And when it was morning there was made a great tumult among the soldiers concerning Shemun, what was become of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>But Herodes when he inquired and found him not, condemned the guards, and commanded that they should die. And he went forth from Jihud and came to Cesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>And because he was angry with the Tsuroyee and with the Tsaidonoyee, they gathered together and came to him by persuasion of Blestos the chamberlain of the king, and prayed of him that peace should be to them, because the sustenance of their country was from the kingdom of Herodes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>But upon a public day Herodes was clothed with the robe of royalty, and sat upon the tribunal, and he discoursed to an assembly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>And thus did Aloha raise him from among the dead, that again he should not return thither to see corruption; as he had said, I will give you the sure grace of David.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>And when they had gone out from among them, they besought of them that the next shabath they would speak to them these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>And when the congregation was dissolved, many Jihudoyee went after them; and also the proselytes who worshipped Aloha. And they discoursed (with) and persuaded them to cleave to the grace of Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>And when the Jihudoyee saw the great assemblage, they were filled with envy, and arose against the words which Paulos spake, and blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>But Paulos and Bar Naba said to them openly, To you it behoved first to speak the word of Aloha; but because you repel it from you, and determine against yourselves that you are not worthy of eternal life, behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For so hath our Lord commanded, as it is written, I have set thee a light to the Gentiles, To be for salvation to the ends of the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>he said to him with a high voice, To thee I say, in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, Stand upon thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>And leaping, he stood and walked. And the assembly of the people, when they saw what Paulos had done, lifted up their voice in the language of the country, and said, Gods in the likeness of men have come down unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>And they named Bar Naba, lord of the gods; and Paulos, Hermis, because he was foremost in discourse.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>and said, Men, what do you? We also are children of men liable to sufferings like you, (and) who preach to you that from these vanities you should turn unto Aloha the living, who made heaven and earth, and the seas, and all that is in them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in former generations left all nations to walk in ways of their own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>yet leaving not himself without witness, while he did them good from heaven, and sent down rain, and multiplied the fruits in their times, and filled with food and gladness their hearts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>But there came thither Jihudoyee from Ikanon and from Antiokia, and stirred up against them the people; and they stoned Paulos, and dragged him out of the city, because they thought that he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>And the disciples gathered to him, and, arising, he entered the city. AND the day after he went forth from thence with Bar Naba, and came to Derbe the city.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And when there had been much investigation, Shemun arose, and said to them, Men, brethren, you know that from the first days from my mouth did Aloha choose that the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And with this accord the words of the prophets; as when it is written,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>It hath been heard by us, that men from us have gone forth and disturbed you with words, and have subverted your souls by saying, that you should be circumcised and observe the law, whom we have not commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>On account of this we have deliberated, all being assembled, and have chosen men and sent them to you, with Paulos and Bar Naba, our beloved;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>And we have sent with them Jihuda and Shilo, that by word they may tell you the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it hath been the will of the Spirit of Holiness, and also of us, not to lay upon you greater burden beyond these things which are constraining;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>that you abstain from that which hath been sacrificed (to idols), and from blood, and from that which is strangled, and from fornication; and while you keep yourselves from these, you will be well. Be confirmed in our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>Now they who were sent came to Antiokia, and they assembled all the people and gave the epistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>And when they had read, they rejoiced and were comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>And by the word the brethren were the more strengthened, and Jihuda and Shilo established them because they were prophets also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>And when they had been there a time, the brethren dismissed them with peace unto the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>BUT Paulos and Bar Naba remained in Antiokia, and taught and preached, with many others, the word of Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>This Paulos willed to take with him; and he took and circumcised him because of the Jihudoyee who were in the place; for they all knew his father that he was an Aramoya.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And this she did many days. And Paulos was indignant, and said to that spirit, I command thee in the name of Jeshu Meshiha to come out of her. And in that hour it came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>And when her lords saw that the hope of their gain had gone from her, they laid hold on Paulos and Shilo and drew them to the public place, and brought them unto the prefects and to the chiefs of the city,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the bearers of rods went and told the prefects these words which had been spoken to them. And when they heard that they were Rumoyee, they feared.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>But he, Paulos, while he waited in Athinos, was embittered in his spirit, (for he) saw how the whole city was filled with idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>And he spake in the synagogue with the Jihudoyee, and with those who worshipped Aloha, and in the public place with those who met there daily;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>and the philosophers also who were of the doctrine of Epikuros, and others who were called Estoiku, disputed with him. And some of them said, What willeth this accumulator of words? And others said, He preaches foreign gods; because Jeshu and his resurrection he preached unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And they took him and brought him to the house of judgment which is called Arios-pagos, saying to him, Can we know what this new doctrine is which thou art preaching?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>for thou sowest foreign words in our hearing, and we desire to know what these things are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>But all the Athinoyee, and those foreigners who are there, of no other thing are careful, but to say and to hear something new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>AND as Paulos stood on Arios-pagos he said, Men of Athinos, I observe you that in all (things) you exceed in the worship of demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>As I walked about and saw the place of your worship, I found a certain altar on which was inscribed, To GOD THE HIDDEN: him then whom while not known you worship, This I declare to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>For ALOHA who made the world and all that is in it, and is himself the Lord of heaven and of earth, in temples made with hands resideth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>Neither is he served by the hands of men, nor needeth he any thing, for it is he who giveth to every man life and soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And of one blood hath he made the whole world of men to dwell upon the face of all the earth, and he hath distinguished the times by his decree, and set the limits of the dwelling of mankind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>that they should seek Aloha and inquire, and from his creatures find himself, because he is not far from every one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For in him we live, and are moved, and are; as also one of your sages hath said, From him is our descent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Men, therefore, whose descent is from Aloha, should not think that gold or silver or stone sculptured by the art and skill of man is like the Divinity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>For the times of error Aloha hath made to pass away; and in this time he commandeth all men, that every man in every place should repent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because he hath set a day in which he will judge the whole earth in righteousness by that Man whom he hath ordained; and he will convert every man to the faith of him in having raised him from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>And when they heard of resurrection from among the dead, (some) of them mocked, and (some) of them said, At another time we will hear thee concerning this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>And so Paulos went forth from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>And certain of them adhered to him and believed: but one of them was Dionosios of the judges of Arios-pagos, and a certain woman whose name was Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>AND when Paulos had gone forth from Athinos, he came unto Kurinthos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>And he found there a certain man, a Jihudoya, whose name was Akilos, who was from the country of Pontos, (and) who at that time had come from the country of Italia, himself and Priskila his wife, because Klaudios Cesar had commanded that all the Jihudoyee should go out from Ruma; and he drew near to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>(and) because he was a son of their art, he dwelt with them and wrought with them: but in their art they were tentmakers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he discoursed in the synagogue every shabath, and persuaded the Jihudoyee and the Heathens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when from Makedunia Shilo and Timotheos had come, Paulos was constrained in his speech, because the Jihudoyee arose against him and blasphemed, while he testified to them that Jeshu is the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>And he shook his garments and said to them, From now I am clean: I go unto the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And he went forth from thence, and entered into the house of a man named Titos, who worshipped Aloha; and his house adjoined the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Krispos, master of the synagogue, believed in our Lord, he and all the sons of his house. And many of the Kurinthoyee heard and believed in Aloha, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And the Lord said in a vision unto Paulos, Fear not, but speak and be not silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>for I am with thee, and no man can do thee harm; and I have much people in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>But he abode a year and six months in Kurinthos, and taught them the word of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>AND when Galion was proconsul of Akaia, they gathered together against Paulos, and brought him before the tribunal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, This (man) part from the law persuadeth men to worship Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>And when Paulos sought to open his mouth and speak, Galion said to the Jihudoyee, If it were concerning some thing of evil, or of wickedness, or of abomination, you would complain, O Jihudoyee, it would be proper for me to receive you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>but if they be questions concerning language and names, and concerning your law, let them be known among yourselves; for I am not willing to be a judge of these matters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them from his tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>And all the Heathens seized Sosthenis the presbyter of the synagogue, and beat him before the tribunal. And Galion was careless of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>And when Paulos had been there many days, he gave the salutation to the brethren, and proceeded by sea to go to Syria: and Priskila and Akilos went with him, when he had shaved his head at Kankreos, because he had vowed a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And they came to Ephesos. And Paulos entered the synagogue and discoursed with the Jihudoyee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>and they requested of him to tarry with them; and he was not willing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>for he said, It behoveth me faithfully to perform the feast which cometh at Urishlem; and if Aloha willeth, I will come again to you. And Akilos and Priskila he left at Ephesos;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>and he voyaged by sea and came to Cesarea: and he went up and wished the peace of the sons of the church, and went unto Antiokia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And when he had been there certain days, he went forth and itinerated successively through Phrygia and Galatia, confirming all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>And a certain man whose name was Apolu, a Jihudoya, who was by family of Aleksandria, and erudite in speech, and accurate in the scriptures, came to Ephesos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This was discipled in the way of the Lord, and was fervid in spirit, and he spake and taught freely concerning Jeshu, while knowing not any thing but the baptism of Juhanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he began boldly to speak in the synagogue. And when Akilos and Priskila heard him, they brought him to their house, and fully showed to him the way of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he willed to go to Akaia, the brethren were careful of him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him. And when he had gone he helped much, through grace, all the believers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he disputed forcibly against the Jihudoyee before the assemblies, while he showed from the scriptures concerning Jeshu, that he is the Meshiha.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>AND while Apolu was in Kurinthos, Paulos itinerated through the upper countries unto Ephesos; and he asked those disciples whom he found there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>Have you received the Spirit of Holiness from that you believed? They answered and said to him, It hath not been heard by us whether there be the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>He saith to them, And into what were you baptized? They said, Into the baptism of Juhanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Paulos saith to them, Juhanon baptized the people with the baptism of repentance, saying that they should believe in him who was coming after him, who is Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And when they heard these (words), they were baptized in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And Paulos laid on them the hand, and the Spirit of Holiness came upon them, and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>But all the men were twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>And Paulos entered the synagogue, and discoursed boldly three months, and persuaded concerning the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>And men of them were obdurate, and contended, and reviled the way of Aloha, before the assembly of the people. Then Paulos removed and separated from them the disciples, and every day discoursed with them in the school of a man whose name was Tyranos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this was done two years, until all who dwelt in Asia, Jihudoyee and Aramoyee, had heard the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And great power-works wrought Aloha by the hand of Paulos;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that they brought even from the garments that were upon his body napkins or wrappings, and laid them upon the sick, and the diseases went from them; and demons also went forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>BUT men, Jihudoyee, also, who went about and adjured demons, willed to adjure in the name of our Lord Jeshu over those who had unclean spirits, saying, We adjure you in the name of Jeshu whom Paulos preacheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>There were seven sons of a man, a certain Jihudoya, chief of the priests, whose name was Skeva, who did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>And that evil demon answered and said to them, Jeshu I acknowledge, and Paulos I know; but who are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom was the evil spirit sprang upon them, and was strong against them, and threw them, and they, naked and wounded, fled from that house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this was known to all the Jihudoyee and Aramoyee who dwelt in Ephesos: and fear fell upon them all, and the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha was exalted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many of those who believed came and acknowledged their sins, and confessed whatever they had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Many also of the magicians collected their writings and brought and burned them before all men; and they reckoned the price of them, and it ascended to silver five myriads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>And thus with great power prevailed and increased the faith of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>But when these were fulfilled, Paulos set in his mind to itinerate throughout all Makedunia and Akaia, and to go into Urishlem. And he said, When I shall have gone thither, it behoveth me Ruma also to see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And he sent two men of those who ministered to him to Makedunia, Timotheos and Aristos; but he remained a time in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>BUT there was made at that time a great tumult on account of the way of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For there was a certain worker of silver there whose name was Dimitrios, who made shrines of silver of Artemis, and he produced for the sons of his art great gains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>This (man) assembled all the sons of his art and those who wrought with them, and said to them, Men, you know that all our merchandise is from this work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>and you also hear and see, that not only the sons of Ephesos, but also many of all Asia, this Paulos persuadeth, and hath perverted them, saying, that there be no gods which by the hands of men are made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>And not only is this business defamed and brought to an end, but also the temple of Artemis the great goddess is reputed as nothing, and she also, the goddess of all Asia, and (whom) all the nations worship, is despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And when they heard these (words) they were filled with wrath; and they cried, and said, Great is Artemis of the Ephesoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the whole city was perturbed, and they ran together and came to the theatre; and seizing, they led with them Gaios and Aristarkos, men of Makedunia, companions of Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>AND Paulos willed to enter the theatre, and the disciples restrained him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And the chiefs of Asia, because they were his friends, sent, praying of him not to deliver himself by going into the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>But the crowd who were in the theatre were greatly commoved, and others cried other things; for many of them knew not on what account they were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>But the people of the Jihudoyee who were there appointed of them a man a Jihudoya, whose name was Aleksandros; and when he stood (forth) he signed that he would apologize to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>And when they knew that he was a Jihudoya, all of them cried with one voice, as two hours, Great is Artemis of the Ephesoyee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>And the chief of the city stilled them, saying, Men, Ephesoyee, who is there of mankind who knoweth not that the city of the Ephesoyee is a votaress of the great Artemis, and of her image which descended from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Therefore, since no man can contradict this, it behoves you to be silent, and to do nothing in haste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>Yet have you brought these men who have neither spoiled temples nor blasphemed our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>But if this Dimitrios and the sons of his craft have strife with any man, behold, the proconsul is in the city, (and) there are officers: let them go nigh and judge one with another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>And if you require other (procedure), in the place which is given by the law for an assembly it shall be resolved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For now also are we standing in peril of being accused as disturbers, because we cannot make excuse for the concourse of this day, inasmuch as we have met uselessly, and have made a tumult without cause.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>and was there three months. But the Jihudoyee wrought treachery against him, when he was about to go into Syria, and had thought to return into Makedunia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And (there) went forth with him into Asia Supatros who was from Berula, the city; and Aristarkos and Sakundos, who (were) from Thessalonika; and Gaios, who was from Derbe the city; and Timotheos, who was from Lystra; and from Asia, Tukikos and Trophimos.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>And there were many lamps of fire in the high-room where we were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain youth whose name was Eutikos sat in a window and heard. And he had sunk into a heavy sleep while Paulos prolonged his discourse, and in his sleep he fell from the third floor, and was taken up as dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>and when they came to him, he said to them: You know, that from the first day that I entered Asia, how I was with you all time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving Aloha in much lowliness and with tears, and in those temptations which passed upon me through the devices of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>Neither neglected I any thing that was profitable for your souls, that I might preach to you and teach in public places and in houses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>while I testified to Jihudoyee and to Aramoyee concerning repentance that is toward Aloha, and faith which is in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>THEN answered Paulos and said, What do you, weeping and bruising my heart? For not to be bound only am I prepared, but also to die in Urishlem, for the sake of the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And when he would not be persuaded by us, we desisted, and said, The will of our Lord be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>And after those days we prepared and went up to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>And there went with us men, disciples, from Cesarea, who conducted with them a certain brother of the first disciples whose name was Mnason, and he was from Kypros, to receive us into his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>And when we were come to Urishlem, the brethren received us joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>And the day following we entered with Paulos to Jakub, while all the presbyters were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And we gave them salutation. And Paulos recounted to them in order what Aloha had done among the Gentiles by his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And when they heard, they glorified Aloha. And they said to him, Thou seest, our brother, how many myriads there are in Jihud who believe, and all of them are zealous for the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>But it hath been said to them of thee, that thou teachest all the Jihudoyee who are among the Gentiles to remove from Musha; telling them that they should not circumcise their sons, nor walk in the customs of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>On this account, when they hear that thou art come hither, do that which we tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>We have four men who have a vow to be purified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take them, and go, purify with them, and lay out upon them the expenses, that they may shave their heads; and it will be known to every man that what hath been said against thee is false, and that thou fulfillest and keepest the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>Concerning those of the Gentiles who believe, we wrote that they should keep themselves from sacrifices, and from fornication, and from the strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took those men the day after, and was purified with them. And he entered and went into the temple, making known to them the fulfillment of the days of the purification, so that an oblation might be offered for each man of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>And when the seventh day was come the Jihudoyee who were from Asia saw him in the temple, and stirred up against him all the people. And they lifted their hands against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying out, and saying, Men, sons of Israel, help! This is the man who contrary to our people teacheth every where, and contrary to the law, and against this place. And also Aramoyee hath he brought into the temple, and profaned this holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had before seen with him Trophimus the Ephesian in the city, and supposed that with Paulos he had entered the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And the whole city was commoved, and all the people assembled, and they laid hold of Paulos, and dragged him without from the temple; and instantly the gates were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And while the multitude sought to kill him, the tribune of the cohort heard that the whole city was agitated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>And forthwith took he a centurion and many soldiers and ran upon them; and when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they desisted from beating Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>And the tribune drew near and took him, and commanded them to bind him with two chains. And he asked concerning him who (he was), and what he had done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>And men from the crowd cried against him variously, and because of their crying he was not able to know what was the truth; and he commanded that they should lead him to the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>And as Paulos came to the stairs the soldiers carried him, on account of the violence of the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for after him was much people; and they cried, and said, Away with him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>And as they came to enter into the fortress, Paulos himself said to the tribune, May I be permitted to speak to the people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>But he said to him, Javanith knowest thou? Art thou not that Metsroya who before these days stirred up and led forth into the waste four thousand men workers of evils?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>Paulos said to him, I am a man a Jihudoya from Tarsos of Cilicia, an illustrious city in which I was born: I pray you permit me to speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And when he had permitted him, Paulos stood upon the stairs, and signed to them with his hand; and when they had ceased, he spoke to them in Hebrew, and said to them,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Brethren and fathers, hear the defence which I make to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And when they heard that Hebrew he was speaking with them, the more they ceased; and he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>I am a man a Jihudoya; and I was born in Tarsos of Cilicia, but was brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed perfectly in the law of our fathers. And I was zealous for Aloha, even as all of you are also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>And this way I persecuted unto the death, while I bound and delivered to the house of the bound both men and women;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as the chief of the priests can testify of me, and all the elders, that from them I received letters to go to the brethren who were in Darmsuk, that also them who were there I should bring to Urishlem bound, that they might be fined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>And as I went, and began to approach Darmsuk in the dividing of the day, suddenly from heaven there shone upon me a great light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>and I fell upon the earth, and heard a voice, which said to me, Shaol, Shaol, why persecutest thou me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>But I answered and said, Who art thou, my Lord? And he said to me, I am Jeshu Natsroya, whom thou persecutest!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>And the men who were with me saw the light, but the voice they understood not which spake with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And I said, What shall I do, my Lord? And he said to me, Arise, go into Darmsuk, and there shall it be told thee of whatever it is commanded thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And while I could not see because of the glory of that light, they who were with me took me by my hands, and I entered Darmsuk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And a man, one Hanania, righteous in the law, as the Jihudoyee who were there testified of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came to me, and said to me, Shaol, my brother, open thine eyes. And in a moment my eyes were opened, and I beheld him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said to me, The God of our fathers hath appointed thee to know his will, and to see that Just One, and to hear the voice from his lips,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>that thou mayest be a witness to all men of all that thou hast seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now why delayest thou? Arise, baptize, and be washed from thy sins, while thou callest his Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And being returned, I came hither to Urishlem. And I prayed in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>And I saw him in a vision, when he said to me, Hasten, and remove thee from Urishlem: for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, My Lord, they know also how I delivered to the house of the bound, and smote in all the synagogues, those who have believed in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And when the blood of thy martyr Estephanos was shed, I also stood with them, and fulfilled the will of his murderers, and kept the garments of them who stoned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And he said to me, Go: for I send thee far away to preach to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And when they had heard Paulos until this word, they lifted up their voice, and cried, Take from the earth one like this; for he ought not to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they shouted and cast their garments and threw dust to the heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the tribune commanded that he should be brought into the fortress, and commanded him to be questioned by scourging, that he might know for what cause they cried against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as they exposed him with thongs, Paulos said to the centurion who stood near him, Is it allowed you to scourge a Roman man who is not condemned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And when the centurion heard, he approached the tribune, and said to him, What doest thou? For this is a Roman man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>And the tribune approached him, and said to him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said to him, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>The tribune answered, and said to him, I with much money purchased the Roman-right. Paulos said to him, But I was born in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>And immediately those who had sought to scourge him desisted from him; and the tribune feared when he learned that he was a Roman, because he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>AND the day after he willed to know truly what was the accusation which the Jihudoyee brought against him. And he ordered him and commanded the great priests and all the synagogue of their rulers to come; and he took Paulos and brought (him) down, and stood him among them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paulos, looking upon their assembly, said, Men, brethren, I in all good conscience have conversed before Aloha, unto this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And Hanania the priest commanded them who stood by him to smite Paulos upon his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>And Paulos said to him, It will be that Aloha will smite thee, (thou) whitened wall: thou sittest to judge me according to the law, while thou transgressest the law, and commandest that they smite me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And they who stood there said to him, The priest of Aloha revilest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Paulos said to them, I knew not, my brethren, that he is the priest; for it is written, Of the chief of thy people thou shalt not speak evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>And when Paulos knew that (part) of the people were of the Zadukoyee and (part) of it of the Pharishee, he cried in the assembly, Men, my brethren, I am a Pharisha, the son of Pharishee; and for the hope of the resurrection of the dead am I judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he had said this, the Pharishee and the Zadukoyee fell on one another, and the people was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Zadukoyee say that there is no resurrection, nor angels, nor spirit; but the Pharishee confess all these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there was made a great noise. And certain sophree of the choice of the Pharishee arose and contended with them, and said, We have not found any thing of evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel hath spoken with him, what is there in this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And when there was a great commotion among them, the tribune feared lest they should tear Paulos in pieces, and he sent to the Rumoyee to come and carry him away from the midst of them, and take him into the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And when it was night our Lord appeared unto Paulos, and said to him, Be strong: for as thou hast testified of me in Urishlem, so is it to be that thou also in Ruma shalt testify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>AND when it became morning, men of the Jihudoyee gathered and bound a vow upon themselves, that they would not eat or drink till they had killed Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>But there were of those who established by oath this compact more than forty men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>And they drew nigh to the priests and to the elders, and said, A vow we have vowed upon us, that nothing will we taste until we have killed Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>And now do you and the princes of the synagogue request from the tribune to bring him to you, as if you sought to investigate more truly his work, and we are prepared to kill him while he shall come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>And the son of the sister of Paulos heard this plot, and he entered the fortress and informed Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paulos sent (and) called one of the centurions, and said to him, Bring this youth to the tribune, for he has somewhat to tell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>And the centurion conducted the youth, and introduced him to the tribune, and said, Paulos the prisoner called me, and requested of me to bring this youth to thee, because he hath somewhat to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the tribune took the youth by his hand, and led him on one side, and asked him, What hast thou to tell me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And the youth said to him, The Jihudoyee have determined to request of thee to send down Paulos, tomorrow, to their synagogue, as if willing to learn somewhat more from him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>thou therefore yield not to them; for, behold, more than forty men of them watch for him in ambush, and have bound a curse upon themselves, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him: and, behold, they are ready, and wait thy promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>And the tribune dismissed the youth, when he had admonished him, Let no man know that these thou hast informed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And he called two centurions, and said to them, Go, prepare two hundred Romans to go to Cesarea, and seventy horsemen and right-handed spearmen two hundred, to go forth at the third hour of the night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>but provide also a beast to carry Paulos, and escape to Felix the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote a letter, and gave it to them, which was thus:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Klaudios Lusios unto Felix the victorious governor, peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>The Jihudoyee had seized this man to kill him; and I arose with the Romans and rescued him, when I had learned that he is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And when I sought to know the occasion of which they accused him, I brought him down to their synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>And I found that concerning questions of their law they accused him; and a cause worthy of bonds or of death was not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And when it was told me of the treachery of a plot which the Jihudoyee wrought against him, I straightway sent him to thee; and I have commanded his accusers to come and speak with him before thee. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>Then the Rumoyee, as they had been commanded, took Paulos by night, and brought him to Antipatros the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>and the day after the horsemen sent away their foot-companions to return to the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>And they came to Cesarea. And they gave the letter to the governor, and made Paulos stand before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And when he had read the letter, he asked him from what province he was. And when he had heard that (he was) from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said to him, I will hear thee when thy accusers have come. And he commanded that they should keep him in the pretorium of Herodes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>AND after five days Hanania the great priest came down with the elders, and with Tartelos a rhetor, and informed the governor against Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And being called, Tartelos came forth to accuse him, and said, For many years have we dwelt (in peace) through thee, and many reformations have been made for this people in the bearing of thy office;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>and all we in every place receive thy bounty, victorious Felix.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But, not to weary thee with many (words), I pray thee to hear our humbleness with brevity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man to be a destroyer, and an exciter of agitation among all the Jihudoyee, and in all the land: for he is a chief of the doctrine of the Natsroyee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>and he willed to pollute our temple; and having apprehended him, we sought to judge him according to our law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>but Lusios the tribune came, and with great force transferred him from our hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>and hath sent him unto thee, and commanded his accusers to come to thee; and thou canst by questioning him learn from him concerning all these things of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jihudoyee themselves also contended against him, saying, that so these things were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>And the governor signed to Paulos to speak. And Paulos answered, and said, For many years I know that thou hast been the judge of this people, and on this account I joyfully make defence for myself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>while thou shouldst know that it hath not been more than twelve days since I went up to Urishlem to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>Neither found they me speaking with any man in the temple, neither have I gathered an assembly in their synagogue nor in the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>nor is it in their power to demonstrate before thee any thing of what they accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>Nevertheless, this do I confess, that in that very doctrine of which they speak, in it serve I the God of my fathers, believing in all that is written in the law and in the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>and having hope in Aloha that which they also hope: that there shall be a resurrection from the house of the dead, of the just and of the evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>Because of this also I labour to have a good conscience before Aloha and before men, continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>But after many years I came to the sons of my people to bestow alms, and to present an oblation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>And these found me in the temple being purified, not with a concourse nor with tumult; but men Jihudoyee who had come from Asia raised a tumult;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>(and) these it behoved to stand with me before thee, and to accuse of that whatever they have (against me).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these themselves declare, what crime they found in me, when I stood before their assembly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>unless for this one word which I proclaimed while standing in the midst of them, For the resurrection of the dead am I judged this day before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>But Felix, because he knew this way fully, delayed them, saying, When the tribune comes I will hear between you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And he commanded the centurion to keep Paulos in quietude, and that none of his acquaintances should be hindered from ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after a few days Felix, and Drusilla his wife, who was a Jihudoytha, sent and called Paulos, and they heard from him concerning the faith of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he discoursed with them of righteousness, and of holiness, and of the judgment which is to come, Felix was filled with fear, and he said, Now go, and when I have opportunity I will send for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>For he hoped that a bribe would be given him by Paulos, and on this account he continually sent to bring him, and to speak with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>And when two years were fulfilled to him, another governor came in his place, who was called Porcios Festos. But Felix, as to do a favour to the Jihudoyee, left Paulos bound.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>And when Festos came to Cesarea, after three days he went up to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>And the chief priest and elders showed him concerning Paulos, and besought from him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking of him this favour, that he would bring him to Urishlem, while they would act treacherously in the way by killing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>And Festos returned the word, That Paulos was kept in Cesarea, and I am hastening to proceed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>let those therefore of you who are able, go down with us, and accuse him of whatever guilt there is in the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And when he had been there eight days or ten, he went down to Cesarea. And the day after he sat on the tribunal, and commanded to bring Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he had come, the Jihudoyee who had come down from Urishlem surrounded him, and accusations many and hard brought against him, which they were not able to prove;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>while Paulos put forth the mind, that he had not offended in any thing, neither against the law of the Jihudoyee, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festos, because he willed to accord a favour to the Jihudoyee, said to Paulos, Art thou willing to go up to Urishlem, and there concerning these things to be judged before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>Paulos answered, and said, At the tribunal of Caesar stand I. There it is right for me to be judged. Not any thing have I transgressed against the Jihudoyee, as also thou knowest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>and if a crime I have committed, or any thing worthy of death, I ask not (to be exempted) from death. But, if there be nothing in me of which these accuse me, no man shall give me to them as a gift. I invoke the appeals of Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festos, having spoken with the sons of his council, said, The appeals of Caesar hast thou invoked? To Caesar goest thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>AND when days had been, Agripos the king and Bernike came down to Cesarea to salute Festos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And when they had been with him (some) days, Festos recounted to the king the judgment of Paulos, saying, A certain man has been left bound by Felix;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>and when I was at Urishlem, the chief priests and elders of the Jihudoyee informed me against him, and begged that I would do for them judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>And I told them, it was not the custom of the Romans to give any man as a gift to be killed, until his adversaries have come and accused him to his face, and there be given him place to defend himself against that of which he is accused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>And when I had come hither, without delay, the day after I sat on the tribunal, and commanded to bring the man to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>And his accusers stood up with him, but could not find any evil accusation to prove against him, (such) as I had expected,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but (had) various questions with him regarding their worship, and concerning Jeshu, a man who was dead, of whom Paulos said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And because I stood not upon the investigation of these (matters), I said to Paulos, Dost thou require to go to Urishlem, and there be judged concerning these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But he required to be kept unto the judgment of Caesar; and I commanded that he should be kept until I may send him to Caesar.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>And the day after came Agripos and Bernike with great pomp, and entered the house of judgment, with the tribunes and the chiefs of the city. And Festos commanded, and Paulos came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festos said, King Agripos, and all men who are with us, concerning this man whom you see have all the people of the Jihudoyee taken me at Urishlem and here, crying, that This ought not further to live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>but I perceived not that he had done any thing worthy of death. And because he required to be reserved for the judgment of Caesar, I have commanded that he should be sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>But (as) I know not what to write of him unto Caesar, therefore have I willed to bring him before you, and especially before thee, king Agripos, that, having inquired into his case, I may find what to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it is not fit when we send a man bound, not to record his transgression.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>And Agripos said to Paulos, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paulos stretched forth his hand and made defence, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>Of all that I am accused by the Jihudoyee, king Agripos, I consider myself happy, that before you I (have to) make defence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>Especially because I know that you are conversant with all questions and laws of the Jihudoyee; therefore, I pray you with patient mind to hear me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>For the Jihudoyee themselves-if they would testify-know my manners from my youth, which were mine from the beginning among my people at Urishlem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>because they of a long time were assured of me, and they know that in the high doctrine of the Pharishee I lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now, concerning the hope of the promise that was made to our fathers by Aloha, stand I, and am judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>And for this hope (to which) our twelve tribes, with diligent prayers by day and night, are expecting to come, for this very hope am I accused by the Jihudoyee, king Agripos!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>What judge you; ought we not to believe that Aloha will raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>For I, at the first, proposed in my mind to do many things against the name of Jeshu Natsroya.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>This I also did in Urishlem. And many holy ones I cast into the house of the bound, by the authority which I had received from the great priests; and when they were killed by them, I participated with those who condemned them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And in every synagogue I was furious against them, while I constrained them to blaspheme the name of Jeshu; and, being filled with great wrath against them, I went forth unto other cities also to persecute them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>And while going on this account to Darmsuk, with authority and permission from the great priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at the dividing of the day, in the way, I saw from heaven, O king, shining upon me and upon all who were with me, a light which (was) more excellent than the sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And we fell all of us upon the earth; and I heard a voice that said to me in Hebrew, Shaol, Shaol, why persecutest thou me? It is hard to thee to kick against the pricks!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who art thou, my Lord? And he said, I am Jeshu Natsroya, whom thou persecutest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>And he said to me, Stand upon thy feet, because for this I have appeared to thee, to appoint thee a minister and witness of that (for) which thou hast seen me, and (for) which thou shalt see me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>And I will deliver thee from the people of the Jihudoyee, and from the other nations to whom I send thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan unto Aloha, and receive the forgiveness of sins, and a lot with the saints through faith, which (is) in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>Wherefore, king Agripos, I withstood not with perversity the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but preached, at first to them who were in Darmsuk, and to them who were at Urishlem, and in all the districts of Jihud, and also to the Gentiles have I preached, that they should repent, and turn to Aloha, and do works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>And for these things the Jihudoyee seized me in the temple, and would have killed me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>but Aloha hath helped me until this day; and, behold, I stand and testify to the small and to the great, yet nothing beyond Musha and the prophets do I speak, but those things which they said should come to pass;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the Meshiha should suffer, and should be the chief of the resurrection from the house of the dead, and should preach light to the people and to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>AND as Paulos was thus making defence, Festos cried with a high voice, Thou art mad, Paulos; much learning hath made thee mad!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>Paulos said to him, I am not mad, victorious Festos, but words of truth and righteousness I speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>And king Agripos also, especially, knoweth concerning these things; and therefore speak I with openness before him; because not one of these things I think have been hidden from him; for they were not done in secrecy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>Believest thou, king Agripos, the prophets? I know that thou believest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>King Agripos said to him, (Within) a little thou persuadest me to become a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paulos said, I would from Aloha that in little and in much, not only thou, but also all who hear me to-day, were as I am, except these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And the king arose, and the governor, and Bernike, and those who sat with them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>and when they were removed thence they spake one with another, and said, Nothing that is worthy of death or of bonds hath this man done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agripos said to Festos, This man could have been dismissed, if he had not called the appeal of Caesar.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And Festos commanded concerning him that he should be sent unto Caesar in Italia. And he delivered Paulos, and other prisoners with him, to a certain man, a centurion of the band of Sebaste, whose name was Julios.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And when he would proceed, we went down to a ship which was from Adramantos the city, to go to the region of Asia. And Aristarkos, a Makedonoya who was of Thessalunike the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>entered the ship with us. And the day after we came to Tsaidon. And the centurion behaved with kindness towards Paulos, and permitted him to go to his friends and be refreshed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And from thence we voyaged; and because the winds were contrary we made a circuit unto Cypros.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And we went through the sea of Cilicia and of Pamphulia, and came to Mura, a city of Lukia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And the centurion found there a ship from Aleksandria which was going to Italia, and he placed us in her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And because she sailed heavily, (after) many days we had scarce come over against Knidos the island, and as the wind did not permit us to go directly, we went round by Kreta against Salmona the city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>and hardly voyaging we passing around it came to the place which is called the Fair Havens. AND it was nigh to the city named Lasia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And we were there much time, until the day when the day of the fast of the Jihudoyee had also passed, and there had become danger for one to voyage by sea. And Paulos counselled them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>and said, Men, I perceive that with distress and much loss we are to voyage, not only to the burden of the ship, but also to our own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion hearkened to the governor and to the lord of the ship rather than to the counsel of Paulos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And because that haven was not convenient to winter in, many of us desired to proceed thence, and if possible to come and winter in a certain harbour in Kreta, called Phoniks, and which looked to the south.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And when the wind of the south blew, and we thought we could come as we desired, we sailed round Kreta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>And after a little there came forth against us a blowing of the tempest which is called Tuphonikos Euroklidon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>and the ship was carried away, and could not stand against the wind, and we gave her into its hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And when we had passed a certain isle that is called Cyra; we could scarcely take up the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>And when we had uplifted her, we girded and strengthened the ship. And because we feared lest we should fall into the precipitancy of the sea, we brought down the sails, and so went forward.i</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And while there rose against us the hard tempest, the next day we threw the goods into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And the third day the things of the ship itself we cast forth. And when the storm had held more days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>and neither the sun was seen, nor the moon, nor stars, the hope that we should be saved at all was cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>And while no man had taken any food, then stood Paulos among them, and said, Men, if you had been persuaded by me, you would not have voyaged from Kreta, and we should have been exempted from loss, and from this distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>Yet now I counsel you to be without anxiety; for not one of you will perish, but the ship only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For in this night there appeared to me the angel of Aloha, (of) him whose I am, and whom I serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>And he said to me, Fear not, Paulos, for thou art to stand before Caesar; and, behold, Aloha hath given thee the gift of all who voyage with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Therefore, men, take courage; for I believe Aloha, that so it shall be as he hath told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>Nevertheless, upon a certain island we have to be cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>AND after fourteen days (in) which we had wandered and been beaten in the sea of Hadrios, in the dividing of the night, the mariners thought that we drew nigh to land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>And they cast the lead, and found twenty cubits; and again a little they proceeded, and found fifteen cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>And fearing lest we should be found in a place in which were rocks, they cast forth from the hinder part of the ship four anchors, and prayed that it would become day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>But the mariners sought to escape from the ship, and lowered from her the boat into the sea, on the pretext that they would go in her, and bind the ship to the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>And when Paulos saw, he said to the centurion and to the soldiers, If these in the ship remain not, you cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then cut the soldiers the cable of the boat from the ship, and let her drive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>But Paulos himself, until it was morning, persuaded all of them to take food, saying to them, To-day it is fourteen days (in which) from danger you have tasted nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Wherefore I beseech you receive meat for the establishment of your lives; for a hair of the head of one of you will not perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And when these he had said, he took bread, and praised Aloha before them all, and he broke and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>And they were all comforted, and received food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>But we were in the ship two hundred and seventy and six souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And when they were satisfied with food, they lightened the ship, and took up the wheat and sent it into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when it was day, the sailors knew not what land it was; but they saw along the coast a certain inlet of the sea, (into) which they purposed if possible to drive the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And they cut the anchors from the ship, and left them in the sea, and they loosed the bands of the oars, and raised a small sail to the wind which blew, and went forward to the face of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>And the ship struck on a high place between two depths of the sea, and infixed herself in it; and her forepart stood upon it, and was immovable, but her afterpart was loosed from the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the soldiers would have killed the prisoners, lest they should cast forth to swim, and escape from them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>and the centurion restrained them from this, because he was willing to save Paulos. And those who could cast forth to swim he commanded to be the first to swim, and to pass to the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>And the rest, on boards, and on other timbers of the ship, passed; and thus all of them escaped to land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>AND afterwards we learned that Melita was called that island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the Barbaroyee who dwelt in it many kindnesses showed us. And they kindled a fire, and called all of us to warm, because there was great rain and cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>And Paulos took many sticks and placed upon the fire; and there came forth a viper from the heat of the fire, and bit (him) in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the Barbaroyee saw it hang upon his hand, they said, Perhaps this man is a murderer, whom, though he is escaped from the sea, justice suffereth not to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>But Paulos shook his hand, and cast the viper into the fire, and nothing of evil befell him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But the Barbaroyee expected that he would immediately have swelled and fallen dead upon the ground; and when they had for a great while expected and saw that nothing of evil befell him, they changed their words, and said he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>But there were possessions in that place (belonging) to a certain man whose name was Publios, who himself was the chief of the island; and he cheerfully received us into his house three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>But the father of Publios was ill in a fever, and a disease of the bowels. And Paulos went in to him, and prayed and laid his hand on him, and healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>And when this was done, the rest also of them who were diseased in the island came to him and were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>And with great honours they honoured us; and when we went forth from thence they supplied us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>But we went forth after three months and voyaged in an Alexandrine ship which had wintered at the island; and she had upon her the sign of the Twins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And we came to Sarakosa the city, and remained there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>And from thence we went round and came to Regium the city. And after one day the south wind blew, and in two days we came to Putialos, a city of Italia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>And we found there brethren, and they prayed of us, and we were with them seven days, and then went we unto Ruma.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And when the brethren who were there heard, they came forth to meet us unto the street that is called Apios Foros, and unto the Three Taverns. And when Paulos saw them he thanked Aloha, and was strengthened.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning his Son, who was born, according to the flesh, of the seed of the house of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>and is known (to be) the Son of Aloha by power, and by the Holy Spirit, who raised him from among the dead, Jeshu Meshiha our Lord:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>WHEREFORE Aloha delivered them up to passions of vileness: for their females changed the use of their nature, and to what is not natural were used.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>And also their males likewise left the natural use of their females, and were inflamed with concupiscence one with another, and male with male wrought shamefulness, and the just retribution for their perverseness in themselves received.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And as they did not decide in themselves to know Aloha, so did Aloha cause them to be delivered up to a mind of vainness, and to do what is not fit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>being filled with all wickedness, and uncleanness, and rancour, and malice, and rapacity, and envy, and murder, and contention, and deceit, and evil imaginings, and murmurings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>and slanders, and hating of Aloha: vilifiers, inflated ones, boasters, inventors of evil things, mindless, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>(men) to whom a compact is nothing, and (who) neither love peace nor (have) mercy in them; who,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>knowing the judgment of Aloha, that they who these things do, unto death are condemned, (yet) not only do them, but also participate with those who do them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What then is the excellence of the Jihudoya, and what the profit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every thing: primarily that they had intrusted (to them) the words of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For if some of them believed not, would their unbelief abolish the faithfulness of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>Not so: for Aloha is true, and every man a liar; as it is written, That thou mayest be just in thy words, And triumph when they judge thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our iniquity the righteousness of Aloha establisheth, what shall we say? Is Aloha evil, who bringeth his wrath? As a man do I speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>But the righteousness of Aloha is by faith of Jeshu Meshiha, unto all and also upon all who believe in him. For there is no distinction:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned, and have failed of the glory of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>and all are justified by grace freely, and (that) through the redemption which is in Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom Aloha before ordained (to be) a propitiation through faith in his blood for our sins which from the first we had sinned, within the space which Aloha hath given to us in his patience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>unto the manifestation of his righteousness which (is) in this time: that he might be just, and might justify in righteousness him who is in the faith of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>Because one is Aloha, who justifieth the circumcision by faith, also the uncircumcision by the same faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Do we therefore the law abolish by faith? Not so, but the law itself we establish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then say we of Abraham, the chief of the fathers, that he found in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham by works was justified, he had cause for boasting; but not with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what saith the scripture? That Abraham believed Aloha, and he reckoned it to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>But to him who worketh, his wages are not reckoned to him as of favour, but as that which is owing to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>but to him who worketh not, but believeth only in him who justifieth sinners, his faith is reckoned to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>As also David hath spoken concerning the blessedness of the man to whom Aloha reckoneth righteousness without works, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>Blessed are they whose iniquity is forgiven, And whose sins are covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man to whom Aloha reckoneth not his sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Is this blessedness, then, upon the circumcision (only), or upon the uncircumcision (also)? Now we have said, that his faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>When, then, was it reckoned to him? In circumcision or in uncircumcision? It was not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>For he received the sign of circumcision (as) a seal of the righteousness of his faith, which (was his) in uncircumcision, that he should be the father of all them who believe of the uncircumcision; that it might be accounted also to them for righteousness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and the father of the circumcision, not of them who are of the circumcision only, but of them who pursue the footsteps of the faith of uncircumcision of our father Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>FOR not through the law was the promise unto Abraham and to his seed that he should be the heir of the world, but through the righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if they who are of the law were heirs, faith would be vain, and the promise be abolished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>For the law is the worker of wrath. For where there is no law, there also is no transgression of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore it is by faith, which is through grace, that we are justified, that the promise might be firm unto all his seed; not to that which is of the law only, but also to that which is of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(as it is written, I have ordained thee the father of many nations before Aloha, in whom thou hast believed, who maketh alive the dead, and calleth those who are not as though they were:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>and who, without hope, unto hope believed that he should be the father of many nations, as it is written, that " so shall be thy seed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>Nor was he weak in his faith, while considering his body dead, (for he was the son of an hundred years,) and the dead womb of Sara;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>and at the promise of Aloha he wavered not as deficient in faith, but was strong in faith, and gave glory to Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and was sure that what he had promised to him Aloha could fulfil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>Wherefore it was reckoned to him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>And not for his sake only was this written, that his faith was reckoned for righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but for our sake, because it should be reckoned to us also who believe in Him who hath raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered for our sins, and rose that he might justify us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>BECAUSE, then, we are justified by faith, we have peace with Aloha through our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>And by him we have been admitted through faith into this grace in which we stand, and exult in hope of the glory of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not thus only, but also in afflictions we exult; for we know that affliction perfecteth patience in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and patience experience, and experience hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>but hope maketh us not ashamed, because the love of Aloha is shed forth upon our hearts by the Spirit of Holiness who is given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>But if the Meshiha on account of our infirmity in this time for the wicked hath died:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>for hardly for the wicked one dieth; for on account of the good one may perhaps dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>Nevertheless Aloha hath manifested his love for us, in that, when we were sinners, the Meshiha for us died:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>how much more, then, shall we be now justified through his blood, and by him be delivered from wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if, while we were adversaries, Aloha was reconciled with us through the death of his Son, how much more, then, in reconciliation with him, shall we be saved by his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not thus only, but we also exult in Aloha through our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, by whom we have now received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>As by one man sin entered into the world, and by sin death, so death hath passed upon all men through this, that all have sinned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>For until the law, sin, while it was in the world, was not reckoned sin, because the law was not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>yet death reigned from Adam until Musha on them also who had not sinned after the manner of the transgression of the law of Adam, who was the type of him who was to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But not as was the fall, so is the gift; for if, on account of the fall of one, many died, how much more the grace of Aloha, and his gift, for the sake of one man, Jeshu Meshiha, in many will abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And not as the transgression of one, so is the gift; for the judgment that was by one was unto condemnation, but the gift (which saves) from many sins was unto righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if because of the transgression of one death was made to reign, much more (shall) they who receive the abundance of the grace and of the gift and of righteousness, reign in life by one, Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>As then on account of the transgression of one was the condemnation of all men, so, on account of the righteousness of one shall there be acquittal unto the life of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For as on account of the disobedience of one man many became sinners, so also on account of the obedience of one many became righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But the entrance which was of the law, (made) sin to increase; and where sin increased, there grace hath abounded:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>that as sin hath reigned in death, so grace might reign in righteousness unto the life which is eternal, by the hand of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>WHAT, then, shall we say, Let us remain in sin, that grace may abound?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or do you not know, that they who have been baptized into Jeshu Meshiha, into his death have been baptized?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>BUT know you not, my brethren, for to those who know the law I speak, that the law has authority over a man as long as he liveth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>as a woman who is bound in law to her husband as long as he liveth; but if her husband be dead, she is freed from the law of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>But if, while her husband lives, she adhere to another man, she becometh an adulteress; but if her husband shall die, she is freed from the law, and is not an adulteress, though she become (the wife) of another man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>And now, my brethren, you also are dead to the law, through the body of the Meshiha, that you should be married to another, (namely, to) him who rose from the dead, that you may render fruit unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For while we were in the flesh, the affections of sin, which are against the law, wrought powerfully in our members to yield fruits unto death;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What then, say we the law is sin? Not so. But sin I had not learned (to know) but by the law: for I had not known concupiscence (to be sinful), but (by) the law, which hath said, Thou shalt not covet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>And by this commandment sin found for itself an occasion, and completed in me all concupiscence. For without the law sin was dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And that commandment of life was found to me (to tend) unto death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, by the occasion it found through the commandment, deceived me, and thereby killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>The law therefore is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>The good, then, unto me, unto death was made? Not so. But sin, that it might be seen what sin is, by the good (law) effected death in me, that sin might be the more condemned by the commandment.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>And if the thing that I will not I do, it is not I who do it, but sin which dwelleth in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>I find then a law which accordeth with my mind, that willeth to do good, because evil is near to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I rejoice in the law of Aloha in the interior man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>but I see another law in my members, which warreth against the law of my mind, making me captive to the law of sin that is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I give thanks to Aloha! (it is) by the hand of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha. Now then, I in my mind am the servant of the law of Aloha, but in my flesh I am the servant of the law of sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>Hence, there is no condemnation to them who do not walk according to the flesh, in Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life, which is in Jeshu Meshiha, hath set thee free from the law of sin and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>Because the law was weak through the infirmity of the flesh, Aloha sent his Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin, on account of sin to condemn sin in his flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>that the righteousness of the law might in us be fulfilled, who walk not in the flesh, but in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For they who are in the flesh, of that flesh are mindful; and they who are of the Spirit, of that Spirit are mindful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the mind of the flesh is death, and the mind of the Spirit life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the mind of the flesh is enmity towards Aloha; for to the law of Aloha it is not subject, for it cannot be;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>and they who are in the flesh cannot please Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if truly the Spirit of Aloha dwelleth in you. But if a man have not the Spirit of the Meshiha, this (man) is not his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>And if the Meshiha be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the Spirit is life because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>And if the Spirit of him who raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead dwell in you, he who raised our Lord Jeshu Meshiha from among the dead will also make alive your dead bodies, on account of his Spirit who dwelleth in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Now, my brethren, we are debtors, not to the flesh, that according to the flesh we should walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if after the flesh you live, you must die: but if, after the Spirit, the habitudes of the body you mortify, you live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For they who by the Spirit of Aloha are led, they are the sons of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For we have not received the spirit of servitude again unto fear, but we have received the Spirit of the adoption of sons, by whom we cry, Father, our Father!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>And the Spirit himself witnesseth with our spirit, that we are the sons of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if sons, heirs also; heirs of Aloha, and the sons of the inheritance of Jeshu Meshiha. For if we suffer with him, with him also shall we be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I consider that the sufferings of this time are not equal to that glory which is to be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the whole creation hopeth and waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation hath been subjected to vanity, not willingly, but on account of him who subjected her, upon the hope</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>that the creation herself also shall be made free from the servitude of corruption into the liberty of the glory of the sons of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that all creatures groan and travail until this day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>and not only they, but we also who have in us the first-fruit of the Spirit, groan within ourselves, and wait for the adoption, the redemption of our bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For in hope we live: but hope that is seen is not hope; for if we see it, why hope we for it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for that which is not seen, in patience we wait.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>So also the Spirit helpeth our infirmity: for what to pray for as we ought we know not; but the Spirit himself prayeth on our behalf in groanings unspoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But he who searcheth the hearts, he knoweth the mind of the Spirit, who, according to the will of Aloha, prayeth for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.28'>BUT we know that those who love Aloha, in every thing he helpeth them for good; them whom he set before that they might be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.29'>And from the first he knew them, and signified them in the likeness of the image of his Son, that he might be the first-born of many brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.30'>But whom he before signified, them he called; and whom he called, them he justified; and whom he justified, them he glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.31'>What then shall we say of these? If Aloha be for us, who is against us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>And if his Son be spared not, but for all of us delivered him up, how will he not with him give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who is against the chosen of Aloha? Aloha justifieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who condemneth? The Meshiha hath died and arisen, and is at the right hand of Aloha, and prayeth for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Meshiha? Affliction, or sorrow, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.36'>As it is written: For thee all the day long are we killed, We are reckoned as sheep for the slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.37'>But in these we all are victorious by the hand of him who hath loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.38'>For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor authorities, nor powers, nor things subsisting, nor things to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.39'>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, shall be able to separate me from the love of Aloha which is in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.1'>I say the truth in Meshiha, and lie not; my conscience witnesseth for me in the Spirit of Holiness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.2'>that I have great grief, and (that) the sorrow of my heart ceaseth not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.3'>For I could pray that I myself might be one accursed from Meshiha instead of my brethren and my kinsmen who are in the flesh;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.13'>as it is written, Jakub have I loved, and Isu have I hated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.14'>What then say we? Is there iniquity with Aloha? Not so:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>Perhaps thou wilt say, Of what then doth he complain; for who shall arise against his will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>Who then art thou, O man, who givest answer against Aloha? Will the mass say to him who formeth it, Why thus hast thou formed me?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>BUT if Aloha, willing to reveal his wrath, and to make known his power, in his much patience bore with the vessels of wrath who were perfected for destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>and poured his mercy upon the vessels of mercy who were prepared of Aloha for glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>who are we, (ourselves) the called, not only of the Jihudoyee, but also of the Gentiles:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>For why? Because it was not by faith, but by the works of the law: for they stumbled at the stone of stumbling;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>My brethren, (it is) the wish of my heart, and my prayer to Aloha concerning them, that they may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I testify of them that they have zeal for Aloha, but not in knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>But the righteousness of Aloha they know not, but seek the righteousness of themselves to establish, and on this account to the righteousness of Aloha they have not become subject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For the end of the law is the Meshiha unto righteousness in all who believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>FOR Musha thus describeth the righteousness which is of the law, that he who doeth these things shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness which is by faith thus speaketh, Say not in thy heart, Who shall ascend into heaven, And bring down the Meshiha?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>For the scripture saith, that every one who believeth in him shall not be ashamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>And in this he hath not distinguished nor the Jihudoya nor the Aramoya; for one is the Lord of them all, who is rich toward every one who calleth on him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>How then shall they invoke him in whom they have not believed? Or how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? Or how shall they hear without a preacher?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.14'>if I may provoke my fleshly kindred, and save some of them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>Well, they on account of unbelief were cut off, and thou by faith standest: be not exalted in thy mind, but fear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.13.1'>LET every soul to the powers of dominion be subject. For there is no power that is not from Aloha, and the powers that be, of Aloha are they instituted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.2'>Whoever then riseth up against the power, against the institution of Aloha he riseth; and they who arise against them will receive judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For judges are not a terror to the workers of good, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do good, and thou shalt have praise from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is the servant of Aloha, but to thee for good: and if thou do evil, fear; for not in vain is he girded with the sword; for he is the servant of Aloha, and the dispenser of wrath to them who do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>And because of this are we bound to be subject, not for the wrath only, but also because of conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>On this account also give we tribute to them; for they are the servants of Aloha over these things constituted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.7'>Render therefore to every man as is due to him: to whom tribute (is due,) tribute; and to whom custom, custom; and to whom reverence, reverence; and to whom honour, honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.8'>And to no man owe any thing, but one another to love. For whoever loveth his neighbour fulfilleth the law:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.9'>for that also which it hath said, Thou shalt not kill; and, Thou shalt not commit adultery; and, Thou shalt not steal; and, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, in this word it is accomplished, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.10'>Love unto his neighbour evil worketh not: therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.11'>AND also this know, that the time is, and the hour is, when we should be awake from our sleep; for now hath drawn nearer to us our salvation than when we believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.12'>The night now passeth away, and the day hath drawn nigh; put we away then from us the works of darkness, and let us clothe with the arms of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.13'>And as in the day, let us walk decorously, not with the song, nor with drunkenness, nor in the unclean chamber, nor in envy and in contention;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.3'>But let not him who eateth despise him who eateth not; and he who eateth not, let him not judge him who eateth; for Aloha hath received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.4'>Who art thou that judgest a servant who is not thine? who, if he stand, unto his Lord he standeth, and if he fall, falleth unto his Lord. But standing, he standeth; for there is power in the hands of his Lord to make him stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.5'>There is who distinguisheth day from day, and there is who judgeth all days (to be alike); but let every man in the conviction of his (own) mind be confirmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.6'>He who thinketh of the day, to his Lord he thinketh; and every one who thinketh not of the day, unto his Lord he thinketh not (of it). He who eateth, to his Lord he eateth, and to Aloha giveth thanks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.7'>and he who eateth not, to his Lord he eateth not, and giveth thanks to Aloha. For there is no one of us who to himself liveth and no one who to himself dieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.8'>For if we live, to our Lord we live; and if we die, to our Lord we die: and if we live, then, or if we die, our Lord's are we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.9'>Because of this also the Meshiha died and lived and arose, that he might be Lord of the dead and of the living. But thou, why dost thou judge thy brother?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.10'>Or thou, also, why despisest thou thy brother? For we shall all stand before the tribunal of the Meshiha:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.14.12'>Therefore, every one of us the answer for himself shall give unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.13'>Then judge not one another, but this determine rather, to lay not a stumbling-block for thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.14'>For I know, and am persuaded in the Lord Jeshu, that a thing which is unclean from itself is not (so); but to him who judgeth of any thing that it is polluted, to him only it is polluted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.15'>But if on account of meat thou grievest thy brother, thou walkest not in love: destroy not by thy meat him on account of whom the Meshiha died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.16'>Let not our good (things) be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.17'>For the kingdom of Aloha is not meat and drink, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.18'>For who in these things serveth the Meshiha pleaseth Aloha, and before men is approved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.19'>Now, after peace let us pursue, and after the edification of one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.20'>and not for the sake of meats undo the work of Aloha. For each thing is pure, yet evil is it to the man who eateth with offence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.21'>It is well not to eat flesh, nor to drink wine, nor any thing by which our brother is offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.14.22'>Hast thou confidence? In thyself retain it before Aloha. Blessed is he who condemneth not himself in what he distinguisheth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But this I speak as to the infirm; (and) not from commandment.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>But those who have wives I command, yet not I, but my Lord, that the wife from her husband separate not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>Yet, if she separate, let her remain without a man, or unto her husband be reconciled. And let not a man put away his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>But to the rest I say, not my Lord, If a brother hath a wife who is not a believer, and she be willing to dwell with him, let him not put her away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And any woman who has an husband unbelieving, and he willeth to dwell with her, let her not put away her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the man who believeth not is sanctified by the wife who believeth; and any wife who believeth not is sanctified by the husband who believeth; otherwise their children would be unclean; but now are they clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if he who believeth not separate, let him separate; a brother or a sister is not in servitude to these: unto peace Aloha hath called us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>But there is a distinction between the wife and the virgin.

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>But this for your own profit speak I; not to throw a snare over you, but that you may be constant towards your Lord in a comely manner, while not thoughtful of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if a man consider it to be dishonourable toward his virgin, who hath passed her time, that he hath not given her to the man, (and) that it is proper that he should give her; as he willeth let him act, he sinneth not: let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But he who hath firmly decided in his own mind, and nothing constraineth him, and (who hath) power in his will, and thus judgeth in his heart, that he will keep his virgin, doeth well.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>The wife, so long as her husband liveth, is bound by the law; but if her husband shall die, she is free, that she may do what she willeth, only in our Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>And if with a tongue any one speak, two shall speak, or at most three, and each shall (separately) speak, and one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>And if there be no one who interpreteth, let him who speaketh with a tongue be silent in the church, and between himself and Aloha let him speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let the prophets speak, two or three, and let the rest discern.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>And if to another be revealed while sitting, let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For one by one you can all prophesy, that each may learn, and each be edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>For the spirit of the prophets to the prophets is subject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>Because Aloha is not of tumult, but of peace, as in all the churches of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>LET your women in the church be silent; for it is not permitted to them to speak, but to be subject, as also saith the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>But if any wish to learn, in their houses let them ask their husbands; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Was it from you that the word of Aloha went forth? Or did it come only to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>But if any man of you think that he is a prophet, or that he is spiritual, let him acknowledge these which I write to you to be the commandments of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any man know not, let him not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Be emulous, therefore, my brethren, to prophesy, and to speak with tongues forbid not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>but let every thing be done with decency and in order.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>BUT I make known to you, my brethren, the gospel which I have announced to you, and you have received, and in which you stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>and by which you are saved; of which, the word I have preached to you, you are mindful, unless you have vainly believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you from the first, according as I had received: That the Meshiha died for our sins, as it is written;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that he was buried, and arose the third day, as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>And he was seen of Kipha, and after him, of the twelve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>and after them, he was seen of more than five hundred brethren together, many of whom survive till now, and some of them have slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>And afterward he was seen of Jakub, and after him of all the apostles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>but last of them all, as of an abortion, he was seen also of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>I am the least of the apostles, and am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of Aloha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>but by the grace of Aloha I am what I am; and his grace in me was not in vain; but more than all have I laboured, (yet) not I, but his grace which is with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>But if the Meshiha is proclaimed that he rose from the dead, how are there among you some who say that there is no life for the dead?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>But we are also found false witnesses of Aloha; for we have testified of Aloha that he hath raised the Meshiha, while he hath not raised (him).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead rise not, Meshiha also hath not risen</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>and if Meshiha hath not risen, your faith is made void and you are still in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>And already have they too who have slept in Meshiha perished.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>And as by man was death, so also by man is the life of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all men die, so also in the Meshiha are all made alive:</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>And then will be the end, when he delivereth the kingdom unto Aloha the Father; when he abolisheth every head, and all authority and all powers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>AWAKEN your hearts rightly, and sin not; for there are some who have not the knowledge of Aloha; to your shame I say it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>Some one of you will say, How arise the dead, and with what body come they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Fool, the seed which thou sowest, unless it die, lives not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>and that thing which thou sowest is not the body that is to be, but thou sowest naked grain, of wheat, or of barley, or of the rest of seeds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>but Aloha giveth it a body as he willeth, and to each of the seeds a body of its own nature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>For every body is not alike: for there is one body of man, and another of the beast, and another of the fowl, and another of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are heavenly bodies, and there are earthly bodies; but one is the glory of the heavenly, and another of the earthly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; and star excelleth star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the life of the dead. They are sown in corruption, they arise without corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>They are sown in baseness, they arise in glory. They are sown in weakness, they arise in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown an animal body, it ariseth a body spiritual. For there is a body of the animal, and there is a body of the spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>as also it is written, Adam the first man became a living soul, and the last Adam a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>But the spiritual was not first, but the animal; and then the spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man who is of the earth is dust, the second man the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As was he who was dust, so also are they who are dust: as is he who is from heaven, so also are the heavenly ones.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>But this I say, my brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven; nor doth corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you the mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we all shall be changed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>suddenly, as in the twinkling of the eye, at the last trumpet, while it calleth; and the dead will arise without corruption, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this which is corruptible shall put on incorruption, and likewise (this) which dieth shall put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>But when this which is corruptible shall put on incorruptibleness, and this which dieth, immortality, then shall be done that word which is written, Death is swallowed up in victory!</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to Aloha, who giveth us the victory by the hand of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Wherefore, my brethren, my beloved, be steadfast, be not moved, but be abounding in all time in the work of the Lord, while you know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>ON this account we have not weariness in this ministry which we have received, according to the mercies that are upon us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>But we have rejected the secrets of shamefulness; and walk not with craft, nor deal deceitfully (with) the word of Aloha; but by the revelation of the truth make we ourselves manifest to the minds of all men before Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But if our gospel is hid, to those who perish is it hid:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>(to) them whose minds the god of this world hath blinded because they believe not; lest the light of the gospel of the glory of Meshiha, who is the image of Aloha, should arise upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we preach not ourselves, but the Meshiha, Jeshu our Lord; but ourselves that we are your servants for the sake of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>For Aloha, who said, Let light arise from darkness, hath arisen in our hearts; that we should be illuminated by the knowledge of the glory of Aloha in the face of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>BUT we have this treasure in a vase of earth, that the greatness of the power might be from Aloha, and not from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>But in every thing we are afflicted, yet not strangled; we are beaten, yet not condemned;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, yet not forsaken; cast down, yet we perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>In all time the dying of Jeshu in our bodies we bear, that the life also of Jeshu might in our bodies be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For if we, the living, unto death are delivered on account of Jeshu, so also will the life of Jeshu be revealed in this our body of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>Now death in us worketh earnestly, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>We then also who have one spirit of faith, as it is written, I have believed, and therefore also spoken; we believe, therefore also we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>And we know that He who raised up our Lord Jeshu, will by Jeshu raise us also, and will present us with you unto himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For every thing is for your sake, that grace, abounding by many, may multiply praise to the glory of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>For this cause we have not weariness; for if our outward man is wasted, yet the interior man is renovated day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For the affliction of this time, while small and light, a glory without end for ever and ever prepareth for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>While we look not on these which are seen, but at those which are unseen. For the seen are of time, but the unseen are of eternity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>FOR we know that if our earthly house of this body were dissolved, we have nevertheless a building that is by Aloha; a house which is not made with hands, in the heaven, eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For concerning this also we groan, and long to put on our house which is from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if, when that we have clothed, we may not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For now while we are in this house, we groan from the weight of it: yet are we not willing to cast it off, but to be clothed upon of it, that its mortality might be swallowed up in life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>And he who prepareth us for this is Aloha, who hath given to us the earnest-pledge of his Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>For therefore do we know and are persuaded, that so long as we remain in the body we are in pilgrimage from our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>For by faith we walk, and not by sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>On this account we confide, and long to pass away from the body, and to be with our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>We give diligence, that whether we are pilgrims or inhabitants, we may be pleasing unto Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we are all to stand before the tribunal of the Meshiha, that every man may be recompensed in his body (for) that which is done in it, whether of good or of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>THEREFORE, because we know the terror of our Lord, we persuade men; and to Aloha we are manifest; but I hope that to your minds also we are manifest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>For we commend not ourselves again to you, but we give you cause to be boastful of us to them who in appearance boast, but not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we be beside ourselves, (it is) unto Aloha; and if we be right, (it is) unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of the Meshiha constraineth us, because we judge this, That if one for every man hath died, then (was) every man dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>And for every man he died, that they who live should not live to themselves, but to him who on their behalf died and arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>And henceforth we no man know according to the flesh; and if we have known the Meshiha according to the flesh, yet from now we know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Whoever therefore is in the Meshiha is a new creature; the old things have passed, and every thing hath become new</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>from Aloha, who hath reconciled us to himself in the Meshiha, and given to us the ministry of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>For Aloha is in the Meshiha, who hath reconciled the world with his greatness; and he hath not reckoned unto them their sins, and hath put in us the word of reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>WE are ambassadors then for the Meshiha, and as if Aloha himself besought you by us: instead of the Meshiha, therefore, we beseech, Be you reconciled unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For Him who knew not sin, on our account hath he made sin, that we might be in him the righteousness of Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>Nor in any thing give to any man occasion of stumbling, that no blemish may be upon our ministry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but in every thing will we demonstrate ourselves that we are the ministers of Aloha; by much patience, by afflictions, by necessity, by imprisonments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>by stripes, by chains, by tumults, by labour, by watching, by fasting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>by purity, by knowledge, by prolonging the mind, by benignity, by the Spirit of Holiness, by love without deceit,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>Or what union hath the temple of Aloha with (that) of demons? For you are the temple of Aloha the living; as it is written, I will dwell in them, and walk in them; And I will be their God, And they shall be to me a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Wherefore come out from among them, And be separate from them, (saith the Lord,) And the impure touch not; And I will receive you,</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Because then we have these promises, my beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all impurity of the flesh and of the spirit, and accomplish sanctification in the fear of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Bear with us, my brethren; we have wronged no man, we have corrupted no man, we have injured no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I speak not to your condemnation; for I have said already, that you are laid up in our hearts to die together and to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>GREAT is the freedom I have with you, and great in you is my glorying; I am full of consolation, and my joy greatly aboundeth in me in all my afflictions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>When, also, we had come into Makedunia, no repose had we for our body, but in every thing were we afflicted; without fighting, and within, fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>But Aloha, who consoleth the humble, consoled us by the coming of Titos;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not only by his coming, but also by his refreshment wherewith he had been refreshed among you. For he told us of your love toward us, and of your lamentation and your zeal on our behalf. And when I heard, my joy was great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>For though I grieved you in an epistle, I repent me not, though I did repent. For I perceive how that epistle, though for an hour, did make you sorry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>but now I exercise joy, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow hath brought you to repentance. For you were sorry towards Aloha; so that in nothing will you suffer loss from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For the sorrow that is for the sake of Aloha worketh soul-penitence, which turneth not and converteth, unto salvation; but the sorrow of the world worketh death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For, behold, (in) this very (case) that you were made contrite for the sake of Aloha; what carefulness it wrought in you, and vindication, and displeasure, and fear, and love, and zeal, and punishment! And by every thing have you shown yourselves to be pure in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>But, it was for this we wrote to you; not on account of the injurer, nor on account of the injured one, but that you may know before Aloha our carefulness over you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>For this cause we were consoled, and with our consolation more abundantly did we rejoice in the joy of Titos; because his spirit had been refreshed with you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>Because in whatever I had boasted to him concerning you, I have not been ashamed; but, as of every thing we had spoken truth with you, so also our boasting unto Titos hath been found in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affection is greatly enlarged toward you, when he remembers your obedience; because with fear and with trembling you received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>I rejoice that in every thing I can confide in you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>BUT we make known to you, my brethren, the grace of Aloha which hath been given to the churches of Makedunia;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>that in the great trial of their affliction there hath been an abounding of their joy; and the depth of their poverty hath been exceeded by the riches of their simplicity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For I testify, that according to their power, and more than their power, in the willingness of their soul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>they besought of us, with much supplication, that they might participate in the beneficence of the ministry for the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>And not as we had supposed, but they gave themselves up first to the Lord, and also to us by the will of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>For we would request of Titos, that as he had begun, so he would carry into accomplishment this beneficence among you also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But as you have excelled in every thing, in faith, and in doctrine, and in knowledge, and in all diligence, and in our love toward you, so also in this beneficence may you excel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>Not as though commanding I command you, but, from the diligence of your companions, the truth of your love would I put to the test.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>FOR you know the beneficence of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, that for your sake he became poor, though he was rich, that you through his poverty might be enriched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>But counselling I counsel you this which helpeth you; because from the last year you began not to will only, but also to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>But now accomplish in work that which you willed, that as there hath been an incitement to will, so accomplish it in work from what you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there be the will, according to what one hath, so is (he) accepted, and not according to what he hath not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>Neither must there be to others ease, and to you anxiety,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>but in equality be you at this time; that your abundance may be a supply to their want, that also their abundance may be for to your want, that there may be equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>As it is written, He who took up much had no superfluity, and he who took up little was not deficient.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But praise to Aloha who in-gave this solicitude for you to the heart of Titos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>For our request he accepted; and because he had great concern, of his own will he hath come forth among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>But we have sent with him our brother, whose praise in the gospel is in all the churches;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>who hath, moreover, been chosen by the churches to go forth with us with this bounty which is ministered by us to the glory of Aloha himself, and unto our cordiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>For we are precautious in this, that no one should lay upon us any imputation</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>with regard to this great bounty which is to be administered by us. For we are careful for the things which are comely, not only before Aloha, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>But we have also sent with them our brother, whom we have often proved in many to be diligent; but now still more diligent from the great confidence he hath concerning you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>Whether, then, (you regard) Titos, he is my companion and helper among you, or the other brethren, they are the apostles of the churches of the glory of Meshiha.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>BUT concerning the administration of the saints, I do more (than enough) if I write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>For I know the goodness of your mind, of which I boasted of you to the Makedunoyee, that Akaia was ready since last year, and your zeal hath stirred up many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>But I have sent the brethren to you, that our boasting which we boasted of you may not in this affair be vain; but, as I have said, you may be ready:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest, if the Makedunoyee should come with me, and find you not ready, we be shamed-that I may not say, you be shamed-of the boasting which we have boasted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>For this cause I have been careful to entreat of these brethren to go before to you, to make ready that blessing of which you have caused to be heard before; that it may be prepared, so as that it may be a blessing, not as avarice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this, He who soweth with scantiness, with scantiness also reapeth; and he who soweth with blessing, with blessing also shall reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Every man as he hath in his mind: not as of vexation or as of constraint; for a cheerful giver the Lord loveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>For it is in the power of Aloha to increase in you every good, that you may always have every thing sufficient, and that you may abound in every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>As it is written, He hath dispersed and given to the poor, And his righteousness standeth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>But may He who giveth seed to the sower and bread for food, himself give and multiply your seed, and increase the fruits of your righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>that in every thing you may be enriched in all simplicity, which worketh out through us, thanksgiving to Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>For, on account of the performance of this service, we not only supply the deficiency of the saints, but also cause many thanks givings to abound unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>For on account of the proof of this service we glorify Aloha, because you are subject to the confession of the gospel of Meshiha, and you have communicated in simplicity with them and with every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>And prayer they offer on your behalf in great love, on account of the greatness of the grace of Aloha which is upon you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For if we walk in the flesh, yet we war not according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the armour of our warfare is not of the flesh, but of the power of Aloha; and by it we cast down the strong-holds of rebels,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paulos, an apostle, not from men, nor by men, but by Jeshu the Meshiha, and Aloha his Father, who raised him from among the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches which are in Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace be with you and peace, from Aloha the Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from this evil world, according to the will of Aloha our Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom be glory to the age of ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I am amazed how soon you have been turned from the Meshiha himself, who called you by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>unto another gospel, which it is not; but there are men who disturb you, and (who) wish to remove you from the gospel of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But if we also, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you other than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As I have said before, and now again say to you, If any man preach to you other than what you have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For now do I persuade men, or Aloha? or do I seek to please men? For if until now I had pleased men, I should not have been the servant of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I make known to you, my brethren, that the gospel which is preached by me was not from man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>for neither from man had I received it and taught it, but by the revelation of Jeshu the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For you have heard of my former manners in Judaism, that I exceedingly persecuted the church of Aloha, and made it desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And I excelled in Judaism more than many of the sons of my years who were of my kindred, and was exceedingly zealous for the doctrine of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But, when He willed who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal his Son in me, that I should preach among the nations, immediately I did not disclose to flesh and to blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>neither went I to Urishlem, to the apostles who were before me, but I went into Arabia, and again returned unto Darmsuk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>And after three years I went unto Urishlem, that I might see Kipha, and I remained with him days fifteen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But others of the apostles I saw not, only Jakub, the brother of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>But these which I write to you, behold, before Aloha, that I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>And after these I went to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>Neither did the churches of Jihud which are in the Meshiha know me by face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>But this only they had heard, that he who had formerly persecuted us, behold, now preacheth he that faith which he beforetime had overthrown.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Again, from fourteen years I went up to Urishlem with Bar Naba, and took with me Titos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>But I went up by revelation; and I disclosed to them the gospel which I proclaim among the nations; and I showed it to those who were considered to be somewhat between myself and them, lest in vain I had run or should run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>Titos also who was with me, who was an Aramoya, was not constrained to be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>But on account of false brethren, who entered upon us that they might espy the liberty which we have in Jeshu Meshiha as that they might bring me into subjection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>yet not for the space of an hour did we cast ourselves down to be subject to them; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But, they who were considered to be somewhat,---but what they were I care not, for Aloha accepteth not men?s faces,---they themselves added nothing unto me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but otherwise: for seeing that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Kipha was intrusted with the circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>---for he who wrought effectually with Kipha for the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought effectually also with me for the apostleship of the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>---and knowing the grace which had been given to me, Jakub and Kipha and Juchanon, who were considered to be pillars, the right hand of fellowship gave to me and to Bar Naba, that we (should preach) among the Gentiles, and they among the circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>only (requiring) that of the poor we should be mindful; and I have been solicitous to do this same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Kipha had come to Antiokia, I rebuked him to his face, because they were offended by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For until certain men came from Jakub, he had eaten with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew himself and separated, because he was afraid of those who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the rest of the Jihudoyee also were thrown with him in this, so that Bar Naba also was led away by their partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>And when I saw that they were not walking rightly in the truth of the gospel, I said to Kipha in the presence of them all: If thou who art a Jihudoya live as an Aramoya and not Judaically, why forcest thou the Gentiles to live Judaically?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>If we who by our nature are Jihudoyee, and are not of the Gentile sinners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>because we know that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeshu Meshiha, also in him, in Jeshu Meshiha, have believed, that from the faith of the Meshiha we may be justified, and not from the works of the law; because from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>---If, while we seek to be justified through the Meshiha, we also ourselves are found sinners, is Jeshu Meshiha therefore the minister of sin? It cannot be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For, if those things which I destroyed I build again, I make it manifest of myself that I transgress the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I by the law to the law am dead, that unto Aloha I may live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>and with the Meshiha am I crucified, and from henceforth I live not, but in me liveth Meshiha; and this that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of Aloha, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not deny the grace of Aloha; for if righteousness is by the law, the Meshiha died in vain!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O deficient-minded Galatoyee, who bewildereth you? For, behold, as if depicted before your eyes, hath Jeshu the Meshiha been crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only would I know from you: Through the works of the law received you the Spirit, or through the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish that having begun in the Spirit you are now finishing in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>And all these have you borne in vain? But would it be in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>Then, he who imparted to you the Spirit, and wrought miracles among you, (did he so) through the works of the law, or through the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>As Abraham believed Aloha, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>know therefore that they who are of faith are the children of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>For Aloha who knew before that he would justify the Gentiles through faith, evangelized before unto Abraham; as saith the holy scripture: In thee all the nations shall be blessed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>therefore believers are blessed with Abraham the believer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For they who are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who doeth not all that is written in this law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that man is not justified by the law before Aloha, this maketh manifest: because it is written, The just by faith shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>But the law is not of faith: but he who doeth those things that are written in it shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>But us hath the Meshiha bought from the curse of the law, and hath been made a curse instead of us: for it is written, Accursed is every one who is hanged on the wood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>in order that upon the nations there might be the blessing of Abraham in Jeshu the Meshiha, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>My brethren, I speak as among men: That a covenant of man because confirmed no one rejecteth, or changeth in any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>But to Abraham was promised the promise, and to his seed. And he did not say to him, Unto thy seeds, as of many; but, To thy seed, as of one, him, (namely,) who is the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>But I say this, that the covenant which was confirmed before by Aloha, in the Meshiha, the law which was after, four hundred and thirty years, cannot nullify, nor (can it) abolish the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>But if the inheritance was by the law, it could not have been by the promise; but Aloha gave it unto Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Wherefore then was the law? It was added on account of transgression, until the Seed should come, he, of whom was the promise; and the law was given by angels into the hand of a Mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>But a Mediator is not of one; but Aloha is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law therefore against the promise of Aloha? Impossible: for if a law had been given which could make to live, certainly righteousness would have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture hath included all under sin, that the promise through faith of Jeshu Meshiha might be given to them who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But until (the dispensation of) faith came, the law kept us, as shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>The law therefore was our conductor to the Meshiha, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But faith being come, we are not under the conductor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all the children of Aloha through the faith of Jeshu the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For they who into the Meshiha are baptized have been clothed with the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>Jihudoya or Aramoya is not; the slave or the free is not; male or female is not; for you are all one in Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you are of the Meshiha, therefore are you the seed of Abraham, and heirs by the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>But I say that what time the heir is a child, he differeth not from a servant, though he be lord of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under curators and stewards until the time which his father appointeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So we also, while children, under the principles of the world were subjected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fulness of the time had come, Aloha sent his Son, and made from a woman, and made under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>that them who were under the law he might redeem, and we might receive the constitution of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, Aloha hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, who crieth, Father, our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>Therefore you are not servants, but sons; and if sons, heirs also of Aloha, through Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>For, while not knowing Aloha, you served them who by their nature are not gods:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>For you know that in infirmity of my flesh I preached to you at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And the temptation of my flesh you did not despise nor execrate; but as an angel of Aloha you received me, and as of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But she, Urishilem the high, is the free, who is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written, Be glad, O barren, who hast not borne; Exult and cry, thou who hast not travailed; Because multiplied are the sons of the desolate, More than the sons of the married wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>But we, my brethren, as Ishak, are the children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>And as then he who was born of the flesh persecuted him who was after the Spirit, so also now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>We therefore, my brethren, are not the children of the bondmaid, but the children of the free.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>lest any man deceive you with vain words; for because of these cometh the anger of Aloha upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Be not, therefore, participators with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For you were before darkness, but now you are light in our Lord. As the sons of light, then, so walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>For the fruits of the light are in all goodness and rectitude and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>And be discerning of that which is good before our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And have no communion with the works of darkness, which have no fruits, but reprove them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For that which in secrecy they do it is execrable even to mention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>For every thing is exposed by the light, and is revealed, and whatever revealeth is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Wherefore it is said, Awake thou who sleepest, And arise from the dead, And the Meshiha shall enlighten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See then that you walk vigilantly, not as fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>but as the wise who redeem their opportunity, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>On account of this, be not wanting in mind, but understand what is the will of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And be not drunk with wine, in which is intemperance, but be filled with the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>And discourse with yourselves with psalms and with hymns and with songs of the Spirit, singing with your hearts unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>And give thanks always on behalf of every man in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha unto Aloha the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>And be subject one to another in the love of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>WIVES, be subject to your husbands as to our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is the head of the wife, as the Meshiha is the head of the church, and he himself is the Saviour of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But as the church is subject to Meshiha, so also (should) wives be unto their husbands in every thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, as also the Meshiha loved his church, and gave himself for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>that he might sanctify her and purify her in the laver of waters and by the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>and that he might constitute her a church unto himself, being glorified, and not having blemish or wrinkle or any thing like these; but to be holy and spotless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So it becometh husbands to love their wives, as their own bodies. For he who his wife loveth, himself he loveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no man ever hated his own body, but nourisheth it, and taketh care of it; so also the Meshiha (taketh care) of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are members of his body, and of his flesh are we, and of his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>Because of this a man leaveth his father and his mother, and cleaveth unto his wife, and they two become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This mystery is great; but I speak of the Meshiha and of his church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless let every one of you so love his wife as his own self; but let the wife reverence her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.5'>And feel this in yourselves, which Jeshu the Meshiha (did) also:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.6'>who, when he was in the form of Aloha, considered this not to be robbery, (this, namely,) that he was the co-equal of Aloha:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.8'>and in fashion was found as a man, and humbled himself, and was obedient unto death, but the death of the cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.9'>Wherefore also Aloha greatly exalted him, and gave him a name that is more excellent than all names,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.10'>that at the name of Jeshu every knee should kneel, of those in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.13'>for Aloha himself effectuates in you also to will, also to do, the thing which you will.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.17'>But, also, offered on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad, and rejoice with you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.18'>so also you be glad and rejoice with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.19'>But I hope in our Lord Jeshu to send Timotheos to you soon, that I also may have quietness when I learn concerning you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.21'>For all are seeking what is theirs, and not what is of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.24'>And I confide on my Lord, that I also speedily shall come unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.25'>But now the matter hath pressed me to send to you the brother Epaphroditos, who is a helper and labourer with me, but your messenger and minister to my necessity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>for he desired to see you all, and was anxious, because he knew that you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>Yes, he was sick, unto death; but Aloha had mercy upon him; but not upon him only, but upon me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Urgently, therefore, have I sent him to you, that when you have seen him again you may rejoice, and that I may have a little breathing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.29'>Receive him, then, in the Lord with all joy; and those who are such, hold in estimation:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.30'>because for the work of the Meshiha he had come nigh unto death, and was disregardful of his life, that he might accomplish that which you had wanted in the service which concerned me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>I have not yet received, nor (am I) yet perfected; but I run, that so I may lay hold on that for the sake of which Jeshu the Meshiha hath laid hold on me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I stretch, and run towards the sign, to obtain the victory of the high vocation of Aloha by Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Let those, then, who are mature consider these things; and if otherwise you consider, this also will Aloha reveal to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.16'>Nevertheless, that to this we may attain, in one way let us proceed, and with one consent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.17'>Be like me, my brethren, and consider them who so walk according to the pattern you have seen in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For there are many who walk otherwise, of whom many times I have told you, but now weeping I tell you, they are adversaries of the cross of the Meshiha;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Col.1.2'>to those who are in Kulosos, the holy brethren and believers in Jeshu Meshiha: peace be with you, and grace from Aloha our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.3'>We give thanks to Aloha the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha in all time, and pray on your behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.4'>even from our hearing of your faith in Jeshu Meshiha, and of your love to all the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.5'>for the hope which is kept for you in heaven, which at the first you heard through the word of the truth of the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.6'>which is preached to you, as also to all the world, and increaseth and giveth fruits, as also in you from the day that you heard, and knew the grace of Aloha in truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.7'>as you learned from Epaphra our beloved companion, who is himself for you a faithful minister of the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.8'>and who hath made known to us your love, which is in the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.9'>ON account of this also we, from the day that we heard, have not ceased to pray for you, and to supplicate that you may be filled with the knowledge of the will of Aloha in all wisdom and in all spiritual understanding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.10'>and may walk according to that which is just, and may please Aloha in all good works, and may yield fruit, and increase in the knowledge of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.11'>and in all power be empowered according to the greatness of his glory in all patience and prolongedness of spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.12'>and with joy may give thanks to Aloha the Father, who hath fitted us for a portion of the inheritance of the saints in light,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.13'>and hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and brought us into the kingdom of his beloved Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.14'>in whom we have redemption and the forgiveness of sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.15'>who is the image of Aloha the unseen, and the first-born of all the creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.16'>And by him was every thing created that is in heaven and in earth; all that is seen, and all that is unseen, whether thrones or dominions, or princes or powers; all things by his hand and through him were created;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.17'>and he is before all, and every thing by him subsisteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.18'>And he is the head of the body of the church, (he) who is the chief and first-born from among the dead, that he should be preeminent in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.19'>For in him (the Father) hath willed all fulness to dwell;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.20'>and by him to reconcile all things to himself, and to make peace through the blood of his cross, (even) by him, whether they be inhabitants in earth or in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.21'>YOU also, who before were aliens and adversaries in your minds by your evil works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.22'>hath he reconciled now in the body of his flesh and through his death, to constitute you saints before him without spot and without blame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.23'>if you continue in your faith, your foundation being firm, and be not moved from the hope of the gospel which you have heard, and which is proclaimed to every creature who is under heaven, of which I, Paulos, am made a minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.24'>I rejoice in the sufferings which are on your account, and fulfil the void of the afflictions of the Meshiha in my flesh for the sake of his body,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.25'>which is the church; of which I am made a minister according to the dispensation of Aloha, which was given to me for you, to accomplish the word of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.26'>that mystery which was hidden from ages and generations, but now hath been revealed unto his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.27'>To whom Aloha hath willed to make known what is the opulence of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is, The Meshiha, who in you (is) the hope of glory;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.28'>whom we proclaim, and (concerning whom) we teach and inform every man in all wisdom, that we may present every man perfect in Jeshu Meshiha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.1.29'>for which also I labour and contend, according to the help of the power which is given to me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.2'>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.1'>But I wish you to know what an agony I have for you and for those who are in Laodikia, and for the rest who have not seen my person in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.2'>that their hearts may be comforted, and that they may approach in love to all the riches of assurance, and to the understanding of the knowledge of the mystery of Aloha the Father and of the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.3'>in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and of knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.4'>But this I say, Let no man deceive you with the persuasion of words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.5'>For though in the flesh I am far from you, yet in the spirit I am with you; and I rejoice to behold your order, and the firmness of your faith in the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.6'>As, then, you have received Jeshu Meshiha our Lord, (so) in him walk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.7'>your roots strengthened, and you builded in him, and established in that faith which you have learned, that you may abound therein with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.8'>Beware lest any man strip you by philosophy and by vain deceit, according to the teaching of men, and according to the principles of the world, and not according to the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.9'>in whom dwelleth all the fulness of the Godhead bodily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.10'>And in him also you are complete; for he is the head of all principalities and powers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.11'>And in him you have been circumcised with the circumcision which is not with hands, by the putting away of the flesh of sins, (even) by the circumcision of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.12'>And you have been buried with him by baptism, and in him have risen with him, who have believed in the power of Aloha who raised him from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.13'>And you who were dead in your sins, and in the uncircumcision of your flesh, he hath made alive with him, and forgiven us all our sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.14'>and hath blotted out in his mandates the writing of our debts that was against us, and hath taken it from the midst, and affixed it to his cross;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.15'>and by the yielding up of his body he hath prostrated principalities and powers, and hath shamed them openly by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.16'>LET no man therefore judge you in meat and in drink, or in the distinctions of festivals, and of new moons, and of shabeths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.17'>which are shadows of those to come, but the body is the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.18'>And lest any man wish by abasement of mind to fetter you to be subject to the worship of angels, intruding upon that which he hath not seen, and vainly inflated in his fleshly mind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.19'>and not holding the Head, from whom all the body is composed and constituted in joints and limbs, and increaseth (with) the increase of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.20'>For if you are dead with the Meshiha from the principles of the world, why as if you lived in the world are you judged? as that</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.21'>you are not to touch, nor to taste, nor to handle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.22'>For these are of perishable use, and are ordinances and doctrines of men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.2.23'>and appear to have in them a reason of wisdom, with the look of humility and the fear of Aloha, (as) not sparing the body, (yet) not in that which is (really) of value, but in those (things) whose use pertains to the flesh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Col.3'>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.1'>IF, then, you have risen with the Meshiha, seek (the realities) which are on high, where the Meshiha sitteth at the right hand of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.2'>Think of that which is on high, and not of that on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.3'>For you are dead, and your life is hid with the Meshiha in Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.4'>and when the Meshiha, who is our life, shall be manifested, then also will you be manifested with him in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.5'>Put to death, then, your members that are upon the earth: fornication, uncleanness, and passions, and evil desires, and covetousness, which itself is idolatry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.6'>For on account of these cometh the anger of Aloha upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.7'>In these also you walked aforetime, when you were conversant in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.8'>But now cease you from all these; anger, wrath, malice, reviling, impure speech:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.9'>and lie not one to another, but put off the old man with all his manners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.10'>and wear the new, who is renovated by knowledge in the image of his Creator,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.11'>where there is not Jihudoya and Aramoya, nor circumcision and uncircumcision, nor Javanoya and Barbaroya, nor slave and freeman, but the Meshiha is all and in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.12'>Wear, therefore, as the chosen of Aloha, saints and beloved, compassions and tenderness, and benignity, and lowliness of mind, and composure, and patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.13'>And bear with one another, and forgive one another, if any man have a complaint against his neighbour; even as the Meshiha hath forgiven you, so also forgive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.14'>and with all these charity, which is the girdle of perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.15'>And let the peace of the Meshiha direct your hearts, for to it you have been called in one body; and give thanks to the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.16'>whose word shall dwell in you abundantly, in all wisdom. And teach and admonish yourselves in psalms and in hymns and in songs of the Spirit, and with grace sing with your hearts unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.17'>And whatsoever you do, either in word or work, do (it) in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and with thanksgiving through him unto Aloha the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.18'>WIVES, be subject to your husbands, as it is right in the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.19'>Men, love your wives, and be not bitter against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.20'>Children, obey your parents in every thing, for so it is pleasing before our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.21'>Fathers, exasperate not your children, that they be not discouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.22'>Servants, obey in every thing your masters according to the flesh, not in the sight of the eye (only), as those who please men, but from a simple heart, and in the fear of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.23'>And all that you do, from all your heart do (it), as to our Lord, and not as to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.24'>And know that from our Lord you receive the reward in the inheritance; for the Lord the Meshiha you serve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.3.25'>But he who injureth is recompensed as he had injured, and there is no acceptance of persons.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Col.4'>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.1'>Masters, do equity and justice to your servants, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.2'>In prayer be constant, and be watchful in it, and (in) giving thanks;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.3'>praying also for us, that Aloha may open to us the gate of the word, to speak the mystery of the Meshiha, for the sake of which I am bound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.4'>that I may fully make it manifest, as it behoveth me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.5'>In wisdom walk towards the outward ones, and redeem your opportunity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.6'>And let your speech at all time be with grace as sprinkled with salt, each one knowing how it becometh him to return the answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.7'>What concerneth me will Tykikos, a beloved brother and faithful minister, and our companion in the Lord, make known to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.8'>whom I have sent to you for this, that he may know how it is with you, and may comfort your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.9'>with Onesimos, the faithful and beloved brother who is of you. These will make you know what concerneth us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.10'>Aristarchos, a captive with me, asketh for your peace, and Markos, the nephew of Bar Naba, regarding whom you are directed, that if he come to you, receive him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.11'>and Jeshu who is called Justos: these are of the circumcision, and these only have helped me in the kingdom of Aloha, and these have been a consolation to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Col.4.12'>Epaphra, who is of you, asketh for your peace; a servant of the Meshiha, who is always labouring on your behalf in prayer, that you may stand perfect and complete in all the will of Aloha.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.1'>PAULOS, and Sylvanos, and Timotheos, to the church of the Thesalonikoyee which (is) in Aloha the Father, and in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha. Grace be with you and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.2'>We give thanks to Aloha at all time for you all and are mindful of you in our prayers constantly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.3'>and remember before Aloha the Father the works of your faith, and the labour of your love, and the perseverance of your hope, which is in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.4'>For we know your election, my brethren, beloved of Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.5'>because our preaching was not in words only with you, but with power, and with the Spirit of Holiness, and with the persuasion of truth. Also you know how we were among you, on account of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.6'>and you became imitators of us and of our Lord, and you received the word in great affliction, and with the joy of the Spirit of Holiness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.7'>and became an example to all the believers who are in Makedunia and in Akaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.8'>For from you was made to be heard the word of our Lord, not only in Makedunia and in Akaia, but in every place your faith which is in Aloha was made to be heard, so that we have no need to say of you any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.9'>For they learned what an entrance we had unto you, and how you turned to Aloha, from the fear of idols, to worship Aloha the living and the true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.1.10'>awaiting his Son from heaven, Jeshu himself, whom he raised from among the dead, and who delivered us from the wrath that cometh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>And you know, my brethren, that our entrance unto you was not in vain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>but having suffered before and been shamefully treated, as you know, in Philipos, and then (even) in great conflict we spoke with you with the confidence of our God the gospel of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation was not from deceit, nor from uncleanness, nor from guile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but as approved of Aloha to be intrusted with his gospel, so speaking as not to please men, but Aloha who trieth our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For never have we used flattering speech, as you know, nor for an occasion of covetousness, Aloha witnesseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Neither have we sought glory from men, either from you or from others, though we could have been honoured ones, as the apostles of the Meshiha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>but we were humble among you, and, as a nurse who loveth her children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>so also we loved, and were desirous to impart to you, not only the gospel of Aloha, but also our life, because we loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>Remember, therefore, my brethren, how we laboured and toiled in the work of our hands by night and by day, that we might not be a burden on one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You witness and Aloha, how we preached to you the gospel of Aloha, purely and justly, and were without blame with all the faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>As you know how every one of you, as a father his children, we exhorted, and spoke with your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>and (now) we testify to you how you should walk worthy of Aloha himself who hath called you to his kingdom and to his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>WHEREFORE we also give thanks constantly unto Aloha, that the word of Aloha which you received from us, was not as the word of man (that) you received (it), but, as it is truly, the word of Aloha, which in operation worketh (alike) in you and in all them who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>But you, my brethren, have become like the churches of Aloha which are in Jihud, who are in Jeshu Meshiha, because you likewise suffer from your fellow-country-men, as they also from the Jihudoyee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who killed our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and the prophets who were of them, and ourselves have persecuted, and Aloha have not pleased,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>and have acted adversely to all men; who forbid us to speak with the Gentiles that they might be saved; to fill up their sins for all time: but upon them cometh the wrath unto the end!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>BUT we, my brethren, having been bereaved-ones of you the time of an hour, as to our presence, but not in our heart, have been the more solicitous to see your faces with great love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>and have wished to come to you (even) I, Paulos, one time and two; but Satana hindered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope and our joy, and the crown of our glorying, but you, before our Lord Jeshu at his coming?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>And because we could not endure, we were willing to be left at Athinos alone,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that none of you should be slain through these afflictions; for you know that to this we are set.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For while also we were with you, we foretold you that we were to be afflicted, as you know that it hath been.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>On account of this also, I, not enduring until I had sent to know your faith, lest the tempter should tempt you, and we should have laboured in vain;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>but now when Timotheos came to us from among you, and gave us intelligence of your faith and of your love, and that you have a good remembrance of us in every season, and desire to see us as we also (to see) you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>on this account we were comforted in you, my brethren, in all our anxieties and our afflictions because of your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>And now we live, if you are established in our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For what thanks giving can we render on account of you to Aloha, over all the joy with which we rejoice on your behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>unless before Aloha we supplicate exceedingly by night and by day to see your faces, and to perfect what is wanting to your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>But Aloha himself, the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, will make straight our way to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>and he will cause your love to increase to one another, and to every man, even as we love you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>and will establish your hearts without blame in holiness, before Aloha our Father, at the advent of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha with all his saints.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>HENCE then, my brethren, we pray of you, and beseech of you by our Lord Jeshu, that as you have received of us how it behoveth you to walk and to please Aloha, the more to increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know those precepts we gave to you in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is the will of Aloha, your sanctification; and that you be distant from all fornication;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>and not in the passions of concupiscence, as the rest of the Gentiles who know not Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>And that you dare not transgress, and defraud the one man his brother in this matter, because our Lord is the avenger of all these, as we have also before told you and testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For Aloha hath not called us to uncleanness, but unto sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore, whoever despiseth, not man he despiseth, but Aloha, who hath ingiven you his Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>But concerning the love of the brethren, you need not (that I) write to you; for you yourselves are taught of Aloha to love one another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>They also learn idleness, wandering from house to house; and not only idleness, but also to multiply words, and to follow vain (pursuits), and to speak things which they ought not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>In manifold portions and in all manners, spake Aloha with our fathers by the prophets from the first: but in these last days he hath spoken with us by his Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>whom he constituted the heir of every thing, and by whom he made the worlds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who himself is the resplendence of his glory, and the image of his Being, and upholdeth all (things) by the power of his word; and he, in his (own) person, hath made purification of sins, and hath sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>And this (person) is altogether more excellent than the angels, by so much as the name he hath inherited (is) more excellent than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For unto which one from (among) the angels at any time said Aloha, Thou art MY SON; I to-day have begotten thee? And again, I will be to him the Father, and he shall be to me the Son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>But again, when bringing in the First-begotten into the world, he said, Let all the angels of Aloha worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>But concerning the angels, thus hath he spoken: Who hath made his angels spirit, and his ministers a flaming fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But concerning the Son he hath said, Thy throne, Aloha, (is) for ever and ever, a right sceptre (is) the sceptre of thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou hast loved righteousness, and hast hated iniquity; therefore Aloha thy God hath anointed thee with the oil of exultation more (abundantly) than thy fellows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And again, Thou in the beginning hast laid the foundations of the earth, and the heavens are the work of thy hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They pass away, but thou art enduring; and all they as vestments shall become old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and as a garment thou shalt fold them up, they shall be changed; but thou (shalt be) as Thou Art, and thy years shall not fail</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which from (among) the angels hath he said at any time, Sit at my right hand, until I put thine adversaries a footstool beneath thy feet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are not all they spirits of ministration, who (are) sent forth in service on behalf of those who are hereafter to inherit salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>Therefore we are obligated to be more exceedingly heedful in what we have heard, that we fall not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word which was uttered by angels was confirmed, and every one who heard it, and transgressed against it, received a just retribution,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape if we despise those (words) which themselves are our salvation? Those which began by our Lord to be spoken, and by them who from him heard them in us were confirmed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>when Aloha witnessed concerning them by signs, and by miracles, and by various powers, and by distributed gifts of the Spirit of Holiness, that were bestowed according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For it was not to the angels he subjected the world which is future, of which we discourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But, as the scripture testifieth and saith, What is man, that thou rememberedst him, and the Son of man, that thou didst visit him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou didst humble him (to be) less than the angels; glory and honour hast thou placed upon his head, and hast empowered him over the work of thy hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>and every thing hast thou put in subjection under his feet. in this, that he subjected every thing to him, he hath left nothing which he hath not subjected. Yet hitherto we see not that every thing is subjected to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But him who was humbled to be less than the angels, we see to be JESHU himself, for the sake of the passion of his death; and glory and honour set upon his head; for He Aloha, in his grace, for every man hath tasted death!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was proper to him by whose hand are all, and on account of whom all are, (and who) would lead many sons to his glory, that the Prince of their salvation by sufferings should be perfected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For he who sanctified, and they who are sanctified, are all from one: wherefore he has not been ashamed to call them his brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>(As) when he saith, I will announce thy name unto my brethren, and in the midst of the church I will praise thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again, I will put my confidence in him. And again, Behold me, and the sons whom thou hast given me, Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Forasmuch as the sons have been made to participate in flesh and blood, he also likewise was made a partaker of these very things; that by his death he might abolish him who held the power of death, who is Satana,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and set loose them who in the fear of death had been all their lives subjected to servitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For not from the angels he took, but from the seed of Abraham he took.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore it was right that in every thing he should be rendered like unto his brethren, that he might be compassionate, and a High Priest faithful in to Aloha, and become an expiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in this, that he hath suffered and been tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Wherefore, my holy brethren, who have been called with the calling that from heaven, contemplate this Apostle and High Priest of our confession, JESHU MESHIHA!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who was faithful to him who made him, as (was) Musha in all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For greater is the glory of this (One) by far than (the glory) of Musha, even as the honour of him who built the house is far greater than his building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house by some man is builded; but He who built all is Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Musha, as a servant, was faithful in all his house, for the testimony of those that were to be announced him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but the Meshiha as THE SON over his house: and his house are we, if, unto the end, we shall hold fast our confidence, and the triumph of his hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore the Spirit of Holiness hath said, to-day if ye will hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>harden not your hearts unto the angering of him, as (did) the embitterers, and as the day of temptation in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>when your fathers tempted me, and proved (and) saw my works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>On which account I was wearied with that generation; and said, It is a people that doth err (in) their heart, and that hath not known my ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So that I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Beware, therefore, my brethren, lest there be in any man among you an evil heart which believeth not, and ye depart from Aloha the living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>But examine yourselves all the days, until the day which is called THAT DAY, lest any one of you be hardened by the deceptiveness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we are made participators with the Meshiha, if, from the beginning and unto the end, in this very standing we steadfastly persist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>As that it is said, To-day, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts to provoke him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For who are they who heard and provoked him? Not all they who came out of Metsreen by the hand of Musha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was he wearied forty years, but with them who sinned, and whose bones fell in the desert?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And of whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, but of them who would not be persuaded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And we see that they were not able to enter in, because they did not believe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Let us fear, therefore, lest, while there is a confirmed promise of an entrance into his rest, any one shall be found among you remaining from entering in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For we have been evangelized as well as they: but the word which they heard did not profit them, because not contempered with faith in them who heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>But we enter into the rest, we (being of) those (who) have believed. But as He hath said, So I sware in my wrath, that they should not enter into my rest: for, behold, the works of Aloha from the beginning of the world were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>As he said concerning the shabath, God rested on the seventh day from all his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>Yet here again he saith, They shall not enter into my rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Therefore, because there was a place into which every one of them might have entered, and they who had it announced first did not enter in, forasmuch as they would not be persuaded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>---moreover, (as) another day he appointeth, after much time; as above it is written, that David hath said, To-day if his voice ye will hear, harden not your hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>---but if Jeshu-bar-Nun had established them in rest, he not have spoken afterwards of another day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>---Therefore, yet to enjoy a shabathism is confirmed to the people of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he who is entered into his rest hath also reposed himself from his works, as Aloha (did) from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us, therefore, anxiously endeavour to enter into that rest, that we fall not after the manner of those who were not persuaded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For living is the Word of Aloha, and all-acting, and more penetrating than a two-edged sword, and entereth to the separation of the soul and the spirit, and of the joints, and of the marrow, and the bones, and discerneth the reasonings and counsel of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>Neither is there any creature that is concealed from before him; but every thing (is) naked and manifest before his eyes, to whom they shall give account .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Therefore having such a great High Priest, Jeshu Meshiha, the Son of Aloha, who hath ascended to heaven, let us persevere in the confession of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we have not an high priest who cannot suffer along with our infirmity, but (one) who, tempted in every thing as we, (was) separate from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Let us therefore approach with confidence to the throne of his grace, that we may receive mercy, and find grace for help in the time of affliction.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest who is from among men, on the behalf of men, standeth over those things which are of Aloha, to offer oblation and sacrifices for sins:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>and (is one) who can humble himself, and suffer with those who know not and err, since he also himself with infirmity is clothed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>And on this account he is obligated as on the behalf of the people, so (also) for himself, to offer up for his sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>Yet no man to himself taketh the honour, but he who is called by Aloha, as of Aharun .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>Thus also the Meshiha glorified not himself to be a High Priest; but He who said to him, Thou art my Son, I to-day have begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>So, too, in another place he saith, Thou art the Priest for ever, after the likeness of Malki-Zedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>When also with flesh he had been clothed, prayer and supplication, with a powerful cry, and with tears, he offered up unto Him who was able from death to revive him, and was heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>And though he was the Son, yet from the fear and the sufferings which he sustained he learned obedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>And so was he perfected, and became unto all them who obey him the Cause of eternal salvation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>and was named by God, The High Priest after the likeness of Malki-Zedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>But concerning this Malki-Zedek himself, we have much discourse to utter, and hard to explain, because ye are infirm in your hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For ye ought to be teachers, on account of the time by you in learning; but now ye have need again to be taught those which are the first scriptures of the beginningwords of Aloha; and need have ye for milk, and not for solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>But every one whose food is milk is not versed in the doctrine of righteousness, because he is a babe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But for the perfect is solid food; those, (namely,) who, because exercised, have trained their senses to distinguish the good and the evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Wherefore let us leave the beginning of the word of the Meshiha, and let us come unto perfection. Or why again another foundation lay you for repentance from dead works, and for faith which is in Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>and for the doctrine of ablution and of imposition of the hand, and for the resurrection from the place of the dead, and for the judgment which is eternal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>If the Lord permit, we will do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>But they who once unto baptism have descended, and have tasted the gift which is from heaven, and have received the Spirit of Holiness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good word of Aloha, and the power of the world to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>(and) who again shall sin, cannot again be renewed unto conversion, who would afresh crucify and put to shame the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the earth that hath drunk the rain which hath come upon it many times, and shall have brought forth the herb that is useful for them on whose account it is cultured, receiveth blessing from Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but that which shall produce thorns and briers hath reprobation; nor is it far from the curse, but its end is burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But we are persuaded concerning you, my brethren, those things which are good, and that draw nigh unto salvation, though thus we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For not unrighteous is Aloha, that he should forget your works and your charity which ye have manifested in his name, who have ministered unto the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we desire that every one of you manifest the same diligence for the full completion of your hope until the end;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>and that it be not cut off from you, but that ye be imitators of them who by fidelity and patience have become heirs of the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when to Abraham Aloha gave promise, because there was no one greater than himself to swear by, he sware by his own Self,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>and said, Blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so he waited patiently, and obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men swear by one greater than themselves: and every controversy which occurs among them hath a sure conclusion in the oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>On this account Aloha, willing abundantly to manifest to the heirs of the promise that his engagement is changeless, hath bound it in an oath:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>that by two things that are not changed, in which it cannot be that Aloha should lie, great consolation should be ours who have fled unto him: and that we may retain the hope that is promised to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which we have as an anchor that holdeth our soul, that it may not be moved, and entereth within the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jeshu hath first entered for us, and become the Priest for ever in the likeness of MALKI-ZEDEK.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Malki-Zedek is king of Sholim, the priest of Aloha the Most High. And he (it was who) met Abraham when he returned from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>And to him Abraham separated the tenth from every thing which he had with him. Now his name, being expounded, (is,) the King of Righteousness; and again, MalekSholem, which is, King of peace:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>whose father and mother were not written in the genealogies; neither the beginning of his days, nor the conclusion of his life; but in the likeness (of that) of THE SON OF ALOHA standeth his priesthood for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>But see how great this (person was,) that Abraham, head of the fathers, gave to him the tenths and the choicest things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>For they of the sons of Levi who have received the priesthood, have a commandment of the law to receive tenths from the people, they from their brethren, they also from the loins of Abraham having sprung.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But he who is not written in their genealogies took tithes from ABRAHAM, and blessed him who had received the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>But, without controversy, he who is less is blessed by one who is Greater than himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here the sons of men who die receive the tithes; but there he concerning whom the scripture testifieth that he liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>And as one may say, by the hand of Abraham, even Levi, he who taketh tithes, himself also is tithed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>For he was yet in the loins of his father when he met Malki-Zedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>If, therefore, Perfection were to be through the priesthood of the Levoyee, by which the law has been put upon the people, why was there another Priest required, who should arise in the resemblance of Malki-Zedek? For he had said, In the likeness of Aharun he shall be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>But as a change hath been made in the priesthood, so is there also a change made in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For he concerning whom these things are said was born from another tribe, from which no man hath ministered at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is manifest that from Jihuda arose our Lord, from the tribe of whom Musha hath said nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And again: it is more fully known by that which hath said, In the likeness of MalkiZedek ariseth another Priest;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who was made not by the law of bodily commandments, but in the power of a life which is indissoluble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For he testifieth concerning him, Thou art a Priest for evermore according to the likeness of Malki-Zedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>But the change which was made in the first institution was on account of its powerlessness, and because profit was not in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>For the law perfected nothing: but instead of it a hope has entered which is more excellent, (and) by which we are brought nigh unto Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And he hath confirmed it unto us in an oath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>For they were made priests without an oath; but this with an oath: as he said unto him by the hand of David, The Lord hath sworn and will not lie, that thou art the Priest for ever in the likeness of Malki-Zedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>In all this more excellent is the covenant of (which) Jeshu is the sponsor .</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>There were (moreover) many priests, because they were dying, and were not permitted to remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But because this (one) standeth for ever, his priesthood passeth not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>And he is able to save for eternity them who approach by him unto Aloha; for he liveth through all time, and offereth up prayers on their behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such an High Priest as this was adequate for us; pure, and without evil, and without spot; who was separate from sins, and exalted higher than heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>With him there was no necessity daily, like the chief of the priests, that first for his own sins he should offer sacrifices, and then on behalf of the people: for this he did once when in himself he offered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law constituted infirm men priests; but the word of the oath, which was subsequent to the law, (hath constituted) THE SON perfect for evermore.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>But the sum of them all (is)---We have a High Priest who hath sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>and who hath become a Minister of the holy place, and of the true tabernacle, which Aloha hath framed, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>And every high priest is appointed to offer oblations and victims: hence it was right that this one should also have that which he might offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>But were he upon the earth, he would not be a priest, because there were priests who offered oblations as by the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>they, (namely,) who minister at an emblem and shadow of those (things) that are in heaven. As it was said unto Musha when he made the tabernacle, See and make every thing according to the pattern which was showed to thee in the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now a ministry which is better than that hath Jeshu Meshiha received, by so much as that covenant of which he is made the Mediator is better, and was given with better promises, than that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if the first covenant had been faultless, no place had there been for this second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For reprehending them he saith, Behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord, and I will complete with the family of the house of Israel, and with the family of the house of Jihuda,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>THE NEW COVENANT: not as was that covenant which I gave to their fathers in the day that I took them by their hand, and led them from the land of Metsreen; because they did not persevere in my covenant, therefore I have neglected them, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>But this is the covenant that I will give to the family of the house of Israel after these days, saith the Lord: I will in-give my law in their minds, and upon their hearts will I inscribe it; and I will be to them, even I, Aloha, and they shall be unto me the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>and no man shall (have need to) teach the son of his city, nor his brother, and say, Know the Lord; because all shall know me, from the least of them to the eldest of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>And I will purify them from their unrighteousness, and their sins again will I not remember unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In that he said, THE NEW, he hath made the former old: and that which is antiquated, and hath grown old, is nigh unto decay.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>But in the first there were ordinances of ministry, and a worldly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For in the first tabernacle that was made there were the candelabrum, and the table, and the presencebread; and this was called the Holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>But the interior tabernacle, that was within the second veil, was called the Holy of Holies:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>in it were the incense-vessel of gold, and the ark of the covenant, which was altogether covered with gold; and within it were the golden urn, in which was the manna, and the rod of Aharun that budded, and the tablets of the covenant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and above this the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy-seat. But time there is not to speak upon every one of these which were thus ordained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now, into the outer sanctuary at all times entered the priests, and fulfilled their offices;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the tabernacle which was within, one day in the year, alone, entered the high priest, with that blood which he offered for himself and the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>By this the Spirit of Holiness made known that the way of the holies was not yet manifested, so long as was the standing of the first tabernacle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>And this was a figurative representation for the time in which oblations and victims have been offered;-those which have not been able to perfect the consciousness of him who offered them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>but (have consisted) in meat and drink only, and in various kinds of baptism, being institutions of the flesh appointed until the time of setting right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But the Meshiha who hath come was a High Priest of good things which he wrought out, and hath entered into the great and perfect tabernacle (which was) not made with hands, nor made from these creatures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Nor entered he with the blood of goats and calves, but with the blood of himself he entered once the holy place, and hath found eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and of calves, and the dust of an heifer, sprinkled upon those who were unclean, sanctifieth them for the purification of their flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more then shall the blood of the Meshiha, who, by the Eternal Spirit, himself hath offered without spot unto Aloha, purify our conscience from dead works, to serve the Aloha the Living?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>For this was he made the Mediator of the new covenant, that by his death he might become the ransom for those who had transgressed against the first covenant, (and) that they might receive the promise, they, who are called unto the inheritance which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where a covenant is, there is indicated the DEATH of that which made it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For upon death only is it confirmed; because while he who made it lived there is no value in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Wherefore neither the first without blood was confirmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when every precept had been enjoined by Musha to the whole people according to the law, Musha took the blood of the heifer, and water, with the scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled upon the books and upon all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>and said to them, This is the blood of that covenant which is commanded by Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>Also upon the tabernacle and upon all the vessels of the service from it with blood he sprinkled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>Because every thing with blood was purified under the law; and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>For it was necessary that these which are a type of the heavenlies, with (these) things should be purified; but the heavenlies themselves with sacrifices that are more excellent than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For not into the sanctuary made with hands hath the Meshiha entered, which is an emblem of the true one, but into heaven itself hath he entered, that he might appear before the face of Aloha for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor that he should offer himself many times, as did the chief of the priests, entering every year into the holy place with blood not his own;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>otherwise he would have been obligated many times to suffer from the beginning of the world. But now, in the end of the world, once hath he offered himself, that by his sacrifice he might abolish sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And as it is ordained to the sons of men, that they must once die, and after their death the judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so also the Meshiha was once offered, and in his (own) person sacrificed (for) the sins of many; but the second time without sins he appeareth for the salvation of them who expect him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For there was in the law the shadow of good things to come, not the subsistence of the very things, therefore (though) every year the same sacrifices were offered they could never perfect those who offered them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>For if they had perfected, they would have ceased afterward from the presentation of them; because the conscience of those who had been once purified by them would not henceforth have been troubled by (such) sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in those sacrifices their sins are brought to remembrance every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and of goats to purify (from) sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith, Sacrifices and oblations thou hast not willed, but with a body hast thou clothed me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>and entire burnt-offerings for sins thou hast not required.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then said I, Behold, I come; in the sum of the books it is written concerning me, that I shall do thy will, Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Above he said, Victims, and oblations, and entire burnt-offerings for sin thou hast not willed; those which are offered in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>And afterwards he said, Behold, I come, that I may do thy will, Aloha. In this he hath done away with the first, that he may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>For by this his will we are sanctified by the offering of the body of Jeshu Meshiha, which was once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>For every high priest who stood and ministered every day, offered the same sacrifices, which can never purify (from) sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But this one sacrifice hath offered for sins, and hath sat down at the right hand of Aloha for ever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>waiting from henceforth until his adversaries are set as a footstool beneath his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering he hath perfected those who are sanctified through him for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>Now the witness unto us is the Spirit of Holiness, when he saith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>This is the covenant that I will give to them from after those days, saith the Lord: I will give my law in their minds, and upon their hearts will I inscribe it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>and their iniquity and their sins I will not remember against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>BUT WHERE THERE IS REMISSION OF SINS, THERE IS NOT REQUIRED AN OFFERING FOR SINS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>We have, therefore, my brethren, confidence to enter the holy place through the blood of Jeshu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>and a way of life which he hath now made new to us through the veil, which is his flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and we have the High Priest over the house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>Let us, therefore, draw near with a confirmed heart, and the full security of faith, with our hearts sprinkled and cleansed from an evil conscience, and our body washed with pure waters;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>and let us persevere in the confession of our hope, and not swerve; for faithful is He who hath promised us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us consider one another with incitement to charity and good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>And let us not forsake our congregation, as is the custom with some; but pray one with another; (and) so much the more as ye see that day to be approaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if with his will any man shall sin after he hath received the knowledge of the truth, there is not still a victim to be offered for sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a fearful judgment to come, and burning fire which devoureth the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>For if he who transgressed the law of Musha, upon the mouth of two or three witnesses, without mercy died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>how much greater punishment, think ye, shall he receive who hath trampled upon the Son of Aloha, and hath counted the blood of the covenant of him by which he had been sanctified as that of every man and hath insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>We know him who hath said, Retribution is mine, and I will repay: and again, The Lord shall judge his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>How terrible to fall into the hands of Aloha the Living!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>Be mindful, therefore, of the first days, those in which ye received baptism; and when ye sustained a great agony of sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>with ignominy and affliction; and when ye were made gazing-stocks, and were associated with men who also endured these (things).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>And it afflicted you on account of them who were bound; and the pillage of your goods with joy ye sustained, as knowing that ye have a possession in heaven, which is better, and passeth not away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Destroy not, therefore, the confidence which you have, for which there is a great reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>But patience is needed by you, that ye may do the will of Aloha, and receive the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>Because (yet) a little time, and a very little, and He who cometh shall come, and not be slow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>But the just by the faith of me shall live; but if he become weary, my soul delighteth not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of the weariness which bringeth to perdition, but of the faith which maketh us to possess our soul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now FAITH is the persuasion concerning things which are in hope, as if they were in reality, and a revelation of those which are not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>And for this was the testimony concerning the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>For by faith we perceive that the worlds were ordained by the word of Aloha, and (how) these (things) which are seen were from those which are not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Habel offered a sacrifice which was far better than that of Koen unto Aloha; and because of it there is respecting him a testimony that he was righteous; and Aloha gave witness concerning his oblation; and on account thereof also while dead he is speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>Through faith Hanak was translated, and did not taste death; nor was he found, because Aloha had translated him: for before that he would translate him, there was respecting him the testimony that he pleased Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith it is not possible for man to please Aloha; for he who draweth near unto Aloha must believe that he is, and that of those who seek him he will be the rewarder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Nuch, when spoken with upon those things which had not been seen, feared, and made him the ark for the salvation of his family; by which he condemned the world, and was an heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham, when he was called, heard that he was to go forth to a place which he should receive for an inheritance; and he went out, while he knew not whither he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he was a sojourner in the land that was promised to him, as in an alien state, and dwelt in tabernacles with Ishok and Jakub, sons of the inheritance which was his by the promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>for he was expecting the city which hath foundations, whose builder and maker is Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith Saro, who was barren, received strength to conceive seed, and, which (thing) was not in the time of her years, gave birth (to a son); because she was sure that he who had promised to her was faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Therefore from one who had failed from old age, were there begotten multitudes as the stars of heaven, and as the sand upon the shores of the sea, which have no number.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>In faith died these all, not having gotten their promise, but from afar had beheld it, and exulted in it, and confessed that strangers they were, and sojourners in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For they who these things say, make manifest that their city they are seeking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>But if that city from which they had gone out they desired, they had opportunity to return and go to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But now it is known that a better (one) than that they desired; that (namely) which is in heaven. Wherefore Aloha was not ashamed their God to be called; for he hath prepared for them a city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham offered Ishok in his temptation and his only-born he lifted upon the altar, even him whom he had received by the promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.18'>for it had been said to him, In Ishok shall be called to thee the seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'>For he thought within himself, that Aloha could even from the dead upraise: and on account of this in a similitude he was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>By faith in that which was to come, Ishok blessed Jakub and Isu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>By faith, when dying, Jakub blessed each of the sons of Jauseph; and worshipped upon the head of his staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>By faith Jauseph, when dying, was mindful of the going forth of the sons of Israel, and commanded concerning his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>By faith the parents of Musha concealed him when he had been born three months, because they saw that he was a beautiful child; and they feared not the edict of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>By faith Musha, when he became a man, refused to be called the son of the daughter of Pherun;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>and chose to himself to be in affliction with the people of Aloha, and not for a little time to delight (himself) in sin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>and considered the riches of the reproach of Meshiha to be far greater than the treasures of Metsreen: for he contemplated the recompence of the reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he forsook Metsreen, and feared not the wrath of the king; and hoped, as one who beheld Aloha who is the invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith they performed the passover, and the sprinkling of the blood, that he might not come near,-he, who was destroying the first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>By faith they traversed the sea of Sooph, as those who (march) upon dry land; but the Metsroyee were swallowed up in it, when they had dared to enter it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.30'>By faith the ramparts of Jirichu fell down, after they had been encompassed seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.31'>By faith Rachob the harlot perished not with those who would not hearken, because she had received the explorers in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.32'>What shall I yet say? For (too) brief is the time for me to tell of Gedhun, and of Borok, and of Shemshun, and of Nephtoch, and of David, and of Shomuel, and of the rest of the prophets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.33'>they who through faith conquered kingdoms, and wrought righteousness, and received promises, and shut the mouths of lions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>and quenched the powers of fire, and were delivered from the edge of the sword, and were made strong from infirmities, and became valiant in battle, and overthrew the camps of the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>And they gave unto women their sons by the resurrection of the dead; and others in torments died, nor hoped to be delivered, that the better resurrection they might have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'>But others went through mockings and scourgings; others unto chains and imprisonments were given up,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jas.2.5'>Listen, my beloved brethren: Hath not Aloha chosen the poor of the world, but rich in faith, to be heirs in that kingdom which Aloha hath promised to them who love him?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>those who before were disobedient in the days of Nuch; while the long-suffering of Aloha commanded that he should make the ark, upon the hope of their conversion, and eight souls only entered therein, and were saved in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>After which very type also you are saved in baptism, not while you cleanse the body from filth, but while you make confession of 6 Aloha with a pure conscience, and of the resurrection of Jeshu Meshiha;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For the time which hath passed sufficeth to have served the will of the Gentiles in indulgence, in drunkenness, in vileness, in revellings, and in the service of demons.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and on the former world was not lenient, but Nuch, who was the eighth preacher of righteousness, he preserved, when the deluge came upon the world of the wicked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>the cities of Sadum and of Omuro he burned, and with overthrow condemned them, while an example to the wicked who should be he set them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>also Lut the righteous, who was bruised with the impure conversation of the lawless, he delivered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>-for in sight and in hearing, while (that) just (man) dwelt among them, from day to day, his righteous soul by their lawless works was tortured;-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>the Lord knoweth how to deliver from affliction them who fear him, but the evil unto the day of judgment to be tormented will he reserve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>But most those who after the flesh follow the concupiscence of impurity, and of authority are contemptuous; daring and arrogant, (and) who by greatness are not moved while they blaspheme:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas angels, who in power and strength are (so much) greater than they, bring not against them a judgment of blasphemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, as the dumb animals, by nature (ordained) to the knife and to destruction, blaspheming what they know not, in their own destruction will be destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>while they in whom is iniquity the wages of iniquity shall receive. They repute as pleasure the luxury which is in the day. Blemishes (are they), full of spots, who delighting in their refreshments are luxurious:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of adultery, and sins which cease not, alluring souls that are not established. An heart have they which is disciplined in covetousness; sons of malediction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>who, forsaking the straight way, have erred, and gone in the way of Belam bar Beur, who the wages of iniquity loved. But he had reproof of his transgression;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>(for) the dumb ass which spake with the voice of man rebuked the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are wells without water, clouds driven from above, unto whom the blackness of darkness is reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For while they speak scoffing words of vanity, they allure with impure desires of the flesh those who almost escaped from them who have their conversation in error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>And liberty to them they promise, while they (themselves) are the servants of corruption; for the thing by which a man is overcome, to that he is subject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if they have escaped from the pollutions of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeshu Meshiha, with those very things entangled they are again over-come, their end becomes worse than the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it had been more tolerable for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than, when they knew, to turn backward from the holy commandment delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>But it hath happened to them according to the true proverb, that The dog hath turned unto his vomit; the sow which had washed into the wallow of the mire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>Now this, my beloved, the second epistle I write to you; in both of which I awaken to remembrance your fair mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>That you may remember the words which were before spoken by the holy prophets, and the commandments of our Lord and our Saviour (delivered) by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>This first know you, that there will come in the last of the days deriders who will deride, as after their own lusts they walk,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, Where is the promise of his advent? for, since our fathers have slept, every thing (abideth) as from the beginning of the creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>Unknown to them is this while they are willing, that the heaven was from of old, and the earth from the waters and through the waters subsisted, by the word of Aloha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>those (waters) by which the world that then was, again (was covered) with waters, and perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>But the heaven which is now, and the earth, by his own word are set, being reserved unto fire, unto the day of judgment and the perdition of wicked men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But this one (truth) be not ignorant of, my beloved, That one day with the Lord (is) as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>Not dilatory is the Lord in his promises, as some consider delay; but is patient on your account, not willing that any man should perish, but (that) every man to repentance should come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord cometh as a thief: that (day) in which the heavens suddenly shall pass away, but the elements burning be dissolved, and the earth and the works that are in it be found not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>As, therefore, all these are to be dissolved, how behoveth it you to be holy in your conversation, and in the fear of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>expecting and desiring the coming of the day of Aloha; that (day) in which the heavens, tried with fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements burning shall melt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But new heavens and earth, according to his promise, we expect; those wherein righteousness dwelleth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Wherefore, my beloved, while these you expect, be diligent, that, without blemish and without spot, of Him you may be found in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And the long-suffering of the Lord consider (to be for) salvation; as also our beloved brother Paulos according to the wisdom which hath been given to him hath written to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>As in all his epistles he speaks concerning these; in which there is somewhat difficult for intelligence. Those who are not knowing nor settled pervert them, as also the remaining scriptures, to their perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>You therefore, my beloved, knowing this before, keep yourselves, lest, going after the error of those who are lawless, you fall from your support.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But increase in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and our Saviour Jeshu Meshiha, and (of) Aloha the Father, Whose be glory both now, and in all time, and to the days eternal. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.1.2'>And the life was manifested, and we have seen, and testify, and preach to you the eternal life which was with the Father, and was manifested to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.3'>And what we have seen and heard, we make known also to you, that you may have communion with us; and our communion is with the Father, and with his Son Jeshu the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.4'>And these write we unto you, that our joy which is in you may be complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.5'>And this is the annunciation which we have heard from him, and announce to you, that Aloha is light, and in him is no darkness at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.6'>And if we say that we have communion with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and in the truth do not proceed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.7'>but if in the light we walk, as He is in the light, we have communion with one another, and the blood of Jeshu his Son cleanseth us from all our sins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.1.9'>but if we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.1.10'>And if we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My sons, these write I to you, that you sin not. And if a man shall sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jeshu Meshiha, the Just;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>for he is the propitiation for our sins, and not on behalf of ours only, but also on behalf of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>And by this we feel that we know him, if we keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>For he who saith that he knoweth him, and his commandments keepeth not, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.5'>But he who keepeth his word, in him is perfected truly the love of Aloha; for by this we know that we are in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.6'>He who saith, I am in him, ought according to his walkings to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>MY beloved, a new commandment I write not to you, but the old commandment, that which was with you from the beginning; but the old commandment is the word which you have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, a new commandment I write to you, that which is true in him and in you; because the darkness hath passed, and the true light beginneth to appear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>Whoever saith, then, that he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is in darkness until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loveth his brother, in the light abideth, and offence is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>He who hateth his brother is in darkness, and in the darkness walketh, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because the darkness itself hath blinded his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.12'>I write to you, sons, because forgiven to you are your sins for the sake of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I write to you, fathers, because you have known him who hath been from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you have overcome the wicked. I have written to you, children, because you have known the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I have written to you, fathers, because you have known Him who (hath been) from the beginning. I have written to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of Aloha remaineth in you, and you have overcome the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Love not the world, nor any thing which is in it; for whoever loveth the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>For every thing that is in the world, is the lust of the body, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of the world. These which are not of the Father, but they are from the world itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.17'>And the world passeth, (both) it and its lusts; but he who doeth the will of Aloha, continueth for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>my sons, it is the last time: and as you have heard, the false meshiha cometh; and now there are many false meshihas, and from this we know that it is the last time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>From us they went forth, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, with us would they have remained. But they went forth from us, that it might be known that they were not of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.20'>And you have an anointing from the Holy, and you discern every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.21'>I have not written to you because you know not the truth, but you know it, and that no lie is of it, of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.22'>Who is a liar, if not he who denieth that Jeshu is the Meshiha? and this (one) is a false meshiha. He who denieth the Father, denieth also the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.23'>and he who denieth the Son, disbelieveth also the Father. Whoso confesseth the Son, the Father also confesseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.24'>And you, what you have heard from the first, let it continue with you. For, if what you have heard from the first continue with you, you also will continue in the Father and in the Son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.25'>And this is the promise which he promised to us, eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>But these I have written to you, because of those who would seduce you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>And you, also, if the anointing continue with you which you have received from him, have not need that a man should teach you; but as the anointing that is from Aloha itself teacheth you concerning every thing, and is true, neither is falsity in it; and as it hath taught you, continue in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, my sons, continue in him: that when he is manifested we may not he confounded of him, but we may have confidence at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.29'>If you know that he is righteous, know also that every one who doeth righteousness is of him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1John.3'>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.1'>And see how great is the love of the Father toward us, that sons he hath called us, and also made us! Therefore the world doth not know us, because that it hath also not known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.2'>MY beloved, now are we the sons of Aloha; and it is not manifest, as yet, what we are to become, but we know, that when he is manifested, in his likeness we are and see him, according to that which he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And every one who hath in him this hope, purifieth himself, as He is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>But whoever committeth sin doeth iniquity; for all sin is iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And you know that he was manifested to bear our sins, and sin in him is not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>And every one who in him abideth, sinneth not. And every one who sinneth, hath not seen him, nor known him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.7'>My sons, let no man deceive you: he who worketh righteousness is righteous, as also the Meshiha himself is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>And he who doeth sin is of Satana, because that from the commencement Satana was a sinner. And for this cause did the Son of Aloha appear, that he might destroy the works of Satana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>Every one who is born of Aloha, sin doth not work, because that his seed is in him, and he cannot sin, because of Aloha he is born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>In this are distinguished the sons of Aloha from the sons of Satana; every one who doeth not righteousness, nor loveth his brother, is not of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>For this is the commandment which you have heard from before, that you love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>Not as Koen, who was from the Evil, and killed his brother. And on what account killed he him? unless that his own works were evil and his brother's righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not wonder, my brethren, if the world hate you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have passed from death unto life, by this, that we love our brethren. He who loveth not his brother, in death continueth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.15'>For every one who hateth his brother is a man-killer; and we know that in no man-killer can abide the life which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>In this we know His love toward us, that he gave himself for us; (so) also it is right for us for the sake of our brethren to give ourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>And he who hath the possession of the world, and shall see his brother that he needeth, and shall shut his compassions from him, how is there in him the love of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My sons, let us not love one another in words and in tongue, but in works and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And by this we make known that we are of the truth, and before that he cometh we make confident our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>And if our heart condemn us, how much (more) Aloha, who is greater than our heart, and knoweth every thing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>My beloved, if our heart condemn us not, we have openness of face before Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>And whatever we ask, we shall receive from him, because we keep his commandments, and do the things which are beautiful before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.23'>And this is his commandment, That we believe in the name of his Son Jeshu Meshiha, and love one another, as he hath commanded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.24'>And he who keepeth his commandments, is kept by him, and he dwelleth in him: and by this we perceive that he dwelleth in us, by his Spirit whom he hath given to us.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1John.4'>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.1'>MY beloved, believe not all spirits, but discern the spirits whether they be from Aloha; because many false prophets have gone forth into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.2'>By this we know the Spirit of Aloha: Every spirit who confesseth that Jeshu Meshiha hath come in the flesh, is from Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.3'>And every spirit who confesseth not that Jeshu hath come in the flesh, is not from Aloha: but this is from that false meshiha, of whom you have heard that he cometh, and now is in the world already.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.4.7'>my beloved, let us love one another, because love is of Aloha; and every one who loveth from Aloha is born, and knoweth Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.8'>For Aloha is Love; and every one who loveth not, knoweth not Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.9'>In this was made known the love of Aloha towards us, that Aloha sent his only Son into the world that we might live by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.10'>In this is love: it was not that we had loved Aloha, but that Aloha himself loved us, and sent his Son a propitiation for our sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.11'>MY beloved, if Aloha so hath loved us, we also are indebted to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.12'>Aloha no man hath seen but if we love one another, Aloha in us abideth, and his love is fulfilled in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.13'>And by this we know that in him we abide, and he abideth in us, because of his Spirit he hath given us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.14'>And we have seen and we testify that the Father hath sent his Son, the Redeemer of the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.4.17'>And in this is his love perfected with us, that openness of face we might have in the day of judgment; because that as He was, so also we are in this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.18'>Fear in love is not: but perfect love hath cast out fear, because fear is in terror. He who feareth is not perfect in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.19'>We then will love Aloha, because he hath first loved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.20'>But if one shall say, I love Aloha, and his brother he hateth, he is a liar. For he who his brother whom he hath seen loveth not, how can he love Aloha himself whom he hath not seen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.4.21'>And this commandment we have received from him, That every one who loveth Aloha shall love also his brother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>And the accuser who seduced them was cast into the lake of fire and of sulphur, as was also the beast of prey and the false prophet; and they will be tormented day and night for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.11'>And I saw a great white throne, and Him who sat thereon, from whom from his face fled earth and heaven; and place (as) to this was not found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.12'>And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne; and the books were opened; and another book was opened, which is (the Book) of Life. And the dead were judged from the (records) which are written in the books according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.13'>And the sea gave up the dead which were in it, and death and shiul gave up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every one according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.14'>And death and shiul were cast into the lake of fire, which is the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.15'>And if a man was not found written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</verse>
