      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham became the father of Isaac, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob became the father of Judah and his brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>and Judah became the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez became the father of Hezron, and Hezron became the father of Aram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>and Aram became the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab became the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon became the father of Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>and Salmon became the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz became the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed became the father of Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse became the father of David the king.And David became the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>and Solomon became the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam became the father of Abijah, and Abijah became the father of Asa,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>and Asa became the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat became the father of Joram, and Joram became the father of Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>and Uzziah became the father of Jotham, and Jotham became the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz became the father of Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>and Hezekiah became the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh became the father of Amon, and Amon became the father of Josiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>and Josiah became the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah became the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel became the father of Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>and Zerubbabel became the father of Abiud, and Abiud became the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim became the father of Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>and Azor became the father of Zadok, and Zadok became the father of Achim, and Achim became the father of Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>and Eliud became the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar became the father of Matthan, and Matthan became the father of Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>and Jacob became the father of Joseph, the husband of Mary by whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>Therefore all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon are fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ are fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ occurred in this way. His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, but before they came together, she was found ˻to be pregnant˼ by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>So Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wanting to disgrace her, intended to divorce her secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But as he was considering these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she will give birth to a son, and you will call his name ‘Jesus,’ because he will save his people from their sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this happened in order that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>“Behold, the virgin ˻will become pregnant˼ and will give birth to a son,and they will call his name Emmanuel,”which is translated, “God with us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>And Joseph, when he woke up from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him, and he took his wife</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>and ˻did not have sexual relations with˼ her until she gave birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, “Where is the one who has been born king of the Jews? For we have seen his star at its rising and have come to worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>And when King Herod heard it, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and after calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>So they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,are by no means least among the rulers of Judah,for from you will go out a rulerwho will shepherd my people Israel.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod secretly summoned the wise men and determined precisely from them the time when the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And he sent them to Bethlehem and said, “Go, inquire carefully concerning the child, and when you have found him, report to me so that I also may come and worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>After they listened to the king, they went out, and behold, the star which they had seen at its rising led them until it came and stood above the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>Now when they saw the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And when they came into the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. And opening their treasure boxes, they offered him gifts of gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they went back to their own country by another route.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now after they had gone away, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph, saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you. For Herod is about to seek the child to destroy him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>So he got up and took the child and his mother during the night and went away to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>And he was there until the death of Herod, in order that what was said by the Lord through the prophet would be fulfilled, saying,“Out of Egypt I called my son.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, became very angry, and he sent soldiersand executed all the children in Bethlehem and in all the region around it from the age of two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined precisely from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>“A voice was heard in Ramah,weeping and great mourning,Rachel weeping for her children,and she did not want to be comforted,because ˻they exist no longer˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>Now after Herod had died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, “Get up, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the child are dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>So he got up and took the child and his mother and ˻entered˼ the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream, he took refuge in the regions of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And he came and lived in a town called Nazareth, in order that what was said by the prophets would be fulfilled: “He will be called a Nazarene.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>Now in those days John the Baptist came preaching in the Judean wilderness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is the one who was spoken about by the prophet Isaiah, saying,“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>Now John himself had his clothing made from camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the district around the Jordan were going out to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan River as they confessed their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentence!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>And do not think to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Already now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I baptize you with water for repentence, but the one who comes after me is more powerful than I am, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing shovel is in his hand, and he will clean out his threshing floor and will gather his wheat into the storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John in order to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John tried to prevent him, saying, “˻I need˼ to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered and said to him, “Permit it now, for in this way it is right for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permitted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>Now after he was baptized, Jesus immediately went up from the water, and behold, the heavens opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And behold, there was a voice from heaven saying, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit to be tempted by the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>and after he had fasted forty days and forty nights, then he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And the tempter approached and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order that these stones become bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered and said, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone, but on every word that comes out of the mouth of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him to the holy city and placed him on the highest point of the temple</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down! For it is written,‘He will command his angels concerning you,’and‘On their hands they will lift you up,lest you strike your foot against a stone.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, “On the other hand it is written, ‘You are not to put the Lord your God to the test.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and he said to him, “I will give to you all these things, if you will fall down and worship me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, “Go away, Satan, for it is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God and serve only him.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and began ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when he heard that John ˻had been arrested˼, he withdrew into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth, he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>in order that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,˻toward the sea˼, on the other side of the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people who sit in darknesshave seen a great light,and the ones who sit in the land and shadow of death,a light has dawned on them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time on, Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Now as he was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter and his brother Andrew, throwing a casting net into the sea (for they were fishermen).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he said to them, “˻Follow me˼ and I will make you fishers of people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>And immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, in the boat with their father Zebedee, mending their nets, and he called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And he went around through all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And a report about him went out ˻throughout˼ Syria, and they brought to him all those ˻who were sick˼ with various diseases and afflicted by torments and demon-possessed and epileptics and paralytics, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And large crowds followed him from Galilee, Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Now when he saw the crowds, he went up the mountain and after he sat down, his disciples approached him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And opening his mouth he began to teach them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>“Blessed are the poor in spirit,because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed are the ones who mourn,because they will be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed are the meek,because they will inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed are the ones who hunger and thirst for righteousness,because they will be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed are the merciful,because they will be shown mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed are the pure in heart,because they will see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed are the peacemakers,because they will be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,because theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are youwhen they insult you and persecute you and say all kinds of evil things against you, lying on account of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be glad, because your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>“You are the salt of the earth. But if salt becomes tasteless, by what will it be made salty? It is good for nothing any longer except to be thrown outside and trampled under foot by people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city located on top of a hill cannot be hidden,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>nor do they light a lamp and place it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on all those in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>In the same way let your light shine before people, so that they can see your good works and glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>“Do not think that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets. I have not come to destroy them but to fulfill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one tiny letter or one stroke of a letter will pass away from the law until all takes place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Therefore whoever abolishes one of the least of these commandments and teaches people to do so will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever keeps them and teaches them, this person will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you that unless your righteousness greatly surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>“You have heard that it was said to the ˻people of old˼, ‘Do not commit murder,’ and ‘whoever commits murder will be subject to judgment.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you that everyone who is angry at his brother will be subject to judgment, and whoever says to his brother, ‘Stupid fool!’ will be subject to the council, and whoever says, ‘Obstinate fool!’ will be subject to fiery hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if you present your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar and first go be reconciled to your brother, and then come and present your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>˻Settle the case quickly with your accuser˼ while you are with him on the way, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Truly I say to you, you will never come out of there until you have paid back the last penny!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>And if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your members be destroyed than your whole body be thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it from you! For it is better for you that one of your limbs be destroyed than your whole body go into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>“And it was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a certificate of divorce.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>“Again you have heard that it was said to the ˻people of old˼, ‘Do not swear falsely, but fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I say to you, do not swear at all, either by heaven, because it is the throne of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>or by the earth, because it is the footstool of his feet, or by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>And do not swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your statement be ‘Yes, yes; no, no,’ and anything beyond these is from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you, do not resist the evildoer, but whoever strikes you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And the one who wants to go to court with you and take your tunic, ˻let him have˼ your outer garment also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to the one who asks you, and do not turn away from the one who wants to borrow from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor’ and ‘Hate your enemy.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>in order that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven, because he causes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not the tax collectors also do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing that is remarkable? Do not the Gentiles also do the same?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>Therefore you be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.</verse>
      </chapter>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>“And take care not to practice your righteousness before people to be seen by them; ˻otherwise˼ you have no reward from your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Therefore whenever you practice charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet in front of you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, in order that they may be praised by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But you, when you practice charitable giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>in order that your charitable giving may be in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>And whenever you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and on the corners of the streets, in order that they may be seen by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But whenever you pray, enter into your inner room and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>“But when you pray, do not babble repetitiously like the pagans, for they think that because of their many words they will be heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Therefore do not be like them, for your Father knows ˻what you need˼ before you ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Therefore you pray in this way:“Our Father who is in heaven,may your name be treated as holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>May your kingdom come,may your will be doneon earth as it is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us today our daily bread,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>and forgive us our debts,as we also have forgiven our debtors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>And do not bring us into temptation,but deliver us from the evil one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>For if you forgive people their sins, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if you do not forgive people, neither will your Father forgive your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>“Whenever you fast, do not be sullen like the hypocrites, for they make their faces unrecognizable in order that they may be seen fasting by people. Truly I say to you, they have received their reward in full!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But when you are fasting, ˻put olive oil on your head˼ and wash your face</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.18'>so that you will not be seen by people as fasting, but to your Father who is in secret, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.19'>“Do not store up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and consuming insect destroy and where thieves break in and steal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.20'>but store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor consuming insect destroy and where thieves do not break in or steal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.21'>For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.22'>“The eye is the lamp of the body. Therefore if your eye is sincere, your whole body will be full of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.23'>But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore if the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>“No one is able to serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You are not able to serve God and money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>“For this reason I say to you, do not be anxious for your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, and not for your body, what you will wear. Is your life not more than food and your body more than clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Consider the birds of the sky, that they do not sow or reap or gather produce into barns, and your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they are?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>And who among you, by being anxious, is able to add one hour to his life span?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>And why are you anxious about clothing? Observe the lilies of the field, how they grow: they do not toil or spin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>but I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory was dressed like one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>But if God dresses the grass of the field in this way, although it is here today and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not do so much more for you, you of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore do not be anxious, saying, ‘What will we eat?’ or ‘What will we drink?’ or ‘What will we wear?,’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>for the pagans seek after all these things. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Therefore do not be anxious for tomorrow, because tomorrow will be anxious for itself. ˻Each day has enough trouble of its own.˼</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.7.1'>“Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.2'>For by what judgment you judge, you will be judged, and by what measure you measure out, it will be measured out to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.3'>And why do you see the speck that is in your brother’s eye, but do not notice the beam of wood in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.4'>Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Allow me to remove the speck from your eye,’ and behold, the beam of wood is in your own eye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.5'>Hypocrite! First remove the beam of wood from your own eye and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.6'>“Do not give what is holy to dogs, or throw your pearls in front of pigs, lest they trample them with their feet, and turn around and tear you to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.7'>“Ask and it will be given to you; seek and you will find; knock and it will be opened for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.8'>For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.9'>Or what man is there among you, if his son will ask him for bread, will give him a stone?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.10'>Or also if he will ask for a fish, will give him a snake?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.11'>Therefore if you, although you are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.12'>Therefore in all things, whatever you want that people should do to you, thus also you do to them. For this is the law and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.13'>“Enter through the narrow gate, because broad is the gate and spacious is the road that leads to destruction, and there are many who enter through it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.14'>How narrow is the gate and constricted the road that leads to life, and there are few who find it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.15'>“Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inside are ravenous wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.16'>You will recognize them by their fruits: they do not gather grapes from thorn bushes or figs from thistles, do they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.17'>In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a bad tree produces bad fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.18'>A good tree is not able to produce bad fruit, nor a bad tree to produce good fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.19'>Every tree that does not produce good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.20'>As a result, you will recognize them by their fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.21'>“Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.22'>On that day many will say to me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and expel demons in your name, and perform many miracles in your name?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.23'>And then ˻I will say to them plainly˼, ‘I never knew you. Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.24'>“Therefore everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.25'>And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it did not collapse, because its foundation was laid on the rock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.26'>And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.27'>And the rain came down and the rivers came and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it collapsed, and its fall was great.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.28'>And it happened when Jesus finished these words the crowds were amazed at his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.7.29'>because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like their scribes.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.8'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>And when he came down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>And behold, a leper approached and worshiped him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And extending his hand he touched him, saying, “I am willing, be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jesus said to him, “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>Now when he entered Capernaum, a centurion approached him, appealing to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>and saying, “Lord, my slave is lying paralyzed in my house, terribly tormented!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>And he said to him, “I will come and heal him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>And the centurion answered and said, “Lord, I am not worthy that you should come in under my roof. But only say the word and my slave will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I also am a man under authority who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>Now when Jesus heard this, he was astonished, and said to those who were following him, “Truly I say to you, I have found such great faith with no one in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>But I say to you that many will come from east and west and ˻be seated at the banquet˼ with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go, as you have believed it will be done for you.” And his slave was healed at that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>And when Jesus came into Peter’s house, he saw his mother-in-law lying down and suffering with a fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>And he touched her hand and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>Now when it was evening, they brought to him many who were demon-possessed, and he expelled the spirits with a word. And he healed all ˻those who were sick˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>in order that what was spoken through the prophet Isaiah would be fulfilled, who said,“He himself took away our sicknesses,and carried away our diseases.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>Now when Jesus saw a crowd around him, he gave orders to depart to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>And a scribe approached and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>And another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, allow me first to go and bury my father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jesus said to him, “Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>And as he got into the boat, his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>And behold, a great storm arose on the sea, so that the boat was being inundated by the waves, but he himself was asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>And they came and woke him, saying, “Lord, save us! We are perishing!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>And he said to them, “Why are you fearful, you of little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>And the men were astonished, saying, “What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And when he came to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men coming from among the tombs met him, very violent, so that no one was able to pass by along that road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>And behold, they cried out, saying, “˻What do you have to do with us˼, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now a long way from them a large herd of pigs was feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>So the demons implored him, saying, “If you are going to expel us, send us into the herd of pigs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>And he said to them, “Go!” So they departed and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and drowned in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>Now the herdsmen fled and went into the town and reported everything, including the things concerning the demon-possessed men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>And behold, the whole town came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they implored him that he would depart from their region.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>And getting into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>And behold, they brought to him a paralytic lying on a stretcher, and when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Have courage, child, your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, “This man is blaspheming!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>And perceiving their thoughts, Jesus said, “Why do you think evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” then he said to the paralytic, “Get up, pick up your stretcher and go to your home.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>And he got up and went to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>But when the crowds saw this, they were afraid and glorified God who had given such authority to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>And as Jesus was going away from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth and said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>And it happened as he ˻was dining˼ in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners were coming and˻dining˼ with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And when they saw it, the Pharisees began to say to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>And when he heard it, he said, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those ˻who are sick˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>But go and learn what it means, “I want mercy and not sacrifice.” For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then the disciples of John approached him, saying, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples do not fast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>And Jesus said to them, “˻The bridegroom’s attendants˼ are not able to mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them. But days are coming when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>But no one puts a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment, for its patch pulls away from the garment, and the tear becomes worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins. ˻Otherwise˼ the wineskins burst and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins and both are preserved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>As he was saying these things to them, behold, one of the rulers came and knelt down before him, saying, “My daughter has just now died, but come, place your hand on her and she will live!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>And Jesus and his disciples got up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And behold, a woman who had been suffering with a hemorrhage twelve years approached from behind and touched the edge of his cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>for she said to herself, “If only I touch his cloak I will be healed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, “Have courage, daughter! Your faith has healed you.” And the woman was healed from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And when Jesus came into the ruler’s house and saw the flute players and the disorderly crowd,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>he said, “Go away, because the girl is not dead, but is sleeping.” And they ridiculed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>But when the crowd had been sent out, he entered and took her hand, and the girl got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>And this report went out into that whole region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>And as Jesus was going away from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>And when he came into the house, the blind men approached him, and Jesus said to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?” They said to him, “Yes, Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then he touched their eyes, saying, “According to your faith let it be done for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>And their eyes were opened, and Jesus sternly warned them, saying, “See that no one finds out.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they went out and spread the report about him in that whole region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>Now as they were going away, behold, they brought to him a demon-possessed man who was unable to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>And after the demon had been expelled, the one who had been mute spoke, and the crowds were astonished, saying, “˻This has never been seen before˼ in Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees were saying, “By the ruler of demons he expels the demons!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>And Jesus was going around all the towns and the villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and healing every disease and every sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>And when he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were weary and dejected, like sheep that did not have a shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then he said to his disciples, “The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>Therefore ask the Lord of the harvest that he send out workers into his harvest.”</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>And summoning his twelve disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could expel them and could heal every disease and every sickness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.2'>Now these are the names of the twelve apostles: first Simon who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother, and James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.36'>Then he left the crowds and came into the house, and his disciples came to him saying, “Explain the parable of the darnel in the field to us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.37'>So he answered and said, “The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.53'>And it happened that when Jesus had finished these parables he went away from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.13.54'>And he came to his hometown and began to teach them in their synagogue, so that they were amazed and said, “From where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.13.57'>And they were offended by him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown and in his own household.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For Herod, after arresting John, bound him and put him in prison on account of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.4'>because John had been saying to him, “It is not permitted for you to have her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>And although he wanted to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they looked upon him as a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>But when Herod’s birthday celebration took place, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst of them and pleased Herod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.8'>And coached by her mother, she said, “Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.9'>And although the king was distressed, because of his oaths and his ˻dinner guests˼ he commanded the request to be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.10'>And he sent ordersand had John beheaded in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.11'>and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.13'>Now when Jesus heard it, he withdrew from there in a boat to an isolated place by himself. And when the crowds heard it, they followed him by land from the towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.14'>And as he got out, he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.15'>Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him saying, “The place is desolate and the hour ˻is late˼. Release the crowds so that they can go away into the villages and purchase food for themselves.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.16'>But Jesus said to them, “They do not ˻need˼ to go away. You give them something to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.17'>And they said to him, “We do not have anything here except five loaves and two fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.18'>So he said, “Bring them here to me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.19'>And he commanded the crowds to recline for a meal on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks. And after breaking them, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.20'>And they all ate and were satisfied, and they picked up what was left over of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.21'>Now those who ate were about five thousand men, in addition to women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>And immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go ahead of him to the other side, while he sent away the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.23'>And after he sent away the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. So when evening came, he was there alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.24'>But the boat was already many stadia distant from the land, being beaten by the waves, because the wind was against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.25'>And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>But the disciples, when they saw him walking on the sea, were terrified, saying, “It is a ghost!” and they cried out in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.28'>And Peter answered him and said, “Lord, if ˻it is you˼, command me to come to you on the water!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.30'>But when he saw the strong wind, he was afraid. And beginning to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.31'>And immediately Jesus extended his hand and caught him and said to him, “You of little faith! Why did you doubt?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>And when they got into the boat, the wind abated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>So those in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>And after they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent word into that whole surrounding region, and they brought to him all those ˻who were sick˼.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>So he answered and said to them, “Why do you also break the commandment of God because of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For God said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother ˻must certainly die˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.5'>But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or his mother, “Whatever ˻benefit you would have received˼ from me is a gift to God,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.6'>need not honor his father,’ and you make void the word of God for the sake of your tradition.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.10'>And summoning the crowd, he said to them, “Hear and understand:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.12'>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.13'>And he answered and said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be uprooted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.22'>And behold, a Canaanite woman from that district came and cried out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely possessed by a demon!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.23'>But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came up and asked him, saying, “Send her away, because she is crying out after us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.24'>But he answered and said, “I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>And he answered and said, “It is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.27'>So she said, “Yes, Lord, for even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their master’s table.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.28'>Then Jesus answered and said to her, “O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.29'>And departing from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and he went up on the mountain and was sitting there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.30'>And large crowds came to him, having with them the lame, blind, crippled, mute, and many others, and they put them down at his feet, and he healed them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.32'>And Jesus summoned his disciples and said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat, and I do not want to send them away hungry lest they give out on the way.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.33'>And the disciples said to him, “Where in this desolate place ˻can we get˼ so much bread that such a great crowd could be satisfied?”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.16.7'>So they were discussing this among themselves, saying, “It is because we did not take bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>But knowing this, Jesus said, “Why are you discussing among yourselves that you do not have bread, you of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Do you not yet understand or do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you took up?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.17.4'>So Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good that we are here! If you want, I will make here three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.5'>While he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud said, “This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.30'>But he did not want to, but rather he went and threw him into prison until he would repay what was owed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>So when his fellow slaves saw what had happened, they were extremely distressed, and went and reported to their master everything that had happened.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>On that day Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.24'>saying, “Teacher, Moses said if someone dies without having children, his brother is to marry his wife and ˻father˼ descendants for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.25'>Now there were seven brothers with us. And the first died after getting married, and because he did not have descendants, he left his wife to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.26'>So also the second and the third, up to the seventh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.27'>And last of all the woman died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.28'>In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had her as wife.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.29'>But Jesus answered and said to them, “You are mistaken, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.30'>For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.31'>Now concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God, who said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.32'>“I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob”? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.33'>And when the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.34'>Now when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they assembled at the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>And one of them, a legal expert, put a question to him to test him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>“Teacher, which commandment is greatest in the law?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>And he said to him, “ ‘You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.38'>This is the greatest and first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.39'>And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.40'>On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.41'>Now while the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.42'>saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?” They said to him, “David’s.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.43'>He said to them, “How then does David, by the Spirit, call him ‘Lord,’ saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.44'>‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right handuntil I put your enemiesunder your feet” ’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.45'>If then David calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.46'>And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask him any more questions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>And it happened that when Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>“You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man will be handed over in order to be crucified.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then the chief priests and the elders of the people assembled in the palace of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>and plotted in order that they could arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they were saying, “Not during the feast, so that there will not be an uproar among the people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>Now while Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came up to him holding an alabaster flask of very expensive perfumed oil, and poured it out on his head while he was reclining at table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>And when the disciples saw it they were indignant, saying, “˻Why˼ this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, “Why do you cause trouble for the woman? For she has done a good deed for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For the poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For when this woman poured this ointment on my body, she did it in order to prepare me for burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this woman has done will also be told in memory of her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, the one named Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said, “What are you willing to give me if I in turn deliver him to you?” So they set out for him thirty silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from that time on, he began seeking a favorable opportunity in order that he could betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of the feast of Unleavened Bread the disciples came up to Jesus, saying, “Where do you want us to prepare for you to eat the Passover?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And he said, “Go into the city to a certain man and tell him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I am celebrating the Passover with you with my disciples.” ’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And when it was evening, he was reclining at table with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>And while they were eating he said, “Truly I say to you, that one of you will betray me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And greatly distressed, each one began to say to him, “˻Surely I am not he, am I˼, Lord?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>And he answered and said, “The one who dips his hand in the bowl with me—this one will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man is going just as it is written about him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would be better for him if that man had not been born.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>And Judas, the one who was betraying him, answered and said, “˻Surely I am not he, am I˼, Rabbi?” He said to him, “You have said it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>Now while they were eating Jesus took bread and, after giving thanks, he broke it, and giving it to the disciples, he said, “Take, eat, this is my body.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>And after taking the cup and giving thanks he gave it to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>for this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I tell you, from now on I will never drink of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And after they had sung the hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, “You will all fall away because of me during this night, for it is written,‘I will strike the shepherdand the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>But after I am raised, I will go ahead of you into Galilee.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>But Peter answered and said to him, “If they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that during this night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to him, “Even if it is necessary for me to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to the disciples, “Sit here while I go over there and pray.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be distressed and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he said to them, “My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Remain here and stay awake with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>And going forward a little he fell down on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, “So, were you not able to stay awake with me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Stay awake and pray that you will not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again for the second time he went away and prayed, saying, “My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will must be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And he came again and found them sleeping, ˻for they could not keep their eyes open˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same thing again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came to the disciples and said to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour is near, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Get up, let us go! Behold, the one who is betraying me is approaching!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while he was still speaking, behold, Judas—one of the twelve—arrived, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the one who was betraying him had given them a sign, saying, “The one whom I kiss—he is the one. Arrest him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And he came up to Jesus immediately and said, “Greetings, Rabbi,” and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>And Jesus said to him, “Friend, do that for which you have come.” Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold, one of those with Jesus extended his hand and drew his sword, and striking the slave of the high priest, cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Then Jesus said to him, “Put your sword back into its place! For all who take up the sword will die by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or do you think that I cannot call upon my Father, and he would put at my disposal at once more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then would the scriptures be fulfilled that it must happen in this way?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>At that time Jesus said to the crowds, “Have you come out with swords and clubs, as against a robber, to arrest me? Every day in the temple courts I sat teaching, and you did not arrest me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened in order that the scriptures of the prophets would be fulfilled.” Then the disciples all abandoned him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Now those who had arrested Jesus led him away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And he went inside and was sitting with the officers to see the outcome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests and the whole Sanhedrin were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order that they could put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>And they did not find it, although many false witnesses came forward. And finally two came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, “This man said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and rebuild it within three days.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And the high priest stood up and said to him, “Do you reply nothing? What are these people testifying against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I put you under oath by the living God, that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, “You have said it. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Behold, you have just now heard the blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think?” And they answered and said, “˻He deserves death˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in his face and struck him with their fists, and they slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, “Prophesy for us, you Christ! Who is it who hit you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and a female slave came up to him and said, “You also were with Jesus the Galilean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it in the presence of them all, saying, “I do not know what you mean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he went out to the gateway, another female slave saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus the Nazarene.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>And again he denied it with an oath, “I do not know the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a little while those who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “You really are one of them also, because even your accent ˻reveals who you are˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the statement Jesus had said, “Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times,” and he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>Now when it was early morning, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus in order to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And after tying him up, they led him away and handed him over to Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then when Judas, the one who had betrayed him, saw that he had been condemned, he regretted what he had doneand returned the thirty silver coins to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood!” But they said, “What is that to us? You see to it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And throwing the silver coins into the temple he departed. And he went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests took the silver coins and said, “It is not permitted to put them into the temple treasury, because it is ˻blood money˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And after taking counsel, they purchased ˻with˼ them the Potter’s Field, for a burial place for strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>(For this reason that field has been called the Field of Blood until today.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled, who said, “And they took the thirty silver coins, the price of the one who had been priced, on whom a price had been set by the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the potter’s field, just as the Lord directed me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>So Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, saying, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And Jesus said, “You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And ˻when he was being accused˼ by the chief priests and elders he answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And he did not reply to him, not even with reference to one statement, so that the governor was very astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at each feast, the governor was accustomed to release one prisoner to the crowd—the one whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And at that time they had a notorious prisoner named Jesus Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So after they had assembled, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want me to release for you—Jesus Barabbas or Jesus who is called Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>(For he knew that they had handed him over because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>And while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent a message to him, saying, “˻Have nothing to do with that righteous man˼, for I have suffered much as a result of a dream today because of him.”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas and put Jesus to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>So the governor answered and said to them, “Which of the two do you want me to release for you?” And they said, “Barabbas!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, the one who is called Christ?” They all said, “Let him be crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>And he said, “Why? What wrong has he done?” But they began to shout even louder, saying, “Let him be crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>So Pilate, when he saw that he was accomplishing nothing, but instead an uproar was developing, took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of the blood of this man. You see to it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered and said, “His blood be on us and on our children!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas for them, but after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over so that he could be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor’s residence and gathered the whole cohort to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And they stripped him and put a scarlet military cloak around him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on his head, and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling down before him, they mocked him, saying, “Hail, king of the Jews!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And they spat on him and took the reed and repeatedly struck him on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the military cloak and put his own clothes on him, and led him away in order to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And as they were going out, they found a man of Cyrene ˻named˼ Simon. They forced this man to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which ˻means Place of a Skull˼),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink, and when he tasted it he did not want to drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And when they had crucified him, they divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And they sat down and were watching over him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put above his head the charge against him ˻in writing˼: “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, “The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes and elders, were mocking him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>“He saved others; he is not able to save himself! He is the king of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusts in God; let him deliver him now if he wants to, because he said, ‘I am the Son of God’!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>And in the same way even the robbers who were crucified with him were reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour, darkness came over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?” (that is, “My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>And some of those who were standing there, when they heard it, said, “This man is summoning Elijah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>And immediately one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the others said, “Leave him alone! let us see if Elijah is coming to save him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom, and the earth shook and the rocks were split.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>Now the centurion and those with him who were guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that took place, were extremely frightened, saying, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And there were many women there, observing from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>Now when it was evening, a rich man from Arimathea named Joseph came, who also was a disciple of Jesus himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and placed it in his own new tomb that he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a large stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>Now on the next day, which is after the day of preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees assembled before Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, “Sir, we remember that while that deceiver was still alive he said, ‘After three days I will rise.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Therefore give orders that the tomb be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples come and steal him and tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, “You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you know how.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went with the guard of soldiers and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>Now after the Sabbath, at the dawning on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to view the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came up and rolled away the stone and sat down on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>Now his appearance was like lightning and his clothing white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>And the guards trembled from the fear of him and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the angel answered and said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here, for he has been raised, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>And go quickly, tell his disciples, ‘He has been raised from the dead, and behold, he is going ahead of you into Galilee. You will see him there.’ Behold, I have told you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And behold, Jesus met them, saying, “Greetings!” And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid! Go tell my brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>And while they were going, behold, some of the guard of soldiers went into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>And after they had assembled with the elders and had taken counsel, they gave a rather large sum of money to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>telling them, “Say ‘His disciples came during the night and stole him while we were sleeping.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>And if this matter is heard before the governor, we will satisfy him and ˻keep you out of trouble˼.”</verse>
