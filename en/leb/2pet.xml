      <chapter osisID='2Pet.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.1'>Simeon Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ, to those who have obtained a faith equal in value to ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.2'>May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.3'>because his divine power has bestowed on us all thingsthat are necessary for life and godliness, through the knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence of character,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.4'>through which things he has bestowed on us his precious and very great promises, so that through these you may become sharers of the divine nature after escaping from the corruption that is in the world because of evil desire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.5'>and for this same reason, and by applying all diligence, supply with your faith excellence of character, and with excellence of character, knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.6'>and with knowledge, self-control, and with self-control, patient endurance, and with patient endurance, godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.7'>and with godliness, brotherly love, and with brotherly love, love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.8'>For if these things are yours and are increasing, this does not make you useless or unproductive in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.9'>For the one for whom these thingsare not present is blind, being nearsighted, ˻having forgotten the cleansing˼ of his former sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.10'>Therefore, brothers, be zealous even more to make your calling and election secure, because if you do these things, you will never ever stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.11'>For in this way entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ will be richly supplied for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.12'>Therefore I intend to remind you continually concerning these things, although you know them and are established in the truth that you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.13'>But I consider it right, for as long as I am in this habitation, to stir you up by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.14'>because I know that the removal of my habitation is imminent, as indeed our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.15'>And I will also make every effort that you are able at any time, after my departure, ˻to recall these things to mind˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.16'>For we did not make known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ by following ingeniously concocted myths, but by being eyewitnesses of that one’s majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.17'>For he received honor and glory from God the Father when a voice such as this was brought to him by the Majestic Glory, “This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.18'>And we ourselves heard this voice brought from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>and we possess as more reliable the prophetic word, to which you do well if you pay attention to it as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.20'>recognizing this above all, that every prophecy of scripture does not come about from one’s own interpretation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>for no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men carried along by the Holy Spirit spoke from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there were also false prophets among the people, as there will be false teachers among you also, who will bring in ˻destructive heresies˼, even denying the Master who bought them, thus bringing on themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many will follow their licentious ways, because of whom the way of truth will be reviled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And in greediness they will exploit you with false words, whose condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not spare the angels who sinned, but held them captive in Tartarus with chains of darkness and handed them over to be kept for judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a proclaimer of righteousness, ˻and seven others˼when he brought a flood on the world of the ungodly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to destruction, reducing them to ashes, having appointed themas an example for those who are going to be ungodly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.7'>and rescued righteous Lot, worn down by the way of life of lawless persons in licentiousness</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for that righteous man, as he lived among them day after day, was tormenting his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he was seeing and hearing),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials and to reserve the unrighteous to be punished at the day of judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>and especially those who go after the flesh in defiling lust and who despise authority.Bold and arrogant, they do not tremble in awe as they blaspheme majestic beings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas angels, who are greater in strength and power, do not bring against them a demeaning judgment from the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these persons, like irrational animals born only with natural instincts for capture and killing, blaspheming ˻about things˼ they do not understand, in their destruction will also be destroyed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>being harmed as the wages of unrighteousness. Considering reveling in the daytime a pleasure, they are stains and blemishes, carousing in their deceitful pleasures when they feast together with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of desire for an adulteress and unceasing from sin, enticing unstable persons, and having hearts trained for greediness. Accursed children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>By leaving the straight path, they have gone astray, because they followed the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>but received a rebuke for his own lawlessness: a speechless donkey, speaking with a human voice, restrained ˻the prophet’s madness˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These people are waterless springs and mists driven by a hurricane, for whom the gloom of darkness has been reserved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>˻For by speaking high-sounding but empty words˼, they entice with desires of the flesh and with licentiousness those who are scarcely escaping from those who live in error,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>promising them freedom although they themselves are slaves of depravity. For to whatever someone succumbs, by this he is enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if, after they have escaped from the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and they are again entangled in these thingsand succumb to them, the last state has become worse for them than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than having known it, to turn back from the holy commandment that had been delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>The statement of the true proverb has happened to them, “A dog returns to its own vomit,” and “A sow, after washing herself, returns to wallowing in the mud.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>Dear friends, this is already the second letter I am writing to you, in both of which I am attempting to stir up your sincere mind by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>to remember the words proclaimed beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>above all knowing this, that in the last days scoffers will come with scoffing, following according to their own desires</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, “Where is the promise of his coming? For ˻ever since˼ the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued just as they have been from the beginning of creation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that the heavens existed long ago and the earth held together out of water and through water by the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by means of which things the world that existed at that time was destroyed by being inundated with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>But by the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>Now, dear friends, do not let this one thing escape your notice, that one day with the Lord is like a thousand years, and a thousand years is like one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord is not delaying the promise, as some consider slowness, but is being patient toward you, because he does not want any to perish, but all to come to repentence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, in which the heavens will disappear with a rushing noise, and the celestial bodies will be destroyed by being burned up, and the earth and the deeds done on it will be disclosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Because all these things are being destroyed in this way, what sort of people must you be in holy behavior and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>while waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by being burned up and the celestial bodies will melt as they are consumed by heat!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But according to his promise, we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness resides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, dear friends, because you are waiting for these things, make every effort to be found at peace, spotless and unblemished in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>And regard the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as also our dear brother Paul wrote to you, according to the wisdom that was given to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as he does also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which there are some things hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable distort to their own destruction, as they also do the rest of the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>Therefore, dear friends, because you know this beforehand, guard yourselves so that you do not lose your own safe position because you have been led away by the error of lawless persons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.</verse>
