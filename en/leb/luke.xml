  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Since many have attempted to compile an account concerning the events that have been fulfilled among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as those who were eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning passed on to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed best to me also—because I have followed all things carefully from the beginning—to write them down in orderly sequence for you, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you may know the certainty concerning the things about which you were taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>It happened that in the days of Herod, king of Judea, there was a certain priest, Zechariah by name, of the division of Abijah. And ˻he had a wife˼ from the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous in the sight of God, living blamelessly in all the commandments and regulations of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And ˻they did not have˼ a child, because Elizabeth was barren. And they were both advanced ˻in years˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it happened that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood he was chosen by lot to enter into the temple of the Lord to burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole crowd of the people were praying outside at the hour of the incense offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And Zechariah was terrified when he saw the angel, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him,“Do not be afraid, Zechariah,because your prayer has been heard,and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son,and you will call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And ˻you will experience joy and exultation˼,and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he will be great in the sight of the Lord,and he must never drink wine or beer,and he will be filled with the Holy Spiritwhile he is still in his mother’s womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he will turn many of the sons of Israelto the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he will go on before himin the spirit and power of Elijah,to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous,to prepare for the Lord a people made ready.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zechariah said to the angel, “By what will I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is advanced ˻in years˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered and said to him, “I am Gabriel, who stands in the presence of God, and I was sent to speak to you and to announce to you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And behold, you will be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, ˻because˼ you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people were waiting for Zechariah, and began to wonder when he was delayed in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out he was not able to speak to them, and they realized that he had seen a vision in the temple. And he kept making signs to them, and remained unable to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it happened that when the days of his service came to an end, he went away to his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>Now after these days, his wife Elizabeth conceived, and she kept herself in seclusion for five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>“Thus the Lord has done for me in the days in which he has concerned himself with me, to take away my disgrace among people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a town of Galilee ˻named˼ Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin legally promised in marriage to a man ˻named˼ Joseph of the house of David. And the name of the virgin was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But she was greatly perplexed at the statement, and was pondering what sort of greeting this might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her,“Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you will conceive in the womb and will give birth to a son,and you will call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>This one will be great, and he will be called the Son of the Most High,and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he will reign over the house of Jacob ˻forever˼,and of his kingdom there will be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>And Mary said to the angel, “How will this be, since I have not had sexual relations with a man?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said to her,“The Holy Spirit will come upon you,and the power of the Most High will overshadow you.Therefore also the one to be born will be called holy, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, your relative Elizabeth—she also has conceived a son in her old age, and this is the sixth month for her who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For ˻nothing will be impossible with God˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>So Mary said, “Behold, the Lord’s female slave! May it happen to me according to your word.” And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Now in those days Mary set out and traveled with haste into the hill country, to a town of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered into the house of Zechariah, and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it happened that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby in her womb leaped and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And she cried out with a loud shout and said,“Blessed are you among women,and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she who believed that there will be a fulfillment to what was spoken to her from the Lord!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said,“My soul exalts the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit has rejoiced greatly in God my Savior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>because he has looked upon the humble state of his female slave,for behold, from now on all generations will consider me blessed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>because the Mighty One has done great things for me,and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is for generation after generationto those who fear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has done a mighty deed with his arm;he has dispersed the proud in the thoughts of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has brought down rulers from their thrones,and has exalted the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled those who are hungry with good things,and those who are rich he has sent away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped Israel his servant,remembering his mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>just as he spoke to our fathers,to Abraham and to his descendants ˻forever˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary stayed with her about three months, and returned to her home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now the time came for Elizabeth that she should give birth, and she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbors and relatives heard that ˻the Lord had shown his great mercy to her˼, and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it happened that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child, and they were wanting to name him ˻after˼ his father Zechariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, “No, but he will be named John.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, “There is no one of your relatives who is called by this name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>So they made signs to his father asking what he wanted him to be named,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>and he asked for a writing tablet and wrote, saying, “John is his name.” And they were all astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth and his tongue were opened immediately, and he began to speak, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all those who lived near them, and in all the hill country of Judea all these events were discussed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all those who heard kept these things in their hearts, saying, “What then will this child be? For indeed the hand of the Lord was with him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel,because he has visited to help and ˻has redeemed˼ his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised up a horn of salvation for usin the house of his servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>just as he spoke through the mouth of his holy prophets from earliest times—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>salvation from our enemies and from the hand of all those who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to show mercy to our fathersand to remember his holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath that he swore to Abraham our father,to grant us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>that we, being rescued from the hand of our enemies,could serve him without fear</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousnessbefore him all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And so you, child, will be called the prophet of the Most High,for you will go on before the Lord to prepare his ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to his peopleby the forgiveness of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>because of the merciful compassion of our Godby which the dawn will visit to help us from on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death,to direct our feet into the way of peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child kept growing and becoming strong in spirit, and was in the wilderness until the day of his public appearance to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>Now it happened that in those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus to register all the empire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(This first registration took place when Quirinius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And everyone went to be registered, each one to his own town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>So Joseph also went up from Galilee, from the town of Nazareth, to Judea, to the city of David which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family line of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be registered together with Mary, who was legally promised in marriage to him and was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And it happened that while they were there, ˻the time came˼ for her to give birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she gave birth to her firstborn son, and wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were shepherds in the same region, living out of doors and keeping watch, guarding over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And an angel of the Lord stood near them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and ˻they were terribly frightened˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring good news to you of great joy which will be for all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>that today a Savior, who is Christ the Lord, was born for you in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this will be the sign for you: you will find the baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a manger.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly army, praising God and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>“Glory to God in the highest,and on earth peaceamong people ˻with whom he is pleased˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it happened that when the angels had departed from them into heaven, the shepherds began to say to one another, “Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has revealed to us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they went hurrying and found both Mary and Joseph, and the baby who was lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they saw it, they made known the statement that had been told to them about this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all who heard it were astonished concerning what had been said to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary treasured up all these words, pondering them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all that they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were completed ˻so that he could be circumcised˼, he was named Jesus, his name thathe was called by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of their purification were completed according to the law of Moses, they brought him up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(just as it is written in the law of the Lord, “Every male that opens the womb will be called holy to the Lord”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to what was stated in the law of the Lord, “a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem ˻whose name was˼ Simeon, and this man was righteous and devout, looking forward to the consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he would see the Lord’s Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came in the Spirit into the temple, and when the parents brought in the child Jesus so that they could do for him according to what was customary under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took him in his arms and praised God and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>“Now dismiss your slave in peace, Lord,according to your word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For my eyes have seen your salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>that you have prepared in the presence of all the peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for revelation to the Gentiles,and glory to your people Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And his father and mother were astonished at what was said about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them and said to his mother Mary, “Behold, this child is appointed for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign that is opposed—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>and a sword will pierce your own soul also, so that the thoughts of many hearts will be revealed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was a prophetess, Anna the daughter of Phanuel of the tribe of Asher (she was advanced ˻in years˼, having lived with her husband seven years ˻after her marriage˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and herself as a widow up to eighty-four years) who did not depart from the temple with fastings and prayers, serving night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And at that same hour she approached and began to give thanks to God, and to speak about him to all those who were waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had completed everything according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own town of Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child was growing and becoming strong, filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And his parents went every year to Jerusalem for the feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up according to the custom of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And after the days were completed, while they were returning, the boy Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. And his parents did not know it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>but believing him to be in the group of travelers, they went a day’s journey. And they began searching for him among their relatives and their acquantances,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>and when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem to search for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it happened that after three days they found him in the temple courts, sitting in the midst of the teachers and listening to them and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all who heard him were amazed at his insight and his answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him, they were astounded and his mother said to him, “Child, why have you done this to us? Look, your father and I have been searching for you anxiously!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them, “˻Why˼ were you searching for me? Did you not know that it was necessary for me to be in the house of my Father?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they did not understand the statement that he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was submitting to them. And his mother treasured all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus was advancing in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and with people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, and Herod was tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip was tetrarch of the region of Iturea and Trachonitis, and Lysanias was tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the time of the high priest Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zechariah in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he went into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah,“The voice of one crying out in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way of the Lord,make his paths straight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley will be filled,and every mountain and hill will be leveled,and the crooked will become straight,and the rough road will become smooth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh will see the salvation of God.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Therefore he was saying to the crowds that came out to be baptized by him, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentence! And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax is positioned at the root of the trees; therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>And the crowds were asking him, saying, “What then should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>And he answered and said to them, “The one who has two tunics must share with the one who does not have one, and the one who has food must do likewise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>And tax collectors also came to be baptized, and they said to him, “Teacher, what should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, “Collect no more than ˻what you are ordered to˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>And those who served in the army were also asking him, saying, “What should we also do?” And he said to them, “Extort from no one, and do not blackmail anyone, and be content with your pay.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>And while the people were waiting expectantly and all were pondering in their hearts concerning John, whether perhaps he might be the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John answered them all, saying, “I baptize you with water, but the one who is more powerful than I am is coming, of whom I am not worthy to untie the strap of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>His winnowing shovel is in his hand, to clean out his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his storehouse, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>So with many other exhortations also he proclaimed good news to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod the tetrarch, who had been reproved by him concerning Herodias, his brother’s wife, and concerning all the evil deeds that Herod had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>added this also to them all: he also locked up John in prison.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.3'>So the devil said to him, “If you are the Son of God, order this stone that it become bread!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>And he led him up and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And the devil said to him, “I will give you all this domain and their glory, because it has been handed over to me, and I can give it to whomever I want.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.7'>So if you will worship before me, all this will be yours.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.8'>And Jesus answered and said to him, “It is written, ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and serve only him.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.9'>And he brought him to Jerusalem, and had him stand on the highest point of the temple and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.15'>And he began to teach in their synagogues, and was praised by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.16'>And he came to Nazareth, where ˻he had been brought up˼, and according to ˻his custom˼ he entered into the synagogue on the day of the Sabbath and stood up to read.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.17'>And the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was given to him, and unrolling the scroll he found the place where it was written,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>And they stood up and forced him out of the town and brought him up to the edge of the hill on which their town was built, so that they could throw him down the cliff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But he passed through their midst and went on his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>And he came down to Capernaum, a town of Galilee, and was teaching them on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were astounded at his teaching, because ˻he spoke˼ with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>And in the synagogue there was a man who had the spirit of an unclean demon, and he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent and come out of him!” And after throwing him down in their midst, the demon came out of him without hurting him at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And amazement came upon them all, and they began to talk with one another, saying, “What word is this? For he commands the unclean spirits with authority and power, and they come out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And news about him went out into every place of the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And after he set out from the synagogue, he went into Simon’s house. And Simon’s mother-in-law was afflicted with a high fever, and they asked him on behalf of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>And he stood over her and rebuked the fever, and it left her. And immediately she got up and began to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>Now as the sun was setting, all who had those who were sick with various diseases brought them to him, and placing his hands on every one of them, he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And demons also were coming out of many, crying out and saying, “You are the Son of God!” And he rebuked themand did not permit them to speak, because they knew that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>And when it was day, he departed and went to an isolated place. And the crowds were seeking him, and came to him and were trying to prevent him from departing from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>But he said to them, “It is necessary for me to proclaim the good news of the kingdom of God to the other towns also, because I was sent for this purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.44'>And he was preaching in the synagogues of Judea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Now it happened that while the crowd was pressing around him and hearing the word of God, he was standing beside the lake of Gennesaret,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>and he saw two boats there beside the lake, but the fishermen had gotten out of them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>And he got into one of the boats, which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out from the land a little. And he sat down and began to teach the crowds from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>And when he stopped speaking, he said to Simon, “Put out into the deep water and let down your nets for a catch.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>And Simon answered and said, “Master, although we worked hard through the whole night, we caught nothing. But at your word I will let down the nets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they did this, they caught a very large number of fish, and their nets began to tear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>And they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them, and they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>And when he saw it, Simon Peter fell down at Jesus’ knees, saying, “Depart from me, Lord, because I am ˻a sinful man˼!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>For amazement had seized him and all those who were with him at the catch of fish that they had caught,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>and so also were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were business partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, “Do not be afraid! From now on you will be catching people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And after they brought their boats to the land, they left everything and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it happened that while he was in one of the towns, ˻there was˼ a man ˻covered with leprosy˼. And when he saw Jesus, he fell down on his face and begged him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>And extending his hand he touched him, saying, “I am willing; be clean.” And immediately the leprosy went away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And he ordered him, “Tell no one, but go and show yourself to the priest and bring the offering for your cleansing just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the report about him spread even more, and large crowds were gathering to hear him and to be healed of their illnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But he himself was withdrawing in the wilderness and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>And it happened that on one of the days as he was teaching, Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there who ˻had come˼ from every village of Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem, and the power of the Lord was there in order for him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men came carrying on a stretcher a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and place him before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they did not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down through the roof tiles with the stretcher into the midst of them, in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And when he saw their faith, he said, “Friend, your sins are forgiven you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, “Who is this man who speaks blasphemies? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, answered and said to them, “Why are you reasoning in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>Which is easier to say, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,” he said to the one who was paralyzed, “I say to you, ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and go to your home.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>And immediately he stood up before them, picked up what he had been lying on, and went away to his home, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>And amazement seized them all, and they began to glorify God. And they were filled with fear, saying, “We have seen wonderful things today!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>And after these things, he went out and saw a tax collector ˻named˼ Levi sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>And leaving everything behind, he got up and began to follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>And Levi gave a great banquet for him in his house, and there was a large crowd of tax collectors and others who were reclining for the meal with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Pharisees and their scribes began to complain to his disciples, saying, “Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>And Jesus answered and said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those ˻who are sick˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>I have not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentence.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>And they said to him, “The disciples of John fast often and make prayers—likewise also the disciples of the Pharisees—but yours are eating and drinking!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>So Jesus said to them, “You are not able to make the ˻bridegroom’s attendants˼ fast as long as the bridegroom is with them, are you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>But days will come, and when the bridegroom is taken away from them, then they will fast in those days.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>And he also told a parable to them: “No one tears a patch from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise, he will have torn the new also, and the old will not match the patch that is from the new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. Otherwise, the new wine will burst the wineskins, and it will be spilled and the wineskins will be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>But new wine must be put into new wineskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.39'>And no one after drinking old wine wants new, because he says, ‘The old is just fine!’ ”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.6'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.1'>Now it happened that on a Sabbath he went through the grain fields, and his disciples were picking and eating the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.2'>But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>And Jesus answered and said to them, “Have you not read this, what David did when he and those who were with him were hungry—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>how he entered into the house of God and took the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests alone), and ate it and gave it to those with him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.5'>And he said to them, “The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.6'>Now it happened that on another Sabbath he entered into the synagogue and was teaching, and a man was there, and his right hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.7'>So the scribes and the Pharisees were watching him closely to see if he would heal on the Sabbath, in order that they could find a reason to accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.8'>But he knew their thoughts and said to the man who had the withered hand, “Get up and stand in the middle,” and he got up and stood there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.9'>And Jesus said to them, “I ask you whether it is permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save a life or to destroy it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.10'>And after looking around at them all, he said to him, “Stretch out your hand,” and he did, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.11'>But they were filled with fury, and began discussing with one another what they might do to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.12'>Now it happened that in these days he went away to the mountain to pray, and was spending the whole night in prayer to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.13'>And when day came, he summoned his disciples and chose from them twelve, whom he also named apostles:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.16'>and Judas the son of James, and Judas Iscariot, who became a traitor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.17'>And he came down with them and stood on a level place, and a large crowd of his disciples and a great multitude of people from all of Judea and Jerusalem and the seacoast district of Tyre and Sidon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.18'>who came to hear him and to be healed of their diseases, and those who were troubled by unclean spirits were cured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.19'>And the whole crowd was seeking to touch him, because power was going out from him and healing them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.20'>And he lifted up his eyes to his disciples and said,“Blessed are the poor,because yours is the kingdom of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.47'>“Everyone who comes to me and listens to my words and does them—I will show you what he is like:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.48'>he is like a man building a house, who dug and went down deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood came, the river burst against that house and was not able to shake it, because it had been built well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.49'>But the one who hears my words and does not do them is like a man who built a house on the ground without a foundation, which the river burst against, and immediately it collapsed—and the collapse of that house was great!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.7'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.1'>After he had finished all his statements in the hearing of the people, he entered into Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.2'>Now a certain centurion’s slave, who was esteemed by him, ˻was sick˼and was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.3'>So when he heard about Jesus, he sent Jewish elders to him, asking him that he would come and cure his slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.4'>And when they came to Jesus, they began imploring him earnestly, saying, “He is worthy that you grant this for him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.5'>because he loves our nation and he himself built the synagogue for us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>So Jesus went with them. Now by this time he was not far away from the house, and the centurion sent friends, saying to him, “Lord, do not trouble yourself, for I am not worthy that you should come in under my roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.7'>For this reason neither did I consider myself worthy to come to you. But say the word and my slave must be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.8'>For I also am a man placed under authority, who has soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go!’ and he goes, and to another one, ‘Come!’ and he comes, and to my slave, ‘Do this!’ and he does it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.9'>And when Jesus heard these things, he marveled at him, and turning around to the crowd that was following him, he said, “I tell you, not even in Israel have I found such great faith!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>And when they returned to the house, those who had been sent found the slave healthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>And it happened that on the next day he went to a town called Nain, and his disciples and a large crowd went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>And as he approached the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, his mother’s only son, and she was a widow. And a large crowd from the town was with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion for her and said to her, “Do not weep!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>And he came up and touched the bier, and those who were carrying it stopped. And he said, “Young man, I say to you, get up!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>And the dead man sat up and began to speak, and he gave him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>And fear seized them all, and they began to glorify God, saying, “A great prophet has appeared among us!” and “God has visited to help his people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>And this report about him went out in the whole of Judea and in all the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>And his disciples reported to John about all these things. And summoning a certain two of his disciples, John</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>sent them to the Lord, saying, “Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>And when the men came to him, they said, “John the Baptist sent us to you, saying, ‘Are you the one who is to come, or should we look for another?’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>In that hour he healed many people of diseases and suffering and evil spirits, and he granted sight to many blind people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>And he answered and said to them, “Go and tell John what you have seen and heard: the blind receive sight, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear; the dead are raised, the poor have good news announced to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>And whoever is not offended by me is blessed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>And when the messengers of John had departed, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are in splendid clothing and luxury are in the royal palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.26'>But what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.27'>It is this man about whom it is written:‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way before you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.28'>I tell you, there is no one greater among those born of women than John, but the one who is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>(And all the people, when they heard this—even the tax collectors—affirmed the righteousness of God, because they had been baptized with the baptism of John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>but the Pharisees and the legal experts rejected the purpose of God for themselves, because they had not been baptized by him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>“To what then shall I compare the people of this generation, and what are they like?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children sitting in the marketplace and calling out to one another, who say,‘We played the flute for you and you did not dance;we sang a lament and you did not weep.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.33'>For John the Baptist has come not eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, ‘He has a demon!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.34'>The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, ‘Behold, a man who is a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.35'>And wisdom is vindicated by all her children.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>Now one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him, and he entered into the house of the Pharisee and reclined at the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>And behold, a woman in the town who was a sinner, when she learned that he was dining in the Pharisee’s house, brought an alabaster flask of perfumed oil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>and standing behind him at his feet weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears and was wiping them with the hair of her head and was kissing his feet and anointing them with the perfumed oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>Now when the Pharisee who invited him saw this, he spoke to himself, saying, “If this man were a prophet, he would have known who and what kind of woman this is who is touching him, that she is a sinner.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>And Jesus answered and said to him, “Simon, I have something to say to you.” And he said, “Teacher, say it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.41'>“There were two debtors who owed a certain creditor. One owed five hundred denarii and the other fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.42'>When they were not able to repay him, he forgave the debts of both. Now which of them will love him more?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.43'>Simon answered and said, “I suppose that it is the one to whom he forgave more.” And he said to him, “You have judged correctly.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>And turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered into your house. You did not give me water for my feet, but she wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.45'>You did not give me a kiss, but from the time I entered, she has not stopped kissing my feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.46'>You did not anoint my head with olive oil, but she anointed my feet with perfumed oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.47'>˻For this reason˼ I tell you, her sins—which were many—have been forgiven, for she loved much. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.48'>And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.49'>And those who were reclining at the table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this who even forgives sins?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.50'>And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.8'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it happened that ˻afterward˼ also he was going about from one town and village to another preaching and proclaiming the good news concerning the kingdom of God, and the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>and some women who had been healed of evil spirits and diseases: Mary (who was called Magdalene), from whom seven demons had gone out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>and Joanna the wife of Chuza (Herod’s household manager), and Susanna, and many others who were helping to support them from their possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And while a large crowd was gathering and they were going to him from town after town, he spoke by means of a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>“The sower went out to sow his seed, and while he was sowing, ˻some seed˼ fell on the side of the path and was trampled under foot, and the birds of the sky devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And other seed fell on the rock, and when it came up, it withered, because it did not have moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And other seed fell in the midst of the thorn plants, and the thorn plants grew up with itand choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other seed fell on the good soil, and when it came up, it produced a hundred times as much grain.” As he said these things, he called out, “The one who has ears to hear, let him hear!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him what this parable meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, “To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest they are in parables, so that‘Seeing they may not see,and hearing they may not understand.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable means this: the seed is the word of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>and those beside the path are the ones who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes away the word from their heart, so that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>And those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy when they hear it, and these do not have enough root, who believe for a time and in a time of testing fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And the seed that fell into the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear and as they go along are choked by the worries and riches and pleasures of life, and they do not bear fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But the seed on the good soil—these are the ones who, after hearing the word, hold fast to it with a noble and good heart, and bear fruit with patient endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>“And no one, after lighting a lamp, covers it with a jar or puts it under a bed, but puts it on a lampstand, so that those who come in can see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>For nothing is secret that will not become evident, and nothing hidden that will never be known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>Therefore consider how you listen, for whoever has, to him more will be given, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks that he has will be taken away from him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>Now his mother and brothers came to him, and they were not able to meet with him because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>And it was reported to him, “Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wanting to see you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>But he answered and said to them, “These are my mother and my brothers—the ones who hear the word of God and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it happened that on one of the days both he and his disciples got into a boat, and he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side of the lake.” And they set sail,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>and as they were sailing, he fell asleep. And a storm of wind came down on the lake, and they were being swamped and were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>And they came and woke him up, saying, “Master, master! We are perishing!” So he got up and rebuked the wind and the billowing waves of water and they ceased, and it became calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>And he said to them, “Where is your faith?” But they were afraid and were astonished, saying to one another, “Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water and they obey him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>And they sailed to the region of the Gerasenes, which is opposite Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>And as he got out on the land, a certain man from the town met him who had demons and for a considerable time had not worn clothes and did not live in a house, but among the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>And when he saw Jesus, he cried out, fell down before him, and said with a loud voice, “˻What do I have to do with you˼, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you, do not torment me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. (For it had seized him many times, and he was bound with chains and shackles and was guarded, and breaking the bonds he would be driven by the demon into the deserted places.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>So Jesus asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Legion,” because many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And they began imploring him that he would not order them to depart into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there on the hill, and they implored him that he would permit them to enter into those pigs. And he permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>So the demons came out of the man and entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed headlong down the steep slope into the lake and were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And when the herdsmen saw what had happened, they fled and reported it in the town and in the countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>So they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting there clothed and in his right mind, at the feet of Jesus, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And those who had seen it reported to them how the man who had been demon-possessed had been healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>And all the people of the surrounding region of the Gerasenes asked him to depart from them, because they had been seized with great fear. So he got into the boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>And the man from who the demons had gone out was begging him to stay with him, but he sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>“Return to your home and tell all that God has done for you.” And he went away, proclaiming throughout the whole town all that Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>Now when Jesus returned, the crowd welcomed him, because they were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, a man ˻who was named˼ Jairus came, and this man was a ruler of the synagogue. And he fell down at the feet of Jesus and began imploring him to come to his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>because ˻he had˼ an only daughter, about twelve years old, and she was dying.Now as he was going, the crowds were pressing against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>And a woman who was ˻suffering from hemorrhages˼ for twelve years (who, although she had spent all her assets on physicians, was not able to be healed by anyone)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>came up behind himand touched the edge of his cloak, and immediately ˻her hemorrhaging˼ stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, “Who is the one who touched me?” And when they all denied it, Peter said, “Master, the crowds are pressing you hard and crowding you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, “Someone touched me, because I know power has gone out from me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>And when the woman saw that she did not escape notice, she came trembling and falling down before him. In the presence of all the people, she told for what reason she had touched him, and that she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go in peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue ruler’s house, saying, “Your daughter is dead! Trouble the Teacher no longer!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But Jesus, when he heard this, replied to him, “Do not be afraid! Only believe, and she will be healed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>Now when he came to the house, he did not allow anyone to enter with him except Peter and John and James and the father and mother of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>And they were all weeping and mourning for her, but he said, “Do not weep! For she is not dead, but is sleeping.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they began laughing at him, because they knew that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But he took her hand and called, saying, “Child, get up.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>And her spirit returned, and she got up immediately, and he ordered something to be given to her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were astonished, but he ordered them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>And summoning the twelve, he gave them power and authority over all the demons and to cure diseases,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>and he sent them out to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And he said to them, “Take along nothing for the journey—neither a staff, nor a traveler’s bag, nor bread, nor money, nor to have two tunics apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>And into whatever house you enter, stay there and depart from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And as for all those who do not welcome you—when you depart from that town, shake off the dust from your feet for a testimony against them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>So they departed and went throughout the villages, proclaiming the good news and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard about all that was happening, and he was greatly perplexed, because it was said by some that John has been raised from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and by some that Elijah had appeared, and others that some prophet of ancient times had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, “John I beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?” And he was wanting to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>And when they returned, the apostles described to him all that they had done. And he took them along and withdrew privately to a town called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But when the crowds found out, they followed him, and welcoming them, he began to speak to them about the kingdom of God, and he cured those who had need of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>Now the day began to be far spent, and the twelve came up and said to him, “Send away the crowd so that they can go into the surrounding villages and farms to obtain lodging and find provisions, because we are here in a desolate place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But he said to them, “You give them something to eat!” And they said, “˻We have no˼ more than five loaves and two fish, unless perhaps we go and purchase food for all these people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>(For there were about five thousand men.) So he said to his disciples, “Have them sit down in groups of about fifty each.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and had them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke them and began giving them to the disciples to set before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>And they all ate and were satisfied, and what was left over was picked up by them—twelve baskets of broken pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>And it happened that while he was praying alone, the disciples were with him. And he asked them, saying, “Who do the crowds say that I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>And they answered and said, “John the Baptist, but others, Elijah, and others, that one of the ancient prophets has risen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>And he said to them, “But who do you say that I am?” And Peter answered and said, “The Christ of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>But he warned and commanded them to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, “It is necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>And he said to them all, “If anyone wants to come after me, he must deny himself and take up his cross every day and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life on account of me, this person will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>For what is a person benefited if he gains the whole world but loses or forfeits himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of this person when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you truly, there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>Now it happened that about eight days after these words, he took along Peter and John and James and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And as he was praying, the appearance of his face became different, and his clothing became white, gleaming like lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And behold, two men were talking with him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appeared in glory and were speaking about his departure which he was about to fulfill in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Now Peter and those with him were ˻very sleepy˼, but when they became fully awake, they saw his glory and the two men who were standing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it happened that as they were going away from him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here. And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah,” not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>And while he was saying these things, a cloud came and overshadowed them, and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came from the cloud, saying, “This is my Son, my Chosen One. Listen to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And after the voice had occurred, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and told no one in those days anything of what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>Now it happened that on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, “Teacher, I beg you to look with concern on my son, because he is my only son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And behold, a spirit seizes him and suddenly he screams, and it convulses him with foam and rarely withdraws from him, battering him severely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I begged your disciples that they would expel it, and they were not able to do so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>So Jesus answered and said, “O unbelieving and perverted generation! ˻How long˼ will I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And while he was still approaching, the demon threw him down and convulsed him. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit and healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all astounded at the impressiveness of God.But while they were all marveling at all the things that he was doing, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>“˻You take these words to heart˼, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this statement, and it was concealed from them so that they could not understand it. And they were afraid to ask him about this statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>And an argument developed among them as to who of them might be greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus, because he knew the thoughts of their hearts, took hold of a child and had him stand beside him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, “Whoever welcomes this child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me. For the one who is least among you all—this one is great.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And John answered and said, “Master, we saw someone expelling demons in your name, and we tried to prevent him, because he does not follow in company with us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said to him, “Do not prevent him, because whoever is not against you is for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>Now it happened that when the days were approaching ˻for him to be taken up˼, he set his face to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>And he sent messengers before ˻him˼, and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans in order to prepare for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>And they did not welcome him because ˻he was determined to go˼ to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>Now when the disciples James and John saw it, they said, “Lord, do you want us to call fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned around and rebuked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>and they proceeded to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And as they were traveling on the road, someone said to him, “I will follow you wherever you go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, “Foxes have dens and birds of the sky have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to lay his head.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, first allow me to go and bury my father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>But he said to him, “Leave the dead to bury their own dead! But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another person also said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to say farewell to those in my house.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, “No one who puts his hand on the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>And after these things, the Lord appointed seventy-two others and sent them out two by two before ˻him˼ into every town and place where he was about to go.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Jesus replied and said, “A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell into the hands of robbers, who both stripped him and beat him. After inflicting blows on him, they went away, leaving him half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>Now by coincidence a certain priest was going down on that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>And he came up and bandaged his wounds, pouring on olive oil and wine, and he put him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>And on the next day, he took out and gave two denarii to the innkeeper, and said, “Take care of him, and whatever you spend in addition, I will repay to you when I return.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.14'>Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, heard all these things, and they ridiculed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.15'>And he said to them, “You are the ones who justify themselves in the sight of men, but God knows your hearts! For what isconsidered exalted among men is an abomination in the sight of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.22'>Now it happened that the poor man died, and he was carried away by the angels to ˻Abraham’s side˼. And the rich man also died and was buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.23'>And in Hades he lifted up his eyes as he was in torment and saw Abraham from a distance, and Lazarus ˻at his side˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.24'>And he called out and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he could dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am suffering pain in this flame!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.25'>But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you received your good things during your life, and Lazarus likewise bad things. But now he is comforted here, but you are suffering pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.26'>And in addition to all these things, a great chasm has been established between us and you, so that those who want to cross over from here to you are not able to do so, nor can they cross over from there to us.’</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.18'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.1'>And he told them a parable to show that they must always pray and not be discouraged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.2'>saying, “There was a certain judge in a certain town who did not fear God and did not respect people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.3'>And there was a widow in that town, and she kept coming to him, saying, ‘Grant me justice against my adversary!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.4'>And he was not willing for a time, but after these things he said to himself, ‘Even if I do not fear God or respect people,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.6'>And the Lord said, “Listen to what the unrighteous judge is saying!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.7'>And will not God surely ˻see to it that justice is done˼ to his chosen ones who cry out to him day and night, and will he delay toward them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.8'>I tell you that ˻he will see to it that justice is done˼ for them soon! Nevertheless, when the Son of Man comes, then will he find faith on earth?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.9'>And he also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and looked down on ˻everyone else˼:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.10'>“Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.11'>The Pharisee stood and prayed these things with reference to himself: ‘God, I give thanks to you that I am not like other people—swindlers, unrighteous people, adulterers, or even like this tax collector!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.12'>I fast twice a week; I give a tenth of all that I get.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>But the tax collector, standing far away, did not want even to raise his eyes to heaven, but was beating his breast, saying, ‘God, be merciful to me, a sinner!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than that one! For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the one who humbles himself will be exalted.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.15'>Now they were bringing even their babies to him so that he could touch them. But when the disciples saw it, they rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.16'>But Jesus called them to himself, saying, “Allow the children to come to me, and do not forbid them, ˻for to such belongs˼ the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.17'>Truly I say to you, whoever does not welcome the kingdom of God like a young child will never enter into it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.18'>And a certain ruler asked him, saying, “Good Teacher, by doing what will I inherit eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.19'>And Jesus said to him, “Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.20'>You know the commandments: ‘Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal, do not give false testimony, honor your father and mother.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.21'>And he said, “All these I have observed from my youth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.22'>And when he heard this, Jesus said to him, “˻You still lack one thing˼: Sell all that you have, and distribute the proceeds to the poor—and you will have treasure in heaven—and come, follow me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.23'>But when he heard these things he became very sad, because he was extremely wealthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.24'>And when Jesus saw him becoming very sad, he said, “How ˻difficult it is for˼ those who possess wealth to enter into the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.25'>For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter into the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.26'>So those who heard this said, “And who can be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.27'>But he said, “What is impossible with men is possible with God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.28'>And Peter said, “Behold, we have left ˻all that is ours˼and followed you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.29'>And he said to them, “Truly I say to you that there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children on account of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.30'>who will not receive many times more in this time and in the age to come, eternal life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.31'>And taking aside the twelve, he said to them, “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and all the things that are written by the prophets with reference to the Son of Man will be accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.32'>For he will be handed over to the Gentiles and will be mocked and mistreated and spit on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.33'>and after flogging him they will kill him, and on the third day he will rise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.34'>And they understood none of these things, and this saying was concealed from them, and they did not comprehend the things that were said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.35'>Now it happened that as he drew near to Jericho, a certain blind man was sitting on the side of the road begging.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.36'>And when he heard a crowd going by, he inquired what this meant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.37'>And they told him, “Jesus the Nazarene is passing by.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.38'>And he called out, saying, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>And those who were in front rebuked him, that he should be silent, but he cried out ˻even more loudly˼, “Son of David, have mercy on me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>So Jesus stopped and ordered him to be brought to him. And when he approached, he asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>“What do you want me to do for you?” And he said, “Lord, that I may regain my sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>And Jesus said to him, “Regain your sight! Your faith has saved you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>And immediately he regained his sight and began to follow him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw it, gave praise to God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>And he entered and traveled through Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>And ˻there was˼ a man ˻named˼ Zacchaeus, and he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>And he was seeking to see Jesus—who he was—and he was not able to as a result of the crowd, because he was short in stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>And he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree so that he could see him, because he was going to go through that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when he came to the place, Jesus looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, come down quickly, because it is necessary for me to stay at your house today!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>And he came down quickly and welcomed him joyfully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>And when they saw it, they all began to complain, saying, “He has gone in to find lodging with a man who is a sinner!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>And Zacchaeus stopped and said to the Lord, “Behold, half of my possessions, Lord, I am giving to the poor, and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I am paying it back four times as much!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>For the Son of Man came to seek and to save those who are lost.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>Now while they were listening to these things, he went on and told a parable, because he was near Jerusalem and they thought that the kingdom of God was going to appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>Therefore he said, “A certain nobleman traveled to a distant country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>And summoning ten of his own slaves, he gave them ten minas and said to them, ‘Do business ˻until I come back˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, ‘We do not want this man to be king over us!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>And it happened that when he returned after receiving the kingdom, he ordered these slaves to whom he had given the money to be summoned to him, so that he could know what they had gained by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>So the first arrived, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made ten minas more!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>And he said to him, ‘Well done, good slave! Because you have been faithful in a very small thing, ˻have authority˼ over ten cities.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second came, saying, ‘Sir, your mina has made five minas.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>So he said to this one also, ‘And you be over five cities.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>And another came, saying, ‘Sir, behold your mina, which I had put away for safekeeping in a piece of cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>For I was afraid of you, because you are a severe man—you withdraw what you did not deposit, and you reap what you did not sow!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>He said to him, ‘˻By your own words˼ I will judge you, wicked slave! You knew that I am a severe man, withdrawing what I did not deposit and reaping what I did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>And why did you not give my money to the bank, and I, when I returned, would have collected it with interest?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>And to the bystanders he said, ‘Take away from him the mina and give it to the one who has the ten minas!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>And they said to him, ‘Sir, he has ten minas.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>‘I tell you that to everyone who has, more will be given. But from the one who does not have, even what he has will be taken away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>And after he had said these things, he traveled on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>And it happened that when he drew near to Bethphage and Bethany, to the hill called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, ‘Go into the village in front of you, in which as you enter you will find a colt tied, on which ˻no person has ever˼ sat, and untie it and bring it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>And if anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ you will say this: ‘The Lord has need of it.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent went and found it just as he had told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>And as they were untying the colt, its owners said to them, ‘Why are you untying the colt?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>So they said, ‘The Lord has need of it.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>And they brought it to Jesus, and throwing their cloaks on the colt, they put Jesus on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as he was going along, they were spreading out their cloaks on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>Now as he was drawing near by this time to the descent from the Mount of Olives, the whole crowd of the disciples began rejoicing to praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles that they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying,“Blessed is the king,the one who comes in the name of the Lord!Peace in heavenand glory in the highest!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>And some of the Pharisees from the crowd said to him, “Teacher, rebuke your disciples!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>And he answered and said, “I tell you, if these keep silent, the stones will cry out!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And when he approached and saw the city, he wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, “If you had known on this day—even you—the things that make for peace! But now they are hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>For days will come upon you and your enemies will put up an embankment against you, and will surround you and press you hard from all directions.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>And he entered into the temple courtsand began to drive out those who were selling,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>saying to them, “It is written, ‘And my house will be a house of prayer,’ but you have made it a cave of robbers!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And he was teaching every day in the temple courts, and the chief priests and the scribes and the most prominent men of the people were seeking to destroy him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And it happened that on one of the days while he was teaching the people in the temple courts and proclaiming the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes approached together with the elders</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>And he answered and said to them, “I also will ask you a question, and you tell me:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said to them, “Neither will I tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>And he began to tell the people this parable: “A certain man planted a vineyard, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the proper time he sent a slave to the tenant farmers, so that they would give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the tenant farmers sent him away empty-handed after beating him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And he proceeded to send another slave, but they beat and dishonored that one also, and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And he proceeded to send a third, but they wounded and threw out this one also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>So the owner of the vineyard said, ‘What should I do? I will send my beloved son; perhaps they will respect him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the tenant farmers saw him, they began to reason with one another, saying, ‘This is the heir. Let us kill him so that the inheritance will become ours!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.” And when they heard this, they said, “May this never happen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>But he looked intently at them and said, “What then is this that is written:‘The stone which the builders rejected,this has become ˻the cornerstone˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and the one on whom it falls—it will crush him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the scribes and the chief priests sought to lay their hands on him at that same hour, and they were afraid of the people, for they knew that he had told this parable with reference to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended they were upright, in order that they could catch him in a statement, so that they could hand him over to the authority and the jurisdiction of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying, “Teacher, we know that you speak and teach rightly, and do not ˻show partiality˼, but teach the way of God in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it permitted for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But seeing through their craftiness, he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>“Show me a denarius! Whose image and inscription does it have?” And they said, “Caesar’s.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>So he said to them, “Well then, give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they were not able to catch him in a statement in the sight of the people, and astonished at his answer, they became silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Now some of the Sadducees—who deny ˻that there is a resurrection˼—came up and asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying, “Teacher, Moses wrote for us if someone’s brother dies having a wife, and this man is childless, that his brother should take the wife and ˻father˼ descendants for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers, and the first took a wife and died childless,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>and the second,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>and the third took her, and likewise also the seven did not leave children and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Finally the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore in the resurrection, the woman—whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus said to them, “The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>but those who are considered worthy to attain to that age and to the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>for they are not even able to die any longer, because they are like the angels and are sons of God, because they are sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>But that the dead are raised, even Moses revealed in the passage about the bush, when he calls the Lord the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>Now he is not God of the dead, but of the living, for all live to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>And some of the scribes answered and said, “Teacher, you have spoken well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>For they no longer dared to ask him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>But he said to them, “In what sense do they say that the Christ is David’s son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>For David himself says in the book of Psalms,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>until I make your enemiesa footstool for your feet.” ’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And while all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>“Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and who love greetings in the marketplaces and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>And he looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the contribution box,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>and he saw a certain poor widow putting in there two small copper coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>And he said, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>For these all put gifts into the offering out of their abundance, but this woman out of her poverty put in all the means of subsistence that she had.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>And Satan entered into Judas, the one called Iscariot, who was of the number of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers of the temple guard how he could betray him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were delighted, and came to an agreement with him to give him money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>And he agreed, and began looking for a favorable opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>And the day of the feast of Unleavened Bread came, on which it was necessary for the Passover lamb to be sacrificed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>And he sent Peter and John, saying, “Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>So they said to him, “Where do you want us to prepare it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>And he said to them, “Behold, when you have entered into the city, a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him into the house which he enters.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>So they went and found everything just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>And when the hour came, he reclined at the table, and the apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>And he said to them, “˻I have earnestly desired˼ to eat this Passover with you before I suffer.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>And he took in hand a cup, andafter giving thanks he said, “Take this and share it among yourselves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>But he said to him, “Lord, I am ready to go with you both to prison and to death!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>And a certain female slave, seeing him sitting in the light and looking intently at him, said, “This man also was with him!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And after a short time another person saw him and said, “You also are one of them!” But Peter said, “Man, I am not!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And he went outside and wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>And the men who were guarding him began to mock him while they beat him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>and after blindfolding him they repeatedly asked him, saying, “Prophesy! Who is the one who struck you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And they were saying many other things against him, reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>And when day came, the council of elders of the people gathered, both chief priests and scribes, and they led him away to their Sanhedrin,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and the scribes were standing there vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod with his soldiers also treated him with contempt, and after mocking himand dressing himin glistening clothing, he sent him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And both Herod and Pilate became friends with one another on that same day, ˻for they had previously been enemies of one another˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>So Pilate called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>and said to them, “You brought me this man as one who was misleading the people, and behold, when I examined him before you, I found nothing in this man as basis for the accusation which ˻you are making˼ against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>But neither did Herod, because he sent him back to us. And behold, nothing deserving death ˻has been done˼ by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>Therefore I will punish him and release him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they all cried out in unison, saying, “Take this man away, and release for us Barabbas!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(who had been thrown in prison because of a certain insurrection that had taken place in the city, and for murder).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>And Pilate, wanting to release Jesus, addressed them again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>but they kept crying out, saying, “Crucify! Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>So he said to them a third time, “Why? What wrong has this man done? I found no basis for an accusation ˻deserving death˼ in him. Therefore I will punish him and release him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were urgent, demanding with loud cries that he be crucified. And their cries prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate decided that their demand should be granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released the one who had been thrown into prison because of insurrection and murder, whom they were asking for, but Jesus he handed over to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, they seized Simon, a certain man of Cyrene, who was coming from the country, and placed the cross on him, to carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great crowd of the people were following him, and of women who were mourning and lamenting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But turning to them, Jesus said, “Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold, days are coming in which they will say, ‘Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that did not give birth, and the breasts that did not nurse!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin to say to the mountains, ‘Fall on us!’ and to the hills, ‘Cover us!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things˻when the wood is green˼, what will happen ˻when it is dry˼?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And two other criminals were also led away to be executed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place that is called “The Skull,” there they crucified him, and the criminals, the one on his right and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>〚But Jesus said, “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing.”〛 And they cast lots to divide his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood there watching, but the rulers also ridiculed him, saying, “He saved others; let him save himself, if this man is the Christ of God, the Chosen One!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming up and offering him sour wine</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, “If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And there was also an inscription over him, “This is the king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the criminals who were hanged there reviled him, saying, “Are you not the Christ? Save yourself—and us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answered and rebuked him, saying, “Do you not even fear God, because you are undergoing the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving ˻what we deserve˼for what we have done. But this man has done nothing wrong!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said, “Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And he said to him, “Truly I say to you, today you will be with me in paradise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And by this time it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>becausethe light of the sun failed. And the curtain of the temple was torn apart down the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, “Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit!” And after he said this, he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now when the centurion saw what had happened, he began to praise God, saying, “Certainly this man was righteous!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowds that had come together for this spectacle, when they saw the things that had happened, returned home beating their breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintances, and the women who had followed him from Galilee who saw these things, stood at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold, a man ˻named˼ Joseph, who was a member of the council and a good and righteous man</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(this man was not consenting to their plan and deed), from Arimathea, ˻a Judean town˼, who was looking forward to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man approached Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down and wrapped it in a linen cloth and placed him in a tomb cut into the rock where no one had ever been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And it was the day of preparation, and the Sabbath was drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women who had been accompanying him from Galilee followed and saw the tomb and how his body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned and prepared fragrant spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>Now on the first day of the week, at very early dawn, they came back to the tomb bringing the fragrant spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone had been rolled away from the tomb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>but when they went in, they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it happened that while they were perplexed about this, behold, two men in gleaming clothing stood near them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were terrified and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, “Why are you looking for the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but has been raised! Remember how he spoke to you while he was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying that the Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of men who are sinners, and be crucified, and on the third day rise?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and when they returned from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Now Mary Magdalene and Joanna and Mary the mother of James and the others with them were telling these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And these words appeared to them as nonsense, and they refused to believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter got up and ran to the tomb, and bending over to look, he saw only the strips of linen cloth, and he went away to his home wondering what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And behold, on that same day, two of them were traveling to a village ˻named˼ Emmaus that was sixty stadia distant from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>and they were conversing with one another about all these things that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it happened that while they were conversing, and discussing, Jesus himself also approached and began to go along with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, “What are these matters that you are discussing with one another as you are walking along?” And they stood still, looking sad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, ˻named˼ Cleopas, answered and said to him, “Are you the only one living near Jerusalem and not knowing the things that have happened in it in these days?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, “What things?” So they said to him, “The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, a man who was a prophet, powerful in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how our chief priests and rulers handed him over to a sentence of death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. But in addition to all these things, this is the third day ˻since˼ these things took place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>But also some women from among us astonished us, who were at the tomb early in the morning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and when they did not find his body, they came back saying they had seen even a vision of angels, who said that he was alive!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And some of those with us went out to the tomb and found it like this, just as the women had also said, but him they did not see.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And he said to them, “O foolish and slow in heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Was it not necessary that the Christ suffer these things and enter into his glory?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, he interpreted to them the things concerning himself in all the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near to the village where they were going, and he acted as though he was going farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>And they urged him strongly, saying, “Stay with us, because it is getting toward evening, and by this time the day is far spent.” And he went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it happened that when he reclined at the table with them, he took the bread and gave thanks, and after breaking it, he gave it to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they recognized him, and he became invisible to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to one another, “Were not our hearts burning within us while he was speaking with us on the road, while he was explaining the scriptures to us?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they got up that same hour and returned to Jerusalem and found the eleven and those with them assembled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, “The Lord has really been raised, and has appeared to Simon!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they began describing ˻what happened˼ on the road, and how he was recognized by them in the breaking of the bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And while they were saying these things, he himself stood there among them and said to them, “Peace to you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were startled and became terrified, and thought they had seen a ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, “Why are you frightened? And for what reason do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Look at my hands and my feet, that I am I myself! Touch me and see, because a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as ˻you see that I have˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they were still disbelieving because of joy and were marveling, he said to them, “Do you have anything ˻to eat˼ here?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>So they gave him a piece of broiled fish,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>and he took itand ate it in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, “These are my words that I spoke to you while I was still with you, that everything that is written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and psalms must be fulfilled.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>and said to them, “Thus it is written that the Christ would suffer and would rise from the dead on the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and repentance for the forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>You are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And behold, I am sending what was promised by my Father upon you, but you stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up his hands, he blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it happened that while he was blessing them, he parted from them and was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And they were ˻continually˼ in the temple courts praising God.</verse>
