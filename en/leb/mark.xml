  <div type='book' osisID='Mark'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>Just as it is written in the prophet Isaiah,“Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face,who will prepare your way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>the voice of one shouting in the wilderness,‘Prepare the way of the Lord,make straight his paths!’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John was there baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the Judean region and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>And John was dressed in camel’s hair and a belt made of leather around his waist, and he ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he was preaching, saying, “One who is more powerful than I is coming after me, of whom I am not worthy to bend down and untie the strap of his sandals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it happened that in those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized in the Jordan by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens being split apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And a voice came from heaven, “You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the wilderness forty days being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John ˻had been taken into custody˼, Jesus went into Galilee proclaiming the gospel of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, “The time is fulfilled and the kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe in the gospel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And as he was passing by along the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, Simon’s brother, casting a net into the sea (for they were fishermen).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jesus said to them, “˻Follow˼ me and I will make you become fishers of people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and his brother John, and they were in the boat mending the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went away after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Capernaum and immediately on the Sabbath he went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one who had authority, and not like the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And so then there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, “˻Leave us alone˼, Jesus the Nazarene! Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are—the Holy One of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jesus rebuked him, saying, “Be silent, and come out of him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And after convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, the unclean spirit came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were all amazed, so that they began to discuss with one another, saying, “What is this? A new teaching with authority! He even commands the unclean spirits and they obey him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And the report about him then went out everywhere in the whole surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And so then he departed from the synagogue and came into the house of Simon and Andrew with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon’s mother-in-law was lying down, suffering with a fever, and at once they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he came and raised her up by taking hold of her hand, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Now when it was evening, when the sun had set, they began bringing to him all those ˻who were sick˼ and those who were demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole town was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many ˻who were sick˼ with various diseases and expelled many demons. And he did not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And getting up early in the morning while it was very dark, he departed and went to a deserted place, and there he was praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those who were with him searched diligently for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And they found him and said to him, “Everyone is looking for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he said to them, “Let us go elsewhere, into the neighboring rural towns, so that I can preach there also, because I have come out for this very reason.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he went into all Galilee preaching in their synagogues and expelling demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper came to him, entreating him and kneeling down and saying to him, “If you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And having compassion, he stretched out his hand and touched him, and said to him, “I am willing; be made clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And immediately the leprosy went away from him and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And warning him sternly, he sent him away at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>And he said to him, “See to it that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and bring for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out and began to proclaim it freely and to spread abroad the account, so that he was no longer able to enter publicly into a town. But he was staying outside in deserted places, and they were coming to him from all directions.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And when he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it became known that he was at home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And many had gathered, so that there was no longer room, not even at the door, and he was speaking the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came bringing to him a paralytic, carried by four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they were not able to bring him to him because of the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. And after digging through, they lowered the stretcher on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, “Child, your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Now some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>“Why does this man speak like this? He is blaspheming! Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they were reasoning like this within themselves, said to them, “Why are you considering these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say ‘Get up and pick up your stretcher and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins,”—he said to the paralytic—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>“I say to you, get up, pick up your stretcher, and go to your home.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he got up and immediately picked up his stretcher and went out in front of them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, “We have never seen anything like this!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he began to teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And as he was passing by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, “Follow me!” And he stood up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it happened that he ˻was dining˼ in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners ˻were dining with˼ Jesus and his disciples, for there were many and they were following him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, began to say to his disciples, “Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, “Those who are healthy do not have need of a physician, but those ˻who are sick˼. I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And John’s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and said to him, “˻Why˼ do the disciples of John and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, “The ˻bridegroom’s attendants˼ are not able to fast while the bridegroom is with them, are they? As long a time as they have the bridegroom with them, they are not able to fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one sews a patch of unshrunken cloth on an old garment. ˻Otherwise˼ the patch pulls away from it—the new from the old—and the tear becomes worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. ˻Otherwise˼ the wine will burst the wineskins and the wine is destroyed and the wineskins too. But new wine is put into new wineskins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it happened that he was going through the grain fields on the Sabbath, and his disciples began to make their way while plucking off the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees began to say to him, “Behold, why are they doing what is not permitted on the Sabbath?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them, “Have you never read what David did when he had need and he and those who were with him were hungry—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered into the house of God in the time of Abiathar the high priest and ate the bread of the presentation, which it is not permitted to eat (except the priests) and also gave it to those who were with him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, “The Sabbath was established for people, and not people for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So then, the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered into the synagogue again, and a man who had a withered hand was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they were watching him closely to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath, in order that they could accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he said to the man who had the withered hand, “Come into the middle.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he said to them, “Is it permitted on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their hearts, he said to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharisees went out immediately with the Herodians ˻and began to conspire˼ against him with regard to how they could destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jesus went away with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd from Galilee followed him. And from Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem and from Idumea and the other side of the Jordan and around Tyre and Sidon a great crowd came to him because they heard all that he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he told his disciples that a small boat should stand ready for him because of the crowd, so that they would not press upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed many, so that all those who ˻were suffering from diseases˼ pressed about him in order that they could touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, were falling down before him and crying out, saying, “You are the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he warned them strictly that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he went up on the mountain and summoned those whom he wanted, and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve, whom he also named apostles, so that they would be with him and so that he could send them out to preach</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to expel demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he appointed the twelve. And to Simon he gave the name Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (and he gave to them the name Boanerges, that is, “Sons of Thunder”),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Zealot,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they were not even able to eat a meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And when˻his family˼ heard this, they went out to restrain him, for they were saying, “He has lost his mind!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who had come down from Jerusalem were saying, “He is possessed by Beelzebul!” and “By the ruler of the demons he expels the demons!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And he called them to himself and was speaking to them in parables, “How can Satan expel Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he is not able to stand, but is at an end!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>But no one is able to enter into the house of a strong manand plunder his property unless he first ties up the strong man, and then he can thoroughly plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>“Truly I say to you that all the sins and the blasphemies will be forgiven the sons of men, however much they blaspheme.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit does not have forgiveness ˻forever˼, but is guilty of an eternal sin”—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they were saying, “He has an unclean spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>And his mother and his brothers arrived, and standing outside, they sent word to him to summon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a crowd was sitting around him, and they told him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered them and said, “Who are my mother and my brothers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking around at those who were sitting around him in a circle, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever does the will of God, this person is my brother and sister and mother.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach beside the sea, and a very large crowd was gathered to him, so that he got into a boat and sat on the sea, and the whole crowd was at the sea on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he began to teach them many things in parables, and was saying to them in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>“Listen! Behold, the sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it happened that while he was sowing, ˻some seed˼ fell on the side of the path, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And other seed fell on the rocky ground where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up at once, because it did not have any depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>And when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it did not have enough root, it withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And other seed fell among the thorn plants, and the thorn plants came up and choked it, and it did not produce grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And other seed fell on the good soil, and produced grain, coming up and increasing, and it bore a crop—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, “Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, those around him together with the twelve began asking him about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them, “To you has been granted the secret of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside everything is in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that‘˻they may look closely˼ and not perceive,and ˻they may listen carefully˼ and not understand,lest they turn and it be forgiven them.’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said to them, “Do you not understand this parable? And how will you understand all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are the ones beside the path where the word is sown, and whenever they hear it, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are the ones sown on the rocky ground, who whenever they hear the word immediately receive it with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>And they have no root in themselves, but are temporary. Then when affliction or persecution comes because of the word, immediately they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others are the ones sown among the thorn plants—these are the ones who hear the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of wealth and the desires for other things come in and choke the word and it becomes unproductive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And those are the ones sown on the good soil, who hear the word and receive it and bear fruit—one thirty and one sixty and one a hundred times as much.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, “Surely a lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a bushel basket or under a bed, is it? Is it not so that it may be put on a lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For nothing is secret except so that it may be revealed, nor has become hidden except so that it will come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them, “Take care what you hear! With the measure by which you measure out, it will be measured out to you, and will be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whoever has, more will be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, “The kingdom of God is like this: like a man scatters seed on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>And he sleeps and gets up, night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows—˻he does not know how˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>By itself the soil produces a crop: first the grass, then the head of grain, then the full grain in the head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the crop permits, he sends in the sickle right away, because the harvest has come.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, “With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or by what parable can we present it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard seed that when sown on the ground, although it is the smallest of all the seeds that are on the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>but when it is sown it grows up and becomes the largest of all the garden herbs, and sends out large branches so that the birds of the sky are able to nest in its shade.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And with many parables such as these he was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>And he did not speak to them without a parable, but in private he explained everything to his own disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>And on that day, when it was evening, he said to them, “Let us cross over to the other side.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And leaving the crowd, they took him along, as he was, in the boat. And other boats were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And a great storm of wind developed, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already being filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>And he was in the stern sleeping on the cushion, and they woke him up and said to him, “Teacher, is it not a concern to you that we are perishing?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he woke up and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, “Be quiet! Be silent!” And the wind abated and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said to them, “Why are you fearful? Do you not yet have faith?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And ˻they were terribly frightened˼ and began to say to one another, “Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>And they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And as he was getting out of the boat, immediately from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit went to meet him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who ˻lived˼ among the tombs. And no one was able to bind him any longer, not even with a chain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he had often been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been shattered. And no one was strong enough to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And during every night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>And when he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and knelt down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>And crying out with a loud voice he said, “˻What have I to do with you˼, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, do not torment me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>(For he was saying to him, “Come out of the man, unclean spirit!”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he was asking him “˻What is your name˼?” And he said to him, “My name is Legion, because we are many.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he was imploring him many times that he would not send them out of the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now a large herd of pigs was there at the hill feeding,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>and they implored him, saying, “Send us to the pigs so that we may enter into them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And he permitted them. And the unclean spirits came out and entered into the pigs, and the herd—about two thousand—rushed headlong down the steep slope into the sea and were drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And their herdsmen fled and reported it in the town and in the countryside, and they came to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man sitting there clothed and in his right mind—the one who had had the legion—and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man, and about the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to urge him to depart from their region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And as he was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed began to implore him that he could go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>And he did not permit him, but said to him, “Go to your home to your people and tell them all that the Lord has done for you, and that he has had mercy on you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis all that Jesus had done for him, and they were all astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>And after Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered to him, and he was beside the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And one of the rulers of the synagogue came—Jairus by name—and when he saw him, he fell down at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>And he was imploring him many times, saying, “My little daughter ˻is at the point of death˼! Come, lay your hands on her, so that she will get well and will live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And he went with him, and a large crowd was following him and pressing around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>And there was a woman who was ˻suffering from hemorrhages˼ twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>And she had endured many things under many physicians, and had spent ˻all that she had˼ and had received no help at all, but instead ˻became worse˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>When she heard about Jesus, she came up in the crowd behind himand touched his cloak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>for she was saying, “If I touch just his clothing, I will be healed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately her ˻hemorrhage stopped˼ and she realized in her body that she was healed of her suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from himself, turned around in the crowd and said, “Who touched my clothing?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>And his disciples said to him, “You see the crowd pressing upon you, and you say ‘Who touched me?’ ”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he was looking around to see the one who had done this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>So the woman, frightened and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before him and told him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>But he said to her, “Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace and be well from your suffering.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler’s house saying, “Your daughter has died. Why trouble the Teacher further?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, ignoring ˻what was said˼, told the ruler of the synagogue, “Do not be afraid—only believe!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he did not allow anyone to follow along with him except Peter and James and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And they came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue and saw a commotion, and people weeping and wailing loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when he entered, he said to them, “Why are you agitated and weeping? The child is not dead, but is sleeping.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they began laughing at him. But he sent them all out and took along the father and mother of the child, and those who were with him, and went in to where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And taking hold of the child’s hand, he said to her, “Talitha koum!” (which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>and immediately the girl stood up and began walking around (for she was twelve years old). And ˻immediately they were utterly and completely astonished˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he commanded them strictly that no one should learn of this, and said to give her something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>And he went out from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed, saying, “Where did this man get these things? And what is this wisdom that has been granted to this man, and the miracles such as these performed through his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us?” And they were offended by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>And Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own household.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he was not able to do any miracle in that place except to lay his hands on a few sick peopleand heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he was astonished because of their unbelief.And he was going around among the villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he summoned the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>And he commanded them that they take along nothing for the journey except only a staff—no bread, no traveler’s bag, no money in their belts—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but to put on sandals and not to wear two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, “Whenever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And whatever place does not welcome you or listen to you, as you go out from there, shake off the dust that is on your feet for a testimony against them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And they went out and proclaimed that people should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they were expelling many demons and anointing many sick people with olive oil and healing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And King Herod heard it, because his name had become known. And they were saying, “John, the one who baptizes, has been raised from the dead, and because of this these miraculous powers are at work in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>But others were saying, “He is Elijah,” and others were saying, “He is a prophet like one of the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herod heard it, he said, “John whom I beheaded—this one has been raised!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent and arrested John and bound him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of Philip his brother, because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John had been saying to Herod, “It is not permitted for you to have your brother’s wife.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>So Herodias held a grudge against him and was wanting to kill him, and was not able to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>For Herod was afraid of John, because he knew him to be a righteous and holy man and protected him. And when he listened to him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he listened to him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And a suitable day came when Herod, on his birthday, gave a banquet for his courtiers and military tribunes and the most prominent men of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>And when his daughter Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and ˻his dinner guests˼. The king said to the girl, “Ask me for whatever you want, and I will give it to you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he swore to her at length, “Anything whatever you ask me for I will give you, up to half my kingdom!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>And she went out and said to her mother, “What should I ask for?” And she said, “The head of John the baptizer.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, “I want you to give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter immediately.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And although he was deeply grieved, the king, because of his oaths and ˻dinner guests˼, did not want to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>And immediately the king sent an executioner and ordered him to bring his head. And he went and beheaded him in the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>And he brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>And when his disciples heard this, they came and took away his corpse and placed it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>And the apostles regathered to Jesus and reported to him everything that they had done and that they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And he said to them, “You yourselves come privately to an isolated place and rest for a short time.” For those who were coming and going were many, and they did not even have time to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>And they went away in the boat to an isolated place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>And many people saw them leaving and recognized them, and ran there together by land from all the towns, and arrived ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>And getting out of the boat he saw the large crowd and had compassion on them, because they were like sheep ˻without˼ a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And the hour had already become late when his disciples came up to him, saying, “The place is desolate and the hour is already late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send them away so that they can go into the surrounding farms and villages and purchase something to eat for themselves.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But he answered and said to them, “You give them something to eat.” And they said to him, “Should we go and purchase bread for two hundred denarii and give it to them to eat?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>And he said to them, “How many loaves do you have? Go look!” And when they found out, they said, “Five, and two fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>And he ordered them all to recline in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they reclined in groups, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks and broke the loaves and gave them to his disciples so that they could set them before them. And he distributed the two fish to them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>And they all ate and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they picked up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself dismissed the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And after he had said farewell to them, he went away to the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>And when evening came, the boat was in the middle of the sea and he was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And he saw them being beaten in their rowing because the wind was against them. Around the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he was wanting to pass by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>But when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought that it was a ghost, and they cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>For they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke with them and said to them, “Have courage, I am he! Do not be afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he went up with them into the boat, and the wind abated. And ˻they were extraordinarily˼ astounded within themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>because they did not understand concerning the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And after they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And as they were getting out of the boat, people recognized him immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>They ran about through that whole region and began to carry around those ˻who were sick˼ on stretchers, wherever they heard that he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever he would go, into villages or into towns or to farms, they would put those who were sick in the marketplaces and would implore him that if they could touch even the edge of his cloak. And all those who touched it were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>And the Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>And they saw that some of his disciples were eating their bread with unclean—that is, unwashed—hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands ˻ritually˼, thus holding fast to the traditions of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>And when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions which they have received and hold fast to—for example, the washing of cups and pitchers and bronze kettles and dining couches.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, “Why do your disciples not live according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unclean hands?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>So he said to them, “Isaiah prophesied correctly about you hypocrites, as it is written,‘This people honors me with their lips,but their heart is far, far away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>And they worship me in vain,teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>Abandoning the commandment of God, you hold fast to the tradition of men.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And he said to them, “You splendidly ignore the commandment of God so that you can maintain your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and, ‘The one who speaks evil of father or mother ˻must certainly die˼.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, ‘If a man says to his father or to his mother, “Whatever ˻benefit you would have received˼ from me iscorban” (that is, a gift to God),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down, and you do many similar things such as this.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And summoning the crowd again, he said to them, “Listen to me, all of you, and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing outside of a person that is able to defile him by going into him. But the things that go out of a person are the things that defile a person.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>And when he entered into the house away from the crowd, his disciples asked him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>And he said to them, “So are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything that is outside that goes into a person is not able to defile him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>For it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach, and goes out into the latrine”—thus declaring all foods clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>And he said, “What comes out of a person, that defiles a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, from the heart of people, come evil plans, sexual immoralities, thefts, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>adulteries, acts of greed, malicious deeds, deceit, licentiousness, ˻envy˼, abusive speech, pride, foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evil things come from within and defile a person.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>And from there he set out and went to the region of Tyre. And when he entered into a house, he wanted no one to know, and yet he was not able to escape notice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>But immediately a woman whose young daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit, when she heard about him, came and fell down at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>Now the woman was a Greek—a Syrophoenician by nationality—and she was asking him that he would expel the demon from her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>And he said to her, “Let the children be satisfied first, for it is not right to take the children’s bread and throw it to the dogs!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>But she answered and said to him, “Lord, even the dogs under the table eat the children’s crumbs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>And he said to her, “Because of this statement, go! The demon has gone out of your daughter.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>And when she went to her home, she found the child lying on the bed and the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>And again he went away from the region of Tyre and came through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, within the region of the Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had difficulty speaking, and they were imploring him that he would place his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And he took him away from the crowd by himself and put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting, he touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, “Ephphatha!” (that is, “Be opened!”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>And immediately his ears were opened and ˻his difficulty in speaking was removed˼ and he began to speak normally.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And he ordered them that they should say nothing, but as much as he ordered them not to, they proclaimed it even more instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>And they were amazed beyond all measure, saying, “He has done all things well! He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days there was again a large crowd, and they did not have anything they could eat. Summoning the disciples, he said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>“I have compassion on the crowd, because they have remained with me three days already and do not have anything to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if I send them away hungry to their homes they will give out on the way, and some of them have come from far away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>And his disciples answered him, “Where is anyone able to feed these people with bread here in the desert?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he asked them, “How many loaves do you have?” So they said, “Seven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>And he commanded the crowd to recline for a meal on the ground, and taking the seven loaves, after he had given thanks he broke them and began giving them to his disciples so that they could set them before them. And they set them before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few small fish, and after giving thanks for them, he said to set these before them also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>And they ate and were satisfied, and they picked up the broken pieces that were left, seven baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Now there were about four thousand. And he sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>And the Pharisees came and began to argue with him, demanding from him a sign from heaven in order to test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And sighing deeply in his spirit, he said, “Why does this generation demand a sign? Truly I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>And they had forgotten to take bread, and except for one loaf, they did not have any with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And he ordered them, saying, “Watch out! Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they began to discuss with one another that they had no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>And knowing this, he said to them, “Why are you discussing that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Have your hearts been hardened?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>And they came to Bethsaida. And they brought to him a blind man and implored him that he would touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>And he took hold of the blind man’s hand and led him outside the village, and after spitting in his eyes, he placed his hands on him and asked him, “Do you see anything?”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Then he placed his hands on his eyes again, and he opened his eyes and was cured, and could see everything clearly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jesus and his disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi, and on the way he asked his disciples, saying to them, “Who do people say that I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>And they told him, saying, “John the Baptist, and others Elijah, and others that you are one of the prophets.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>And he asked them, “But who do you say that I am?” Peter answered and said to him, “You are the Christ!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>And he warned them that they should tell no one about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And he began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>And he said to them, “Truly I say to you, that there are some of those standing here who will never experience death until they see the kingdom of God having come with power.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>And after six days, Jesus took along Peter and James and John, and led them to a high mountain by themselves alone. And he was transfigured before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>and his clothing became radiant—extremely white, like no cloth refiner on earth can ˻make so white˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>And Peter answered and said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good that we are here! And let us make three shelters, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>(For he did not know what he should answer, because they were terrified.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And a cloud came, overshadowing them, and a voice came from the cloud, “This is my beloved Son. Listen to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And as they were coming down from the mountain, he ordered them that they should tell no one the things that they had seen, except when the Son of Man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And they kept the matter to themselves, discussing what this rising from the dead ˻meant˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they asked him, saying, “˻Why do˼ the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>And he said to them, “Elijah indeed does come first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>But I tell you that indeed Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wanted, just as it is written about him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>And when they came to the disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and scribes arguing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>And immediately the whole crowd, when they saw him, were amazed, and ran up to himand greeted him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he asked them, “What are you arguing about with them?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>And one individual from the crowd answered him, “Teacher, I brought to you my son who has ˻a spirit that makes him mute˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down and he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes paralyzed. And I told your disciples that they should expel it, and they were not able to do so.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>And they brought him to him. And when he saw him, the spirit immediately convulsed him, and falling on the ground, he began to roll around, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>And he asked his father how long it was since this had been happening to him. And he said, “From childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And often it has thrown him both into fire and into water, in order that it could destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have compassion on us and help us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>But Jesus said to him, “If you are able! All thingsare possible for the one who believes!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, “I believe! Help my unbelief!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>Now when Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, “Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him, and enter into him no more!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>And it came out, screaming and convulsing him greatly, and he became as if he were dead, so that most of them said, “He has died!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus took hold of his hand and raised him up, and he stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>And after he had entered into the house, his disciples asked him privately, “Why were we not able to expel it?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>And he said to them, “This kind can come out by nothing except by prayer.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>And from there they went out and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>for he was teaching his disciples and was telling them, “The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand the statement, and they were afraid to ask him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>And they came to Capernaum. And after he was in the house, he asked them, “What were you discussing on the way?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they were silent, because they had argued with one another on the way about who was greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>And he sat down and called the twelve and said to them, “If anyone wants to be first, he will be last of all and servant of all.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And he took a young child and had him stand ˻among them˼. And taking him in his arms, he said to them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>For whoever is not against us is for us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life crippled than, having two hands, to go into hell—into the unquenchable fire!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off! It is better for you to enter into life lame than, having two feet, to be thrown into hell!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out! It is better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into hell,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>And from there he set out and came to the region of Judea and the other side of the Jordan, and again crowds came together to him. And again, as he was accustomed to do, he began to teach them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>And Pharisees came up and asked him if it was permitted for a man to divorce his wife, in order to test him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>And he answered and said to them, “What did Moses command you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>So they said, “Moses permitted a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>But Jesus said to them, “He wrote this commandment for you because of your hardness of heart.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>Jesus looked at them and said, “With human beings it is impossible, but not with God. For all thingsare possible with God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>Peter began to say to him, “Behold, we have left everything and followed you.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.35'>And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, “Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.36'>And he said to them, “What do you want me ˻to do˼ for you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>So they said to him, “Grant to us that we may sit one at your right hand and one at your left in your glory.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>But Jesus said to them, “You do not know what you are asking! Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>And they said to him, “We are able.” So Jesus said to them, “You will drink the cup that I drink, and you will be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but is for those for whom it has been prepared.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.41'>And when they heard this, the ten began to be indignant about James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>And Jesus called them to himself and said to them, “You know that those who are considered to rule over the Gentiles lord it over them, and their people in high positions exercise authority over them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.44'>and whoever wants to be most prominent among you must be the slave of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>And they came to Jericho. And as he was setting out from Jericho along with his disciples and a large crowd, a blind beggar, Bartimaeus the son of Timaeus, was sitting beside the road.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.51'>And Jesus answered him and said, “What do you want ˻me to do˼ for you?” And the blind man said to him, “Rabboni, that I may regain my sight.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.31'>And they began to discuss this with one another, saying, “If we say ‘From heaven,’ he will say, ‘Why then did you not believe him?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.32'>But if we say, ‘From men’ ”—they were afraid of the crowd, because they all looked upon John ˻as truly a prophet˼.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>And he began to speak to them in parables: “A man planted a vineyard, and put a fence around it, and dug a trough for the winepress, and built a watchtower, and leased it to tenant farmers, and went on a journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And he sent a slave to the tenant farmers at the proper time, so that he could collect some of the fruit of the vineyard from the tenant farmers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>And they seized him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>And again he sent to them another slave, and that one they struck on the head and dishonored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And he sent another, and that one they killed. And he sent many others, some of whom they beat and some of whom they killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>He had one more, a beloved son. Last of all he sent him to them, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But those tenant farmers said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and the inheritance will be ours!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>And they seized and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What then will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenant farmers and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>Have you not read this scripture:‘The stone which the builders rejected,this has become ˻the cornerstone˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>This came about from the Lord,and it is marvelous in our eyes’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they were seeking to arrest him, and they were afraid of the crowd, because they knew that he had told the parable with reference to them. And they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>And they sent some of the Pharisees and the Herodians to him so that they could catch him unawares in a statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And when they came, they said to him, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful and ˻you do not care what anyone thinks˼, ˻because you do not regard the opinion of people˼ but teach the way of God in truth. Is it permitted to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay or should we not pay?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>But because he knew their hypocrisy, he said to them, “Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius so that I can look at it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>So they brought one. And he said to them, “Whose image and inscription is this?” And they said to him, “Caesar’s.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>And Jesus said to them, “Give to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God!” And they were utterly amazed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>And Sadducees—who say there is no resurrection—came up to him and began to ask him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>“Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if someone’s brother dies and he leaves behind a wife and does not leave a child, that his brother should take the wife and ˻father˼ descendants for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>There were seven brothers, and the first took a wife. And when he died, he did not leave descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and he died without leaving descendants. And the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>And the seven did not leave descendants. Last of all the woman also died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection, when they rise, ˻whose˼ wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus said to them, “Are you not deceived because of this, because you do not know the scriptures or the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>Now concerning the dead, that they are raised, have you not read in the book of Moses ˻in the passage about the bush˼ how God spoke to him, saying, ‘I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob’?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>And one of the scribes came up and heard them debating. When he saw that he answered them well, he asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Listen, Israel! The Lord our God, the Lord is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>And you shall love the Lord your God from your whole heart and from your whole soul and from your whole mind and from your whole strength.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>And the scribe said to him, “That is true, Teacher. You have said ˻correctly˼ that he is one and there is no other except him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>And to love him from your whole heart and from your whole understanding and from your whole strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>And Jesus, when he saw that he had answered thoughtfully, said to him, “You are not far from the kingdom of God.” And no one dared to put a question to him any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And continuing, Jesus said while teaching in the temple courts, “How can the scribes say that the Christ is David’s son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>David himself said by the Holy Spirit,‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,until I put your enemiesunder your feet.” ’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>David himself calls him ‘Lord,’ and how is he his son?” And the large crowd was listening to him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And in his teaching he said, “Beware of the scribes, who like walking around in long robes and greetings in the marketplaces</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>who devour the houses of widows and pray lengthy prayers for the sake of appearance. These will receive more severe condemnation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And he sat down opposite the contribution box and was observing how the crowd was putting coins into the contribution box. And many rich people were putting in many coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And one poor widow came and put in two small copper coins (that is, a penny).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And summoning his disciples, he said to them, “Truly I say to you that this poor widow put in more than all those who put offerings into the contribution box.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For they all ˻contributed˼ out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty put in everything she had, her whole means of subsistence.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>And as he was going out of the temple courts, one of his disciples said to him, “Teacher, look! What great stones and what wonderful buildings!”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked intently at him and said, “You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, saying, “I neither know nor understand what you mean!” And he went out into the gateway, and a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the female slave, when she saw him, began to say again to the bystanders, “This man is one of them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But he denied it again. And after a little while, again the bystanders began to say to Peter, “You really are one of them, because you also are a Galilean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>And he began to curse and to swear with an oath, “I do not know this man whom you are talking about!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And immediately a rooster crowed for the second time. And Peter remembered the statement, how Jesus had said to him, “Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times,” and throwing himself down, he began to weep.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>And as soon as morning came, after formulating a plan, the chief priests, with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin, tied up Jesus, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilate asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?” And he answered him and said, “You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests began to accuse him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>So Pilate asked him again, saying, “Do you not answer anything? See how many charges they are bringing against you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus did not answer anything further, so that Pilate was astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at each feast he customarily released for them one prisoner whom they requested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And the one named Barabbas was imprisoned with the rebels who had committed murder in the rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the crowd came up and began to ask him to do as he customarily did for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>So Pilate answered them, saying, “Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>(For he realized that the chief priests had handed him over because of envy.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests incited the crowd so that he would release for them Barabbas instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>So Pilate answered and said to them again, “Then what do you want me to do with the one whom you call the king of the Jews?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they shouted again, “Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>And Pilate said to them, “Why? What evil has he done?” But they shouted even louder, “Crucify him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, because he wanted ˻to satisfy˼ the crowd, released for them Barabbas. And after he had Jesus flogged, he handed him over so that he could be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>So the soldiers led him away into the palace (that is, the governor’s residence) and called together the whole cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they put a purple cloak on him, and after weaving a crown of thorns they placed it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>And they began to greet him, “Hail, king of the Jews!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they repeatedly struck him on the head with a reed, and were spitting on him, and ˻they knelt down˼and did obeisance to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him, and they led him out so that they could crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they forced a certain man who was passing by, Simon of Cyrene (the father of Alexander and Rufus), who was coming from the country, to carry his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought him to the place Golgotha (which is translated “Place of a Skull”).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they attempted to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And they crucified him and divided his clothes among themselves by casting lots for them to see who should take what.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>Now it was the third hour when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And the inscription of the charge against him was written, “The king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those who passed by reviled him, shaking their heads and saying, “Aha! The one who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself by coming down from the cross!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>In the same way also the chief priests, along with the scribes, were mocking him to one another, saying, “He saved others; he is not able to save himself!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the king of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe! Even those who were crucified with him were reviling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>And when the sixth hour came, darkness came over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, “Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?” (which is translated, “My God, my God, ˻why˼ have you forsaken me?”)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And some of the bystanders, when they heard it, said, “Behold, he is summoning Elijah!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, “Leave him alone! Let us see if Elijah is coming to take him down.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>But Jesus uttered a loud cry and expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>And the curtain of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>And when the centurion who was standing opposite him saw that he expired like this, he said, “Truly this man was God’s Son!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And there were also women observing from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who used to follow him and serve him when he was in Galilee, and many other women who went up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And when it was already evening, since it was the day of preparation (that is, the day before the Sabbath),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent member of the council who was also himself looking forward to the kingdom of God, came acting courageously and went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate was surprised that he was already dead, and summoning the centurion, asked him whether he had died already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he learned of it from the centurion, he granted the corpse to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And after purchasing a linen cloth and taking him down, he wrapped him in the linen cloth and placed him in a tomb that had been cut from the rock. And he rolled a stone over the entrance of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was placed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome purchased fragrant spices so that they could go and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early in the morning on the first day of the week they came to the tomb after the sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they were saying to one another, “Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away (for it was very large).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And as they were going into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, “Do not be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene who was crucified. He has been raised, he is not here! See the place where they laid him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And they went out and fled from the tomb, because trembling and amazement had seized them. And they said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.〚So they promptly reported all the things they had been commanded to those around Peter. And after these things, Jesus himself also sent out through them from the east even as far as the west the holy and imperishable proclamation of eternal salvation. Amen.〛〚</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now early on the first day of the week, after he rose, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had expelled seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went out and announced it to those who were with him while they were mourning and weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And those, when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, refused to believe it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>And after these things, he appeared in a different form to two of them as they were walking, while they were going out into the countryside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And these went and reported it to the others, and they did not believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>And later, while they were reclining at table, he appeared to the eleven. And he reprimanded their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who had seen him after he had been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, “Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>The one who believes and is baptized will be saved, but the one who refuses to believe will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will expel demons, they will speak in new tongues,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>and they will pick up snakes with their hands. And if they drink any deadly poison it will never hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick and ˻they will get˼ well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>Then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went out and proclaimed everywhere, while the Lord was working together with them and confirming the message through the accompanying signs.〛</verse>
