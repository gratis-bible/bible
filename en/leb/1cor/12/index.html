If the whole were hearing, where would the sense of smell be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body just as he wanted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And if they all were one member, where would the body be?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>But now there are many members, but one body.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Now the eye is not able to say to the hand, “I do not have need of you,” or again, the head to the feet, “I do not have need of you.”</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>But by much more the members of the body which are thought to be weaker are necessary,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>and the parts of the body which we think to be less honorable, these we clothe with more abundant honor, and our unpresentable parts come to have more abundant presentability,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>but our presentable parts do not have need of this. Yet God composed the body by giving more abundant honor to the part which lacked it,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>in order that there not be a division in the body, but the members would have the same concern for one another.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And if one member suffers, all the members suffer together; if one member is honored, all the members rejoice with it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>Now you are the body of Christ, and members ˻of it individually˼,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and whom God has appointed in the church: first, apostles, second, prophets, third, teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all are workers of miracles, are they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Not all have gifts of healing, do they? Not all speak with tongues, do they? Not all interpret, do they?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>But strive for the greater gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
