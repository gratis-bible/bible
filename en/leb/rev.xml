      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his slaves the things which must take place in a short time, and communicated itby sending it through his angel to his slave John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified about the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, all that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is the one who reads aloud and blessed are those who hear the words of the prophecy and observe the things written in it, because the time is near!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John, to the seven churches in Asia: grace to you and peace from the one who is and the one who was and the one who is coming, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn from the dead and the ruler of the kings of the earth.To the one who loves us and released us from our sins by his blood</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father—to him be the glory and the power ˻forever and ever˼. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he is coming with the clouds,and every eye will see him,even every one who pierced him,and all the tribes of the earth will mourn over him.Yes, amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, says the Lord God, the one who is and the one who was and the one who is coming, the All-Powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, John, your brother and co-sharer in the affliction and kingdom and steadfastness in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a great sound like a trumpet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, “What you see, write in a book and send it to the seven churches: to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice which was speaking with me, and when I turned, I saw seven gold lampstands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, dressed in a robe reaching to the feet and girded around his chest with a golden belt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>and his head and hair were white like wool, white as snow, and his eyes were like a fiery flame,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet were like fine bronze when it has been fired in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of many waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>and he had in his right hand seven stars, and a sharp double-edged sword coming out of his mouth, and his face was like the sun shining in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead person, and he placed his right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid! I am the first and the last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and the one who lives, and I was dead, and behold, I am living ˻forever and ever˼, and I hold the keys of death and of Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Therefore, write the things which you saw, and the things which are, and the things which are about to take place after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>As for the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands—the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>“To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:“This is what the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand says, the one who walks in the midst of the seven gold lampstands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>‘I know your works, and your labor and patient endurance, and that you are not able to tolerate evil, and you put to the test those who call themselves apostles and are not, and you found them to be false.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And you have patient endurance, and have endured many things because of my name, and have not become weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have this against you: that you have left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do ˻the works you did at first˼. But if you do not, I am coming to you, and I will remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But you do have this: that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, things which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will grant to him to eat from the tree of life which is in the paradise of God.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>“And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write:“This is what the first and the last says, who was dead and came to life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>‘I know your affliction and poverty (but you are rich), and the slander of those ˻who call themselves Jews˼ and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Do not be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested, and you will experience affliction ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will never be harmed by the second death.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>“And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write:“This is what the one who has the sharp double-edged sword says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>‘I know where you live, where the throne of Satan is. And you hold fast to my name and did not deny your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you: that you have there those who hold fast to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat food sacrificed to idols and to commit sexual immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So likewise you also have those who hold fast to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Therefore repent! But if you do not, I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war with them with the sword from my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers, I will give to him some of the hidden manna, and I will give to him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, that no one knows except the one who receives it.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>“And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write:“This is what the Son of God says, the one who has his eyes like a fiery flame and his feet like fine bronze:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>‘I know your works, and your love, and faith, and service, and patient endurance—and your last works are greater than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have against you that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, the one who calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and deceives my slaves to commit sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I have given her time in order to repent, and she did not want to repent from her sexual immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I am throwing her into a sickbed and those who committed adultery with her into great affliction, unless they repent from her deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children with deadly disease, and all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts, and I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But I say to you, to the rest who are in Thyatira, all those who do not hold this teaching, who have not known the deep things of Satan, as they say, I do not put upon you any other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>Nevertheless, hold fast to what you have until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And the one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, I will give him authority over the nations,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>and “he will shepherd them with an iron rod; he will break them in pieces like jars made of clay,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>as I also have received from my Father, and I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>“And to the angel of the church in Sardis write:“This is what the one who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says: ‘I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, and you are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Be on the alert and strengthen the remaining things that are about to die, for I have not found your works completed before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Therefore remember how you have received and heard, and observe it, and repent. If therefore you are not on the alert, I will come like a thief, and you will never know at what hour I will come against you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But you have a few ˻people˼ in Sardis who have not defiled their clothing, and they will walk with me in white, because they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>The one who conquers in this way will be dressed in white clothing, and I will never erase his name from the book of life, and I will declare his name before my Father and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>“And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:“This is what the holy one, the true one, the one who has the key of David, the one who opens and no one can shut, and who shuts and no one can open, says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>‘I know your works (behold, I have put before you an opened door that no one is able to shut) that you have a little strength, and have kept my word, and did not deny my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I am causing those of the synagogue of Satan, the ones who call themselves Jews and are not, but are lying—behold, I will make them ˻come˼ and kneel down before your feet and acknowledge that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you have kept the word of my patient endurance, I also will keep you from the hour of testing that is about to come upon the whole inhabited world, to put to the test those who live on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I am coming quickly! Hold fast to what you have, so that no one may take away your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will never go outside again, and I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem that comes down from heaven from my God, and my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>“And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write:“This is what the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the originator of God’s creation, says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>‘I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were cold or hot!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>Thus, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to vomit you out of my mouth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you are saying, “I am rich, and have become rich, and I have need of nothing,” and you do not know that you are wretched and pitiable and poor and blind and naked,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire, in order that you may become rich, and white clothing, in order that you may be clothed and the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed, and eye salve to smear on your eyes, in order that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I reprove and discipline. Be zealous, therefore, and repent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and knock! If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, indeed I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>The one who conquers, I will grant to him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also have conquered and have sat down with my Father on his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>The one who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.’ ”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked, and behold, an open door in heaven, and the former voice that I had heard like a trumpet speaking with me was saying, “Come up here and I will show you the things which must take place after these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one was seated on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And the one seated was similar in appearance to jasper and carnelian stone, and a rainbow was around the throne similar in appearance to emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders dressed in white clothing, and on their heads were gold crowns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And from the throne came out lightnings and sounds and thunders, and seven torches of fire were burning before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like crystal, and in the midst of the throne and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first living creature was similar to a lion, and the second living creature was similar to an ox, and the third living creature had a face like a man’s, and the fourth living creature was similar to an eagle flying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four living creatures, ˻each one˼ of them, had six wings apiece, full of eyes around and inside, and they do not have rest day and night, saying,“Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God All-Powerful,the one who was and the one who is and the one who is coming!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to the one who is seated on the throne, the one who lives ˻forever and ever˼,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders fall down before the one who is seated on the throne and worship the one who lives ˻forever and ever˼, and put down their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>“You are worthy, our Lord and God,to receive glory and honor and power,because you have created all things,and because of your will they existed and were created.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right hand of the one who is seated on the throne a scroll, written inside and on the back, sealed up with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice, “Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep! Behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders a Lamb standing as though slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who was seated on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one of whom had a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they were singing a new song, saying,“You are worthy to take the scrolland to open its seals,because you were slaughtered,and bought people for God by your bloodfrom every tribe and language and people and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and made them a kingdom and priests to our God,and they will reign on the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I looked, and I heard the voice of many angels around the throne and of the living creatures and of the elders, and their number was ten thousand times ten thousand and thousands times thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a loud voice,“Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughteredto receive power and richesand wisdom and strengthand honor and glory and praise!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And I heard every creature that is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and in the sea and everything in them saying,“To the one who is seated on the throne and to the Lambbe praise and honor and glory and power˻forever and ever˼.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living creatures were saying, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying like the sound of thunder, “Come!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I looked, and behold, a white horse, and the one seated on it had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and in order that he might conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse came out, fiery red, and it was granted to the one seated on it to take peace from the earth, and that they would slaughter one another, and a large sword was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come!” And I looked, and behold, a black horse, and the one seated on it had a balance scale in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard something like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not damage the olive oil and the wine!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard a voice from the fourth living creature saying, “Come!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I looked, and behold, a pale green horse, and the one seated on it ˻was named˼ Death, and Hades followed after him. And authority was granted to them over a fourth of the earth, to kill by the sword and by famine and by pestilence and by the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and because of the testimony which they had,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>and they cried out with a loud voice, saying, “˻How long˼, holy and true Lord, will you not judge and avenge our blood from those who live on the earth?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And to each one of them a white robe was given, and it was said to them that they should rest yet a short time, until the number of their fellow slaves and their brothers who were about to be killed as they had been were completed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I watched when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake took place, and the sun became black like sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became like blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars of heaven fell to the earth like a fig tree throws down its unripe figs when shaken by a great wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the sky was split apart like a scroll that is rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved from their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the most important people, and the military leaders, and the rich, and the powerful, and every slave and free person hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And they said to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>because the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, so that no wind could blow on the earth or on the sea or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel ascending ˻from the east˼, holding the seal of the living God, and he cried out with a loud voice to the four angels ˻who were given permission˼ to damage the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, “Do not damage the earth or the sea or the trees until we have sealed the slaves of our God on their foreheads.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of the ones who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand sealed,from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand,from the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>from the tribe of Asher, twelve thousand,from the tribe of Naphtali, twelve thousand,from the tribe of Manasseh, twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.7'>from the tribe of Simeon, twelve thousand,from the tribe of Levi, twelve thousand,from the tribe of Issachar, twelve thousand,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, coming out from the throne of God and of the Lamb</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>in the middle of its street, and ˻on both sides of the river˼is the tree of life, producing twelve fruits—yielding its fruit according to every month—and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And there will not be any curse any longer, and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his slaves will serve him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>and they will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And night will not exist any longer, and they will not have need of the light of a lamp and of the light of the sun, because the Lord God will give light to them. And they will reign ˻forever and ever˼.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>And he said to me, “These words are faithful and true, and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his slaves the things which must take place in a short time.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>“And behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I, John, am the one who heard and who saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel who showed these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>And he said to me, “˻Do not do that!˼ I am your fellow slave, and of your brothers the prophets, and of those who keep the words of this book. Worship God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>And he said to me, “Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>The one who does evil, let him do evil still, and the defiled, let him be defiled still, and the righteous, let him practice righteousness still, and the holy, let him be holy still.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>“Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward is with me, to repay each one according to what his deeds are!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>Blessed are the ones who wash their robes, so that their authority will be over the tree of life and they may enter into the city through the gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>Outside are the dogs and the sorcerers and the sexually immoral people and the murderers and the idolaters and everyone who loves and who practices falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>“I, Jesus, sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>And the Spirit and the bride say, “Come!” And the one who hears, let him say, “Come!” And the one who is thirsty, let him come. The one who wants, let him take the water of life freely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>I testify to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>And if anyone takes away from the words of this book of prophecy, God will take away his share of the tree of life and from the holy city that are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>The one who testifies about these things says, “Yes, I am coming quickly!” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all.</verse>
