      <chapter osisID='Rev.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>This is the Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things which must happen soon, which he sent and made known by his angel to his servant, John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified to God`s word, and of the testimony of Jesus Christ, about everything that he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and keep the things that are written in it, for the time is at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John, to the seven assemblies that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace, from God, who is and who was and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us, and washed us from our sins by his blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and he made us to be a kingdom, priests to his God and Father; to him be the glory and the dominion forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, including those who pierced him. All the tribes of the earth will mourn over him. Even so, Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>"I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, your brother and partaker with you in oppression and kingdom and perseverance which are in Jesus, was on the isle that is called Patmos because of God`s Word and the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord`s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice, as of a trumpet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, "What you see, write in a book and send to the seven assemblies: to Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and to Laodicea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>I turned to see the voice that spoke with me. Having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>And in the midst of the lampstands was one like a son of man, clothed with a robe reaching down to his feet, and with a golden sash around his chest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>His head and his hair were white as white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>His feet were like burnished brass, as if it had been refined in a furnace. His voice was like the voice of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>He had seven stars in his right hand. Out of his mouth proceeded a sharp two-edged sword. His face was like the sun shining at its brightest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>When I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man. He laid his right hand on me, saying, "Don`t be afraid. I am the first and the last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and the Living one. I was dead, and behold, I am alive forevermore. I have the keys of Death and of Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write therefore the things which you have seen, and the things which are, and the things which will happen hereafter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>the mystery of the seven stars which you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the angels of the seven assemblies. The seven lampstands are seven assemblies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the assembly in Ephesus write:     "He who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>"I know your works, and your toil and perseverance, and that you can`t tolerate evil men, and have tested those who call themselves apostles, and they are not, and found them false.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>You have perseverance and have endured for my name`s sake, and have not grown weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have this against you, that you left your first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from where you have fallen, and repent and do the first works; or else I am coming to you, and will move your lampstand out of its place, unless you repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this you have, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>"To the angel of the assembly in Smyrna write:     "The first and the last, who was dead, and has come to life says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>"I know your oppression, and your poverty (but you are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Don`t be afraid of the things which you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested; and you will have oppression for ten days. Be faithful to death, and I will give you the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. He who overcomes won`t be hurt by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>"To the angel of the assembly in Pergamum write:     "He who has the sharp two-edged sword says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>"I know your works and where you dwell, where Satan`s throne is. You hold firmly to my name, and didn`t deny my faith, even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against you, because you have there some who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the children of Israel, to eat things sacrificed to idols, and to commit sexual immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So you also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent therefore, or else I am coming to you quickly, and I will make war against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies. To him who overcomes, to him will I give of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>"To the angel of the assembly in Thyatira write:     "The Son of God, who has his eyes like a flame of fire, and his feet are like burnished brass, says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know your works, your love, faith, service, patient endurance, and that your last works are more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have this against you, that you tolerate your woman, Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess. She teaches and seduces my servants to commit sexual immorality, and to eat things sacrificed to idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I will throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great oppression, unless they repent of her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>I will kill her children with Death, and all the assemblies will know that I am he who searches the minds and hearts. I will give to each one of you according to your deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you I say, to the rest who are in Thyatira, as many as don`t have this teaching, who don`t know what some call `the deep things of Satan,` to you I say, I don`t lay on you any other burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>Nevertheless that which you have, hold firmly until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>He who overcomes, and he who keeps my works to the end, to him will I give authority over the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>He will rule them with a rod of iron, shattering them like clay pots; as I also have received of my Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>and I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>"And to the angel of the assembly in Sardis write:     He who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars says these things:     "I know your works, that you have a reputation of being alive, but you are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Wake up, and establish the things that remain, which were ready to die, for I have found no works of yours perfected before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how you have received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If therefore you won`t watch, I will come as a thief, and you won`t know what hour I will come on you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>Nevertheless you have a few names in Sardis that did not defile their garments. They will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who overcomes will be arrayed like this in white garments, and I will in no way blot his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>"To the angel of the assembly in Philadelphia write:     "He who is holy, he who is true, he who has the key of David, he who opens and no one can shut, and that shuts and no one opens, says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>"I know your works (behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one can shut), that you have a little power, and kept my word, and didn`t deny my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, of those who say they are Jews, and they are not, but lie. Behold, I will make them to come and worship before your feet, and to know that I have loved you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because you kept the word of my patience, I also will keep you from the hour of testing, that which is to come on the whole world, to test those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I come quickly. Hold firmly that which you have, so that no one takes your crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will go out from there no more. I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down out of heaven from my God, and my own new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>"To the angel of the assembly in Laodicea write:     "The Amen, the Faithful and True Witness, the Head of God`s creation, says these things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>"I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit you out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because you say, `I am rich, and have gotten riches, and have need of nothing;` and don`t know that you are the wretched one, miserable, poor, blind, and naked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, that you may become rich; and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of your nakedness may not be revealed; and eye salve to anoint your eyes, that you may see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I reprove and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>He who overcomes, I will give to him to sit down with me on my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father on his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the assemblies."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked and saw a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard, like a trumpet speaking with me, was one saying, "Come up here, and I will show you the things which must happen after this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>Immediately I was in the Spirit. Behold, there was a throne set in heaven, and one sitting on the throne</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>that looked like a jasper stone and a sardius. There was a rainbow around the throne, like an emerald to look at.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Around the throne were twenty-four thrones. On the thrones were twenty-four elders sitting, dressed in white garments, with crowns of gold on their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>Out of the throne proceed lightnings, sounds, and thunders. There were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>Before the throne was something like a sea of glass, like a crystal. In the midst of the throne, and around the throne were four living creatures full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>The first creature was like a lion, and the second creature like a calf, and the third creature had a face like a man, and the fourth creature was like a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>and the four living creatures, having each one of them six wings, are full of eyes around about and within. They have no rest day and night, saying,     Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty, who was and who is and who is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>When the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to him who sits on the throne, to him who lives forever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders fall down before him who sits on the throne, and worship him who lives forever and ever, and will throw their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>"Worthy are you, our Lord and our God, to receive the glory, the honor, and the power, for you created all things, and because of your desire they existed, and were created."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>I saw, in the right hand of him who sat on the throne, a book written within and on the back, sealed shut with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>I saw a mighty angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the book, and to break its seals?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>No one in heaven, or on the earth, or under the earth, was able to open the book, or to look in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much, because no one was found worthy to open the book, or to look in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>One of the elders said to me, "Don`t weep. Behold, the Lion who is of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the book and its seven seals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, having seven horns, and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>Then he came, and he took it out of the right hand of him who sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>Now when he had taken the book, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each one having a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>They sang a new song, saying, "You are worthy to take the book, And to open its seals: For you were killed, And bought us for God with your blood, Out of every tribe, language, people, and nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And made them kings and priests to our God, And they reign on earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>I saw, and I heard a voice of many angels around the throne, the living creatures, and the elders; and the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a loud voice,     "Worthy is the Lamb who has been killed to receive the power, riches, wisdom, might, honor, glory, and blessing!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>I heard every created thing which is in heaven, on the earth, under the earth, on the sea, and everything in them, saying,     "To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb be the blessing, the honor, the glory, and the dominion, forever and ever. Amen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>The four living creatures said, "Amen!" The elders fell down and worshipped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, "Come and see!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>I saw, and behold, a white horse, and he who sat on it had a bow. A crown was given to him, and he came forth conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>Another came forth, a red horse. To him who sat on it was given to take peace from the earth, and that they should kill one another. There was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, "Come and see!" I saw, and behold, a black horse. He who sat on it had a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>I heard a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, "A choenix of wheat for a denarius, and three choenix of barley for a denarius! Don`t damage the oil and the wine!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, "Come and see!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>I saw, and behold, a pale horse. He who sat on him, his name was Death. Hades followed with him. Authority over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, with famine, with death, and by the wild animals of the earth was given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>When he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>They cried with a loud voice, saying, "How long, Master, the holy and true, do you not judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>There was given to each one of them a white robe. It was said to them that they should rest yet for a little time, until their fellow servants and their brothers, who would also be killed even as they were, had been fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became black as sackcloth made of hair, and the whole moon became as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>The stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its unripe figs when it is shaken by a great wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>The sky was removed as a scroll when it is rolled up. Every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>The kings of the earth, the princes, the commanding officers, the rich, the strong, and every slave and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>They told the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>for the great day of his wrath has come; and who is able to stand?"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that no wind would blow on the earth, or on the sea, or on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>I saw another angel ascend from the sunrise, having the seal of the living God. He cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to harm the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, "Don`t harm the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the bondservants of our God on their foreheads!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>I heard the number of those who were sealed, one hundred forty-four thousand, sealed out of every tribe of the children of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Of the tribe of Judah were sealed twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Reuben twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Gad twelve thousand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.6'>Of the tribe of Asher twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Naphtali twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Manasseh twelve thousand,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>Of the tribe of Zebulun twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Joseph twelve thousand, Of the tribe of Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After these things I saw, and behold, a great multitude, which no man could number, out of every nation and of all tribes, peoples, and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, dressed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>They cried with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation be to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>All the angels were standing around the throne, the elders, and the four living creatures; and they fell before the throne on their faces, and worshipped God,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>When he opened the seventh seal, there followed a silence in heaven for about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Another angel came and stood over the altar, having a golden censer. Much incense was given to him, that he should add it to the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar which was before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>The smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, went up before God out of the angel`s hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>The angel took the censer, and he filled it with the fire of the altar, and threw it on the earth. There followed thunders, sounds, lightnings, and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>The seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>The first sounded, and there followed hail and fire, mingled with blood, and they were thrown on the earth. One third of the earth was burnt up, and one third of the trees were burnt up, and all green grass was burnt up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>The second angel sounded, and something like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One third of the sea became blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>and one third of the creatures which were in the sea died, those who had life. One third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>The third angel sounded, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on one third of the rivers, and on the springs of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>The name of the star is called "Wormwood." One third of the waters became wormwood. Many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>The fourth angel sounded, and one third of the sun was struck, and one third of the moon, and one third of the stars; so that one third of them would be darkened, and the day wouldn`t shine for one third of it, and the night in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>I saw, and I heard an eagle, flying in mid heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe! Woe! Woe for those who dwell on the earth, because of the other voices of the trumpets of the three angels, who are yet to sound.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>The fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star from the sky fallen to the earth. The key to the pit of the abyss was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>He opened the pit of the abyss, and smoke went up out of the pit, like the smoke from a great furnace. The sun and the air were darkened because of the smoke from the pit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Then out of the smoke came forth locusts on the earth, and power was given to them, as the scorpions of the earth have power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>They were told that they should not hurt the grass of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree, but only those men who don`t have God`s seal on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>They were given power not to kill them, but to torment them for five months. Their torment was like the torment of a scorpion, when it strikes a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>In those days men will seek death, and will in no way find it. They will desire to die, and death will flee from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>The shapes of the locusts were like horses prepared for war. On their heads were something like gold crowns, and their faces were like men`s faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>They had hair like women`s hair, and their teeth were like those of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>They had breastplates, like breastplates of iron. The sound of their wings was like the sound of chariots, or of many horses rushing to war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>They have tails like those of scorpions, and stings. In their tails is their power to harm men for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>They have over them as king the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew is "Abaddon," but in Greek, he has the name "Apollyon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>The first woe is past. Behold, there are still two woes coming after this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>The sixth angel sounded. I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar which is before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>saying to the sixth angel who had one trumpet, "Free the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>The four angels were freed who had been prepared for that hour and day and month and year, so that they would kill one third of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>The number of the armies of the horsemen was two hundred million. I heard the number of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>Thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who sat on them, having breastplates of fiery red, hyacinth blue, and sulfur yellow; and the heads of lions. Out of their mouths proceed fire, smoke, and sulfur.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three plagues were one third of mankind killed: by the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur, which proceeded out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For the power of the horses is in their mouths, and in their tails. For their tails are like serpents, and have heads, and with them they harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>The rest of mankind, who were not killed with these plagues, didn`t repent of the works of their hands, that they wouldn`t worship demons, and the idols of gold, and of silver, and of brass, and of stone, and of wood; which can neither see, nor hear, nor walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>They didn`t repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>I saw another mighty angel coming down out of the sky, clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was on his head. His face was like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.2'>He had in his hand a little book open. He set his right foot on the sea, and his left on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>He cried with a loud voice, as a lion roars. When he cried, the seven thunders uttered their voices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>When the seven thunders sounded, I was about to write; but I heard a voice from the sky saying, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and don`t write them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>The angel who I saw standing on the sea and on the land lifted up his right hand to the sky,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and the things that are in it, the earth and the things that are in it, and the sea and the things that are in it, that there will no longer be delay,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he is about to sound, then the mystery of God is finished, as he declared to his servants, the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>The voice which I heard from heaven, again speaking with me, said, "Go, take the book which is open in the hand of the angel who stands on the sea and on the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>I went to the angel, saying, "Give me the little book."     He said to me, "Take it, and eat it up. It will make your belly bitter, but in your mouth it will be as sweet as honey."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>I took the little book out of the angel`s hand, and ate it up. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth. When I had eaten it, my belly was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>He told me, "You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.1'>A reed like a rod was given to me. One said, "Rise, and measure God`s temple, and the altar, and those who worship in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.2'>Leave out the court which is outside of the temple, and don`t measure it, for it has been given to the gentiles. They will tread the holy city under foot for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.3'>I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy one thousand two hundred sixty days, clothed in sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.4'>These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands, standing before the Lord of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.5'>If anyone desires to harm them, fire proceeds out of their mouth and devours their enemies. If anyone desires to harm them, he must be killed in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.6'>These have the power to shut up the sky, that it may not rain during the days of their prophecy. They have power over the waters, to turn them into blood, and to strike the earth with every plague, as often as they desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.7'>When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the abyss will make war with them, and overcome them, and kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.8'>Their dead bodies will be in the street of the great city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.9'>From among the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will people look at their dead bodies for three and a half days, and will not allow their dead bodies to be laid in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.10'>Those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them, and make merry. They will send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented those who dwell on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.11'>After the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered into them, and they stood on their feet. Great fear fell on those who saw them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.12'>I heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here!" They went up into heaven in the cloud, and their enemies saw them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.13'>In that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified, and gave glory to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.14'>The second woe is past. Behold, the third woe comes quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.15'>The seventh angel sounded, and there followed great voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Christ. He will reign forever and ever!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.16'>The twenty-four elders, who sit before God on their thrones, fell on their faces and worshipped God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.11.17'>saying:     "We give you thanks, Lord God, the Almighty, the one who is and who was; because you have taken your great power, and reigned.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.11.19'>God`s temple that is in heaven was opened, and the ark of the Lord`s covenant was seen in his temple. There followed lightnings, sounds, thunders, an earthquake, and great hail.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.12'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.1'>A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.2'>She was with child. She cried out, laboring and in pain, giving birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.3'>Another sign was seen in heaven. Behold, a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven crowns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.4'>His tail drew one third of the stars of the sky, and threw them to the earth. The dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.5'>She gave birth to a son, a male child, who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron. Her child was caught up to God, and to his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.6'>The woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, that there they may nourish her one thousand two hundred sixty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.7'>There was war in the sky. Michael and his angels made war on the dragon. The dragon and his angels made war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.8'>They didn`t prevail, neither was a place found for him any more in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.9'>The great dragon was thrown down, the old serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.10'>I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now is come the salvation, the power, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ; for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them before our God day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.11'>They overcame him because of the Lamb`s blood, and because of the word of their testimony. They didn`t love their life, even to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.12'>Therefore rejoice, heavens, and you who dwell in them. Woe for the earth and for the sea, because the devil has gone down to you, having great wrath, knowing that he has but a short time."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.13'>When the dragon saw that he was thrown down to the earth, he persecuted the woman who gave birth to the male child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.14'>Two wings of the great eagle were given to the woman, that she might fly into the wilderness to her place, where she was nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.15'>The serpent spewed water out of his mouth after the woman like a river, that he might cause her to be carried away by the stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.12.16'>The earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed up the river which the dragon spewed out of his mouth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.13.1'>Then I stood on the sand of the sea. I saw a beast coming up out of the sea, having ten horns and seven heads. On his horns were ten crowns, and on his heads, blasphemous names.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>The beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet were like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>One of his heads looked like it had been wounded fatally. His fatal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled at the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>They worshipped the dragon, because he gave his authority to the beast, and they worshipped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>A mouth speaking great things and blasphemy was given to him. Authority to continue for forty-two months was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.6'>He opened his mouth for blasphemy against God, to blaspheme his name, and his tent, those who dwell in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.7'>It was given to him to make war with the saints, and to overcome them. Authority over every tribe, people, language, and nation was given to him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.13.10'>If anyone gathers into captivity, into captivity he goes. If anyone will kill with the sword, with the sword he must be killed. Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.11'>I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. He had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.12'>He exercises all the authority of the first beast in his presence. He makes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.13'>He performs great signs, even making fire come down out of the sky on the earth in the sight of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.14'>He deceives my own people who dwell on the earth because of the signs which it was given him to do in front of the beast; saying to those who dwell on the earth, that they should make an image to the beast who had the sword wound and lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.15'>It was given to him to give breath to it, to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause as many as wouldn`t worship the image of the beast to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.16'>He causes all, the small and the great, the rich and the poor, and the free and the slave, to be given a mark on their right hand, or on their forehead;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.14.3'>They sing something like a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures and the elders. None could learn the song except the one hundred forty-four thousand, those who had been redeemed out of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.4'>These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These were redeemed by Jesus from among men, the first fruits to God and to the Lamb.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>I heard a loud voice out of the temple, saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>The first went, and poured out his bowl into the earth, and it became a harmful and evil sore on the men that had the mark of the beast, and that worshipped his image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man. Every living thing in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>The third poured out his bowl into the rivers and springs of water, and it became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>I heard the angel of the waters saying, "You are righteous, who are and who were, you Holy One, because you judged this way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>Men were scorched with great heat, and they blasphemed the name of God who has the power over these plagues. They didn`t repent and give him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>The fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was darkened. They gnawed their tongues because of the pain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their sores. They didn`t repent of their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>The sixth poured out his bowl on the great river, the Euphrates. Its water was dried up, that the way might be made ready for the kings that come from the sunrise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>I saw coming out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits, something like frogs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>for they are spirits of demons, performing signs; which go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together for the war of the great day of God, the Almighty.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>One of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come here. I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who sits on many waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality, and those who dwell in the earth were made drunken with the wine of her sexual immorality."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>He carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet-colored animal, full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>The woman was dressed in purple and scarlet, and decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup full of abominations, even the unclean things of her sexual immorality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>and on her forehead a name written, "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE PROSTITUTES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I wondered with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>The angel said to me, "Why do you wonder? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>Here is the mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains, on which the woman sits.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>The ten horns that you saw are ten kings, who have received no kingdom as yet, but they receive authority as kings, with the beast, for one hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will overcome them, for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings. They also will overcome who are with him, called and chosen and faithful."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>He said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</verse>
