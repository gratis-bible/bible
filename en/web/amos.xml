      <chapter osisID='Amos.1'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.1'>The words of Amos, who was among the herdsmen of Tekoa, which he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.2'>He said, Yahweh will roar from Zion, and utter his voice from Jerusalem; and the pastures of the shepherds shall mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.3'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Damascus, yes, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it; because they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.4'>but I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, and it shall devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.5'>I will break the bar of Damascus, and cut off the inhabitant from the valley of Aven, and him who holds the scepter from the house of Eden; and the people of Syria shall go into captivity to Kir, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.6'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Gaza, yes, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it; because they carried away captive the whole people, to deliver them up to Edom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.7'>but I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, and it shall devour the palaces of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.8'>I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him who holds the scepter from Ashkelon; and I will turn my hand against Ekron; and the remnant of the Philistines shall perish, says the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.9'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Tyre, yes, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it; because they delivered up the whole people to Edom, and didn`t remember the brotherly covenant:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.10'>but I will send a fire on the wall of Tyre, and it shall devour the palaces of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.11'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Edom, yes, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it; because he did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his wrath forever:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.12'>but I will send a fire on Teman, and it shall devour the palaces of Bozrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.13'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of the children of Ammon, yes, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it; because they have ripped up the women with child of Gilead, that they may enlarge their border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.14'>But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall devour the palaces of it, with shouting in the day of battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.1.15'>and their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes together, says Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.1'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Moab, yes, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it; because he burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.2'>but I will send a fire on Moab, and it shall devour the palaces of Kerioth; and Moab shall die with tumult, with shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.3'>and I will cut off the judge from the midst of it, and will kill all the princes of it with him, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.4'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Judah, yes, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it; because they have rejected the law of Yahweh, and have not kept his statutes, and their lies have caused them to err, after which their fathers did walk:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.5'>but I will send a fire on Judah, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.6'>Thus says Yahweh: For three transgressions of Israel, yes, for four, I will not turn away the punishment of it; because they have sold the righteous for silver, and the needy for a pair of shoes</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.7'>those who pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor, and turn aside the way of the humble: and a man and his father go to the [same] maiden, to profane my holy name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.8'>and they lay themselves down beside every altar on clothes taken in pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of such as have been fined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.9'>Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.10'>Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.11'>I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young men for Nazirites. Is it not even thus, you children of Israel? says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.12'>But you gave the Nazirites wine to drink, and commanded the prophets, saying, Don`t prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.13'>Behold, I will press [you] in your place, as a cart presses that is full of sheaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.14'>Flight shall perish from the swift; and the strong shall not strengthen his force; neither shall the mighty deliver himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.15'>neither shall he stand who handles the bow; and he who is swift of foot shall not deliver [himself]; neither shall he who rides the horse deliver himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.2.16'>and he who is courageous among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day, says Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.1'>Hear this word that Yahweh has spoken against you, children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought up out of the land of Egypt, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.2'>You only have I known of all the families of the earth: therefore I will visit on you all your iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.3'>Shall two walk together, except they have agreed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.4'>Will a lion roar in the forest, when he has no prey? will a young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.5'>Can a bird fall in a snare on the earth, where no gin is [set] for him? shall a snare spring up from the ground, and have taken nothing at all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.6'>Shall the trumpet be blown in a city, and the people not be afraid? shall evil befall a city, and Yahweh has not done it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.7'>Surely the Lord Yahweh will do nothing, except he reveal his secret to his servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.8'>The lion has roared; who will not fear? The Lord Yahweh has spoken; who can but prophesy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.9'>Publish you in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves on the mountains of Samaria, and see what great tumults are therein, and what oppressions in the midst of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.10'>For they don`t know to do right, says Yahweh, who store up violence and robbery in their palaces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.11'>Therefore thus says the Lord Yahweh: An adversary [there shall be], even round about the land; and he shall bring down your strength from you, and your palaces shall be plundered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.12'>Thus says Yahweh: As the shepherd rescues out of the mouth of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear, so shall the children of Israel be rescued that sit in Samaria in the corner of a couch, and on the silken cushions of a bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.13'>Hear you, and testify against the house of Jacob, says the Lord Yahweh, the God of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.14'>For in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of Israel on him, I will also visit the altars of Bethel; and the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.3.15'>I will strike the winter-house with the summer-house; and the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall have an end, says Yahweh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.1'>Hear this word, you cattle of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, that oppress the poor, that crush the needy, that tell their lords, Bring, and let us drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.2'>The Lord Yahweh has sworn by his holiness, that behold, the days shall come on you, that they shall take you away with hooks, and your residue with fish-hooks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.3'>You shall go out at the breaches, everyone straight before her; and you shall cast [yourselves] into Harmon, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.4'>Come to Bethel, and disobey; to Gilgal, [and] multiply disobedience; and bring your sacrifices every morning, [and] your tithes every three days;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.5'>and offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving of that which is leavened, and proclaim freewill-offerings and publish them: for this pleases you, you children of Israel, says the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.6'>I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places; yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.7'>I also have withheld the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest; and I caused it to rain on one city, and caused it not to rain on another city: one piece was rained on, and the piece whereupon it didn`t rain withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.8'>So two or three cities wandered to one city to drink water, and were not satisfied: yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.9'>I have struck you with blasting and mildew: the multitude of your gardens and your vineyards and your fig-trees and your olive-trees has the swarming locust devoured: yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.10'>I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have carried away your horses; and I have made the stench of your camp to come up even into your nostrils: yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.11'>I have overthrown [cities] among you, as when God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and you were as a brand plucked out of the burning: yet have you not returned to me, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.12'>Therefore thus will I do to you, Israel; [and] because I will do this to you, prepare to meet your God, Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.4.13'>For, behold, he who forms the mountains, and creates the wind, and declares to man what is his thought; that makes the morning darkness, and treads on the high places of the Earth Yahweh, the God of hosts, is his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.1'>Hear you this word which I take up for a lamentation over you, O house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.2'>The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is cast down on her land; there is none to raise her up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.3'>For thus says the Lord Yahweh: The city that went forth a thousand shall have a hundred left, and that which went forth one hundred shall have ten left, to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.4'>For thus says Yahweh to the house of Israel, Seek you me, and you shall live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.5'>but don`t seek Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and don`t pass to Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and Bethel shall come to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.6'>Seek Yahweh, and you shall live; lest he break out like fire in the house of Joseph, and it devour, and there be none to quench it in Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.7'>You who turn justice to wormwood, and cast down righteousness to the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.8'>[seek him] who makes the Pleiades and Orion, and turns the shadow of death into the morning, and makes the day dark with night; who calls for the waters of the sea, and pours them out on the surface of the earth (Yahweh is his name);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.9'>who brings sudden destruction on the strong, so that destruction comes on the fortress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.10'>They hate him who reproves in the gate, and they abhor him who speaks blamelessly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.11'>Forasmuch therefore as you trample on the poor, and take taxes from him of wheat: you have built houses of hewn stone, but you shall not dwell in them; you have planted pleasant vineyards, but you shall not drink the wine of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.12'>For I know how manifold are your transgressions, and how mighty are your sins-you who afflict the just, who take a bribe, and who turn aside the needy in the gate [from their right].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.13'>Therefore he who is prudent shall keep silence in such a time; for it is an evil time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.14'>Seek good, and not evil, that you may live; and so Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be with you, as you say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.15'>Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish justice in the gate: it may be that Yahweh, the God of hosts, will be gracious to the remnant of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.16'>Therefore thus says Yahweh, the God of hosts, the Lord: Wailing shall be in all the broad ways; and they shall say in all the streets, Alas! Alas! and they shall call the farmer to mourning, and such as are skillful in lamentation to wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.17'>In all vineyards shall be wailing; for I will pass through the midst of you, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.18'>Woe to you who desire the day of Yahweh! Why would you have the day of Yahweh? It is darkness, and not light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.19'>As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went into the house and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.20'>Shall the day of Yahweh not be darkness, and not light? even very dark, and no brightness in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.21'>I hate, I despise your feasts, and I will take no delight in your solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.22'>Yes, though you offer me your burnt offerings and meal-offerings, I will not accept them; neither will I regard the peace-offerings of your fat animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.23'>Take away from me the noise of your songs; for I will not hear the melody of your viols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.24'>But let justice roll down as waters, and righteousness as a mighty stream.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.25'>Did you bring to me sacrifices and offerings in the wilderness forty years, house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.26'>Yes, you have borne the tent of your king and the shrine of your images, the star of your god, which you made to yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.5.27'>Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond Damascus, says Yahweh, whose name is the God of hosts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.1'>Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, and to those who are secure in the mountain of Samaria, the notable men of the chief of the nations, to whom the house of Israel come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.2'>Pass you to Calneh, and see; and from there go you to Hamath the great; then go down to Gath of the Philistines: are they better than these kingdoms? or is their border greater than your border?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.3'>-you who put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of violence to come near;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.4'>who lie on beds of ivory, and stretch themselves on their couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves out of the midst of the stall;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.5'>who sing idle songs to the sound of the violin; who invent for themselves instruments of music, like David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.6'>who drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief oils; but they are not grieved for the affliction of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.7'>Therefore shall they now go captive with the first who go captive; and the revelry of those who stretched themselves shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.8'>The Lord Yahweh has sworn by himself, says Yahweh, the God of hosts: I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces; therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.9'>It shall happen, if there remain ten men in one house, that they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.10'>When a man`s uncle shall take him up, even he who burns him, to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall tell him who is in the innermost parts of the house, Is there yet any with you? and he shall say, No; then shall he say, Hold your peace; for we may not make mention of the name of Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.11'>For, behold, Yahweh commands, and the great house shall be struck with breaches, and the little house with clefts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.12'>Shall horses run on the rock? will one plow [there] with oxen? that you have turned justice into gall, and the fruit of righteousness into wormwood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.13'>you who rejoice in a thing of nothing, who say, Haven`t we taken to us horns by our own strength?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.6.14'>For, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, house of Israel, says Yahweh, the God of hosts; and they shall afflict you from the entrance of Hamath to the brook of the Arabah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.1'>Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and, behold, he formed locusts in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter growth; and, behold, it was the latter growth after the king`s harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.2'>It happened that, when they made an end of eating the grass of the land, then I said, Lord Yahweh, forgive, I beg you: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.3'>Yahweh repented concerning this: It shall not be, says Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.4'>Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and, behold, the Lord Yahweh called to content by fire; and it devoured the great deep, and would have eaten up the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.5'>Then said I, Lord Yahweh, cease, I beg you: how shall Jacob stand? for he is small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.6'>Yahweh repented concerning this: this also shall not be, says the Lord Yahweh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.7'>Thus he showed me: and, behold, the Lord stood beside a wall made by a plumb-line, with a plumb-line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.8'>Yahweh said to me, Amos, what see you? I said, A plumb-line. Then said the Lord, Behold, I will set a plumb-line in the midst of my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.9'>and the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.10'>Then Amaziah the priest of Beth-el sent to Jeroboam king of Israel, saying, Amos has conspired against you in the midst of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.11'>For thus Amos says, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.12'>Also Amaziah said to Amos, you seer, go, flee you away into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.13'>but don`t prophesy again any more at Bethel; for it is the king`s sanctuary, and it is a royal house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.14'>Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet, neither was I a prophet`s son; but I was a herdsman, and a dresser of sycamore-trees:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.15'>and Yahweh took me from following the flock, and Yahweh said to me, Go, prophesy to my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.16'>Now therefore hear you the word of Yahweh: You say, Don`t prophesy against Israel, and don`t drop [your word] against the house of Isaac;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.7.17'>therefore thus says Yahweh: Your wife shall be a prostitute in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be divided by line; and you yourself shall die in a land that is unclean, and Israel shall surely be led away captive out of his land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Amos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.1'>Thus the Lord Yahweh showed me: and, behold, a basket of summer fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.2'>He said, Amos, what see you? I said, A basket of summer fruit. Then said Yahweh to me, The end is come on my people Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.3'>The songs of the temple shall be wailings in that day, says the Lord Yahweh: the dead bodies shall be many: in every place shall they cast them forth with silence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Amos.8.4'>Hear this, you who would swallow up the needy, and cause the poor of the land to fail,</verse>
