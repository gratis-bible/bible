I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Behold, I will send for many fishermen, says Yahweh, and they shall fish them up; and afterward I will send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the clefts of the rocks.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For my eyes are on all their ways; they are not hidden from my face, neither is their iniquity concealed from my eyes.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>First I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double, because they have polluted my land with the carcasses of their detestable things, and have filled my inheritance with their abominations.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Yahweh, my strength, and my stronghold, and my refuge in the day of affliction, to you shall the nations come from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Our fathers have inherited nothing but lies, [even] vanity and things in which there is no profit.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Shall a man make to himself gods, which yet are no gods?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Therefore, behold, I will cause them to know, this once will I cause them to know my hand and my might; and they shall know that my name is Yahweh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
