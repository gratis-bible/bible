  <div osisID='Mark' type='book'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in the prophets, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, Who will prepare your way before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice of one crying in the wilderness, `Make ready the way of the Lord, Make his paths straight.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching the baptism of repentance for forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>There went out to him all the country of Judea, and all those of Jerusalem. They were baptized by him in the Jordan river, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>John was clothed with camel`s hair and a leather belt around his loins. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>He preached, saying, "After me comes he who is mightier than I, the thong of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and loosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I baptized you in water, but he will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>It happened in those days, that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>Immediately coming up from the water, he saw the heavens parting, and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>A voice came out of the sky, "You are my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>Immediately the Spirit drove him out into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>He was there in the wilderness forty days tempted by Satan. He was with the wild animals. The angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was taken into custody, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, "The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand! Repent, and believe in the gospel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Passing along by the sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew, the brother of Simon, casting a net in the sea, for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Jesus said to them, "Come after me, and I will make you into fishers for men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>Immediately they left their nets, and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>Going on a little further from there, he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and John, his brother, who also were in the boat mending the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>Immediately he called them, and they left their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired servants, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>They went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath day he entered into the synagogue and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>They were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as having authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>Immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, "Ha! What do we have to do with you, Jesus, you Nazarene? Have you come to destroy us? I know you who you are: the Holy One of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>The unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying with a loud voice, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>They were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, "What is this? A new teaching? For with authority he commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>The report of him went out immediately everywhere into all the region of Galilee and its surrounding area.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>Immediately, when they had come out of the synagogue, they came into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Now Simon`s wife`s mother lay sick with a fever, and immediately they told him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>He came and took her by the hand, and raised her up. The fever left her, and she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>At evening, when the sun had set, they brought to him all who were sick, and those who were possessed with demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>All the city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>He healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. He didn`t allow the demons to speak, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>Early in the night, he rose up and went out, and departed into a desert place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>Simon and those who were with him followed after him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and they found him, and told him, "All are seeking you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>He said to them, "Let`s go elsewhere into the next towns, that I may preach there also, for to this end I came forth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>He went into their synagogues throughout all Galilee, preaching and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>There came to him a leper, begging him, kneeling down to him, and saying to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Being moved with compassion, he stretched forth his hand, and touched him, and said to him, "I want to. Be made clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>When he had said this, immediately the leprosy departed from him, and he was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>He strictly charged him, and immediately sent him out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and said to him, "See you say nothing to anybody, but go show yourself to the priest, and offer for your cleansing the things which Moses commanded, for a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out, and began to proclaim it much, and to spread about the matter, so that Jesus could no more openly enter into a city, but was outside in desert places: and they came to him from everywhere.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>When he entered again into Capernaum after some days, it was heard that he was in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>Immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even around the door; and he spoke the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>Four people came, carrying a paralytic to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>When they could not come near to him for the crowd, they removed the roof where he was. When they had broken it up, they let down the mat that the paralytic was laying on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the paralytic, "Son, your sins are forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But there were some of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>"Why does this man speak blasphemies like that? He blasphemes! Who can forgive sins but one - God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, said to them, "Why do you reason these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to tell the paralytic, `Your sins are forgiven;` or to say, `Arise, and take up your bed, and walk?`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins" -- he said to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>"I tell you, arise, take up your mat, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>He arose, and immediately took up the mat, and went out in front of them all; so that they were all amazed, and glorified God, saying, "We never saw anything like this!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>He went out again by the seaside. All the multitude came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>As he passed by, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the place of toll, and he said to him, "Follow me." And he arose and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>It happened, that he was reclining at the table in his house, and many tax collectors and sinners sat down with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>The scribes and the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with the sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, "Why is it that he eats and drinks with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard it, he said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need for a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>John`s disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, and they came and asked him, "Why do John`s disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples don`t fast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jesus said to them, "Can the sons of the bride chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they can`t fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days will come, when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then will they fast in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the patch shrinks and the new tears away from the old, and a worse hole is made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>No one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine will burst the skins, and the wine pours out, and the skins will be destroyed; but they put new wine into fresh wineskins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>It happened, that he was going on the Sabbath day through the grain fields, and his disciples began, as they went, to pluck the ears of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>The Pharisees said to him, "Behold, why do they do that which is not lawful on the Sabbath day?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>He said to them, "Did you never read what David did, when he had need, and was hungry, he, and they who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he entered into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest, and ate the show bread, which it is not lawful to eat except for the priests, and gave also to those who were with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>He said to them, "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>Therefore the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>He entered again into the synagogue, and there was a man there who had his hand withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>They watched him, whether he would heal him on the Sabbath day, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>He said to the man who had his hand withered, "Stand up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath day to do good, or to do harm? To save a life, or to kill?" But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>When he had looked around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardening of their hearts, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He stretched it out, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>The Pharisees went out, and immediately took counsel with the Herodians against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>Jesus withdrew to the sea with his disciples, and a great multitude followed him from Galilee, from Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>from Jerusalem, from Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and those from around Tyre and Sidon. A great multitude, hearing what great things he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>He spoke to his disciples, that a little boat should stay near him because of the crowd, so that they wouldn`t press on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For he had healed many, so that as many as had diseases pressed on him that they might touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>The unclean spirits, whenever they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, "You are the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>He sternly warned them that they should not make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>He went up into the mountain, and called to himself whom he wanted, and they went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>He appointed twelve, that they might be with him, and that he might send them out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to heal sicknesses and to cast out demons:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>Simon, to whom he gave the name Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James the son of Zebedee; John, the brother of James, and them he surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew; Philip; Bartholomew; Matthew; Thomas; James, the son of Alphaeus; Thaddaeus; Simon the Zealot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.     He came into a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>The multitude came together again, so that they could not so much as eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When his friends heard it, they went out to lay hold on him: for they said, "He is insane."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>The scribes who came down from Jerusalem said, "He has Beelzebul," and, "By the prince of the demons he casts out the demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>He called them to him, and said to them in parables, "How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>If a house is divided against itself, that house cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>If Satan has risen up against himself, and is divided, he can`t stand, but has an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>But no one can enter into the house of the strong man to plunder, unless he first binds the strong man; and then he will plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Most assuredly I tell you, all their sins will be forgiven to the sons of men, and their blasphemies with which they may blaspheme;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever may blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>-- because they said, "He has an unclean spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>His mother and his brothers came, and standing outside, they sent to him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>A multitude was sitting around him, and they told him, "Behold, your mother, your brothers, and your sisters are outside looking for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>Looking around at those who sat around him, he said, "Behold, my mother and my brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever may do the will of God, the same is my brother, and my sister, and mother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Again he began to teach by the seaside. A great multitude was gathered to him, so that he entered into a boat in the sea, and sat down. All the multitude were on the land by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>He taught them many things in parables, and told them in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>"Listen! Behold, the farmer went forth to sow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>and it happened, as he sowed, some seed fell by the road, and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Others fell on the rocky ground, where it had little soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it had no depth of soil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>When the sun had risen, it was scorched; and because it had no root, it withered away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>Others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up, and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>Others fell into the good ground, and yielded fruit, growing up and increasing. Some brought forth thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times as much."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>He said, "Whoever has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When he was alone, those who were around him with the twelve asked him about the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>He said to them, "To you is given the mystery of the kingdom of God, but to those who are outside, all things are done in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that `seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest perhaps they should turn again, and their sins should be forgiven them.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>He said to them, "Don`t you understand this parable? How will you understand all of the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The farmer sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>These are they by the road, where the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately Satan comes, and takes away the word which has been sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>These in like manner are those who are sown on the rocky places, who, when they have heard the word, immediately receive it with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>They have no root in themselves, but endure for a while, then, when oppression or persecution arises because of the word, immediately they stumble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>Others are those who are sown among the thorns. These are those who have heard the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts of other things entering in choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>These are those who were sown on the good ground: such as hear the word, and accept it, and bear fruit, some thirty times, some sixty times, and some one hundred times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>He said to them, "Is the lamp brought to be put under a basket or under the bed? Isn`t it put on the lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hidden, except that it should be made known; neither was anything made secret, but that it should come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>He said to them, "Take heed what you hear. With whatever measure you measure, it will be measured to you, and more will be given to you who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whoever has, to him will more be given, and he who has not, from him will be taken away even that which he has."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>He said, "So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep and rise night and day, and the seed should spring up and grow, he doesn`t know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth bears fruit: first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is ripe, immediately he puts forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>He said, "How will we liken the kingdom of God? Or by what parable will we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when it is sown in the earth, though it is less than all the seeds that are on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>yet when it is sown, grows up, and becomes greater than all the herbs, and puts out great branches, so that the birds of the sky can lodge under its shadow."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>Without a parable he didn`t speak to them; but privately to his own disciples he explained all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let`s go over to the other side."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>Leaving the multitude, they took him with them, even as he was, in the boat. Other small boats were also with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>There arose a great wind storm, and the waves beat into the boat, so much that the boat was already filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>He himself was in the stern, asleep on the cushion, and they woke him up, and told him, "Teacher, don`t you care that we are dying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>He awoke, and rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Peace. Be still." The wind ceased, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>He said to them, "Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>They were greatly afraid, and said to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey him?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>They came to the other side of the sea, into the country of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>When he had come out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who had his dwelling in the tombs. Nobody could bind him any more, not even with chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he had been often bound with fetters and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the fetters broken in pieces. Nobody had the strength to tame him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out, and cutting himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>When he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and bowed down to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and crying out with a loud voice, he said, "What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, don`t torment me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he said to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>He asked him, "What is your name?"     He said to him, "My name is Legion, for we are many."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>He begged him much that he would not send them away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was there on the mountainside a great herd of pigs feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>All the demons begged him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter into them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>At once Jesus gave them permission. The unclean spirits came out, and entered into the pigs. The herd of about two thousand rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>Those who fed them fled, and told it in the city, and in the country.     The people came to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>They came to Jesus, and saw him who was possessed by demons sitting, clothed and in his right mind, even him who had the legion; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>Those who saw it declared to them how it happened to him who was possessed by demons, and about the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>They began to beg him to depart from their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>As he was entering into the boat, he who had been possessed by demons begged him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>He didn`t allow him, but said to him, "Go to your house, to your friends, and tell them how the Lord has done great things for you, and how he had mercy on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>He went his way, and began to proclaim in Decapolis how Jesus had done great things for him, and everyone marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>When Jesus had crossed back over in the boat to the other side, a great multitude was gathered to him; and he was by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>Behold, one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, came; and seeing him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and begged him much, saying, "My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her, that she may be made healthy, and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>He went with him, and a great multitude followed him, and they pressed upon him on all sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>A certain woman, who had an issue of blood for twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and had suffered many things by many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better, but rather grew worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>having heard the things concerning Jesus, came up behind him in the crowd, and touched his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, "If I just touch his clothes, I will be made well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>Immediately the fountain of her blood was dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Immediately Jesus, perceiving in himself that the power had gone forth from him, turned around in the crowd, and asked, "Who touched my clothes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>His disciples said to him, "You see the multitude pressing against you, and you say, `Who touched me?`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>He looked around to see her who had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had been done to her, came and fell down before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace, and be cured of your disease."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler`s house saying, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher any more?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, not heeding the word spoken, immediately said to the ruler of the synagogue, "Don`t be afraid, only believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>He allowed no one to follow him, except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>He came to the synagogue ruler`s house, and he saw an uproar, weeping, and great wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>When he had entered in, he said to them, "Why do you make an uproar and weep? The child is not dead, but is asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>They laughed him to scorn. But he, having put them all out, took the father of the child and her mother and those who were with him, and went in where the child was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>Taking the child by the hand, he said to her, "Talitha cumi;" which means, being interpreted, "Young lady, I tell you, get up."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>Immediately the young lady rose up, and walked, for she was twelve years old. They were amazed with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>He charged them much that no one should know this. He commanded that something should be given to her to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>He went out from there. He came into his own country, and his disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>When the Sabbath had come, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many hearing him were astonished, saying, "Where did this man get these things?" and, "What is the wisdom that is given to this man, that such mighty works come about by his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Isn`t this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Aren`t his sisters here with us?" They were offended by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor, except in his own country, and among his own relatives, and in his own house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>He could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick folk, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>He marveled because of their unbelief.     He went around the villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>He called to himself the twelve, and began to send them out two by two; and he gave them authority over the unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He charged them that they should take nothing for their journey, except a staff only: no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but to wear sandals, and not put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>He said to them, "Wherever you enter into a house, stay there until you depart from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>Whoever will not receive you nor hear you, as you depart from there, shake off the dust that is under your feet for a testimony against them. Assuredly, I tell you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>They went out, and preached that people should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>They cast out many demons, and anointed many with oil who were sick, and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>King Herod heard this, for his name had become known, and he said, "John the Baptizer has risen from the dead, and therefore these powers work in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>But others said, "It is Elijah." Others said, "It is the Prophet, or like one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But Herod, when he heard this, said, "This is John, whom I beheaded. He has risen from the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent out and laid hold on John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip`s wife, for he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John said to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother`s wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>Herodias set herself against him, and desired to kill him, but she couldn`t,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and kept him safe. When he heard him, he did many things, and he heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>When a convenient day had come, that Herod on his birthday made a supper for his lords, and the high captains, and the chief men of Galilee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>and when the daughter of Herodias herself came in and danced, she pleased Herod and those reclining with him. The king said to the young lady, "Ask me whatever you want, and I will give it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He swore to her, "Whatever you shall ask of me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>She went out, and said to her mother, "What shall I ask?"     She said, "The head of John the Baptizer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>She came in immediately with haste to the king, and asked, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptizer on a platter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>The king was exceedingly sorry, but for the sake of his oaths, and of his dinner guests, he didn`t wish to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>Immediately the king sent forth a soldier of his guard, and commanded to bring John`s head, and he went and beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the young lady; and the young lady gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When his disciples heard this, they came and took up his corpse, and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>The apostles gathered themselves together to Jesus, and they told him all things, whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>He said to them, "You come apart into a desert place, and rest awhile." For there were many coming and going, and they had no leisure so much as to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>They went away in the boat to a desert place by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>They saw them going, and many recognized him and ran there on foot from all the cities. They arrived before them and came together to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>Jesus came out, saw a great multitude, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>When it was late in the day, his disciples came to him, and said, "This place is a desert, and it is late in the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Send them away, that they may go into the surrounding country and villages, and buy themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But he answered them, "You give them something to eat."     They asked him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread, and give them something to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go see."     When they knew, they said, "Five, and two fish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>He commanded those that all should sit down by companies on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>They sat down in ranks, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, he blessed, and broke the loaves, and he gave to his disciples to set before them, and he divided the two fish among them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>They all ate, and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>They took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and also of the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Those who ate the loaves were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Immediately he made his disciples enter into the boat, and to go ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he himself sent the multitude away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>After he had taken leave of them, he departed into the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>When evening had come, the boat was in the midst of the sea, and he was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>Seeing them distressed in rowing, for the wind was contrary to them; and about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea, and he would have passed by them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>but they, when they saw him walking on the sea, supposed that it was a ghost, and cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for they all saw him, and were troubled. But he immediately spoke with them, and said to them, "Cheer up! It is I! Don`t be afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>He went up to them into the boat; and the wind ceased, and they were very amazed among themselves, and marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>for they hadn`t understood about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>When they had crossed over, they came to the land to Gennesaret, and moored to the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>When they had come out of the boat, immediately the people recognized him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>and ran around that whole region, and began to carry around those who were sick, on their mats, to where they heard he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>Wherever he entered, into villages, or into cities, or into the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and begged him that they might touch just the fringe of his garment; and as many as touched him were made well.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Then the Pharisees, and some of the scribes gathered together to him, having come from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>Now when they saw some of his disciples eating bread with defiled, that is, unwashed, hands, they found fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>(For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, don`t eat unless they wash their hands and forearms, holding to the tradition of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>They don`t eat when they come from the marketplace, unless they bathe themselves, and there are many other things, which they have received to hold to: washings of cups, pitchers, bronze vessels, and couches.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>The Pharisees and the scribes asked him, "Why don`t your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat their bread with unwashed hands?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>He answered them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, `This people honors me with their lips, But their heart is far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>But in vain do they worship me, Teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>"For you set aside the commandment of God, and hold tightly to the tradition of men -- the washing of pitchers and cups, and you do many other such things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>He said to them, "Full well do you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, `Honor your father and your mother;` and, `He who speaks evil of father or mother, let him be put to death.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, `If a man will tell his father or his mother, "Whatever you might have been profited by me is Corban, that is to say, given to God;"`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>and you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>making void the word of God by your tradition, which you have handed down. You do many things like this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>He called all the multitude to himself, and said to them, "Hear me, all of you, and understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing from outside of the man, that going into him can defile him; but the things which proceed out of the man are those that defile the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>When he had entered into the house from the multitude, his disciples asked him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>He said to them, "Are you so without understanding also? Don`t you perceive that whatever goes into the man from outside can`t defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it doesn`t go into his heart, but into his belly, and into the latrine, thus making all foods clean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>He said, "That which proceeds out of the man, that defiles the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, out of the hearts of men, proceed evil thoughts, adulteries, sexual sins, murders, thefts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>covetings, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, an evil eye, blasphemy, pride, and foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evil things proceed from within, and defile the man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>From there he arose, and went away into the borders of Tyre and Sidon. He entered into a house, and wanted no one to know it, but he couldn`t escape detection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>For a woman, whose little daughter had an unclean spirit, having heard of him, came and fell down at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syrophoenician by race. She begged him that he would cast the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not appropriate to take the children`s bread and throw it to the dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. For even the dogs under the table eat the children`s crumbs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>He said to her, "For this saying, go your way. The demon has gone out of your daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>She went away to her house, and found the child laying on the bed, with the demon gone out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Again he departed from the borders of Tyre and Sidon, and came to the sea of Galilee, through the midst of the borders of Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>They brought to him one who was deaf and had an impediment in his speech. They begged him to lay his hand on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>He took him aside from the multitude, privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>Looking up to heaven, he sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha!" that is, "Be opened!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>Immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spoke clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>He charged them that they should tell no one, but the more he charged them, so much the more widely they proclaimed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>They were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes even the deaf hear, and the mute speak!"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days, when there was a very great multitude, and they had nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples to himself, and said to them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?"     They said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>He commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground, and he took the seven loaves. Having given thanks, he broke them, and gave them to his disciples to serve, and they served the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>They had a few small fish. Having blessed them, he said to serve these also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>They ate, and were filled. They took up seven baskets of broken pieces that were left over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Those who had eaten were about four thousand. Then he sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>Immediately he entered into the boat with his disciples, and came into the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>The Pharisees came out and began to question him, seeking a sign from heaven from him, and tempting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>He sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Most assuredly I tell you, there will no sign be given to this generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>He left them, and again entering into the boat, departed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>They forgot to take bread; and they didn`t have more than one loaf in the boat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>He charged them, saying, "Take heed: beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>They reasoned with one another, saying, "It`s because we have no bread."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>He began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard, set a hedge around it, dug a pit for the winepress, built a tower, rented it out to a farmer, and went into another country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>When it was time, he sent a servant to the farmer to get from the farmer his share of the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>They took him, beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>Again, he sent another servant to them; and they threw stones at him, wounded him in the head, and sent him away shamefully treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>Again he sent another; and they killed him; and many others, beating some, and killing some.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>Therefore he had yet one, a beloved son, he sent him last to them, saying, `They will respect my son.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.7'>But those farmers said among themselves, `This is the heir. Come, let`s kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>They took him, killed him, and cast him forth out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What therefore will the lord of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the farmers, and will give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>Haven`t you even read this scripture: `The stone which the builders rejected, The same was made the head of the corner.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>They tried to seize him, but they feared the multitude; for they perceived that he spoke the parable against them. They left him, and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>They sent some of the Pharisees and of the Herodians to him, that they might catch him in words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>When they had come, they asked him, "Teacher, we know that you are honest, and don`t defer to anyone; for you aren`t partial to anyone, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Shall we give, or shall we not give?"     But he, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test me? Bring me a denarius, that I may see it."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>Jesus answered them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar`s, and to God the things that are God`s."     They marveled greatly at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>There came to him Sadducees, who say that there is no resurrection. They asked him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>"Teacher, Moses wrote to us, `If a man`s brother dies, and leaves a wife behind him, and leaves no child, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up children to his brother.`</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they will rise from the dead, they neither marry, nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>One of the scribes came, and heard them questioning together. Knowing that he had answered them well, asked him, "What commandment is the greatest of all?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered, "The greatest is, `Hear, Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength.` This is the primary commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>The second is like this, `You shall love your neighbor as yourself.` There is no other commandment greater than these."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>The scribe said to him, "Truly, teacher, you have said well that he is one, and there is none other but he,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and to love him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God."     No one dared ask him any question after that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>Jesus responded, as he taught in the temple, "How is it that the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself said in the Holy Spirit, `The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, Until I make your enemies the footstool of your feet.`</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>Therefore David himself calls him Lord, so how can he be his son?"     The common people heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>In his teaching he said to them, "Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and to get greetings in the marketplaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and chief seats in the synagogues, and chief places at feasts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>those who devour widows` houses, and for a pretense make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and saw how the multitude cast money into the treasury. Many who were rich cast in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>There came a poor widow, and she cast in two lepta, which make a quadrans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>He called his disciples to himself, and said to them, "Most assuredly I tell you, this poor widow gave more than all those who are giving into the treasury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>for they all gave out of their abundance, but she, out of her poverty, gave all that she had to live on."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>As he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked him privately,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>The cock crowed the second time. Peter remembered the word, how that Jesus said to him, "Before the cock crows twice, you will deny me three times." When he thought about that, he wept.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>Immediately in the morning the chief priests, with the elders and scribes, and the whole council, held a consultation, and bound Jesus, and carried him away, and delivered him up to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Pilate asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?"     He answered, "So you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>The chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>Pilate again asked him, "Have you no answer? See how many things they testify against you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus made no further answer, so Pilate marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at the feast he used to release to them one prisoner, whom they asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>There was one called Barabbas, bound with those who had made insurrection, men who in the insurrection had committed murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>The multitude, crying aloud, began to ask him to do as he always did for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he perceived that for envy the chief priests had delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests stirred up the multitude, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>Pilate again asked them, "What then should I do to him whom you call the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>They cried out again, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil has he done?"     But they cried out exceedingly, "Crucify him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>Pilate, wishing to please the multitude, released Barabbas to them, and delivered Jesus, when he had flogged him, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>The soldiers led him away within the court, which is the Praetorium; and they called together the whole cohort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>They clothed him with purple, and weaving a crown of thorns, they put it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>They began to salute him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>They struck his head with a reed, and spat on him, and bowing their knees, did homage to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>When they had mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>They compelled one passing by, coming from the country, Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to go with them, that he might bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>They brought him to the place called Golgotha, which is, being interpreted, "The place of a skull."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he didn`t take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>Crucifying him, they parted his garments among them, casting lots on them, what each should take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>It was the third hour, and they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>The superscription of his accusation was written over him, "THE KING OF THE JEWS."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>With him they crucified two robbers; one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>The scripture was fulfilled, which says, "He was numbered with transgressors."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself, and come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise, also the chief priests mocking among themselves with the scribes said, "He saved others. He can`t save himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, now come down from the cross, that we may see and believe him." Those who were crucified with him reproached him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>When the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>At the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lama sabachthani?" which is, being interpreted, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>Some of those who stood by, when they heard it, said, "Behold, he calls Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>One ran, and filling a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink, saying, "Let him be. Let`s see whether Elijah comes to take him down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>Jesus cried out with a loud voice, and gave up the spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>The veil of the temple was torn in two from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>When the centurion, who stood by opposite him, saw that he cried out like this and breathed his last, he said, "Truly this man was the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were also women watching from afar, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the less and of Joses, and Salome;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who, when he was in Galilee, followed him, and served him; and many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>When evening had now come, because it was the Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathaea, a member of the council of honorable estate, who also himself was looking for the kingdom of God, came. He boldly went in to Pilate, and asked for Jesus` body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>Pilate marveled if he were already dead: and calling to him the centurion, he asked him whether he had been dead for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>When he learned it from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>He bought a linen cloth, and taking him down, wound him in the linen cloth, and laid him in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock. He rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of Joses, saw where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James, and Salome, bought spices, that they might come and anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>Very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>They were saying among themselves, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>for it was very big. Looking up, they saw that the stone was rolled back</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>Entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>He said to them, "Don`t be amazed. You seek Jesus, the Nazarene, who has been crucified. He has risen. He is not here. Behold, the place where they laid him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Peter, `He goes before you into Galilee. There you will see him, as he said to you.`"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>They went out, and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had come on them. They said nothing to anyone; for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now when he had risen early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>When they heard that he was alive, and had been seen by her, they disbelieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After these things he was revealed in another form to two of them, as they walked, on their way into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>They went away and told it to the rest. They didn`t believe them, either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterward he was revealed to the eleven themselves as they sat at the table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they didn`t believe those who had seen him after he had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>He said to them, "Go into all the world, and preach the gospel to the whole creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who believes and is baptized will be saved; but he who disbelieves will be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>These signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new languages;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they will take up serpents, and if they drink any deadly thing, it will in no way hurt them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will recover."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was received up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>They went forth, and preached everywhere, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word by the signs that followed. Amen.</verse>
