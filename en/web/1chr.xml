        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.2'>Then David the king stood up on his feet, and said, Hear me, my brothers, and my people: as for me, it was in my heart to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and for the footstool of our God; and I had made ready for the building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.3'>But God said to me, You shall not build a house for my name, because you are a man of war, and have shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.28.4'>However Yahweh, the God of Israel, chose me out of all the house of my father to be king over Israel forever: for he has chosen Judah to be prince; and in the house of Judah, the house of my father; and among the sons of my father he took pleasure in me to make me king over all Israel;</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.1'>David the king said to all the assembly, Solomon my son, whom alone God has chosen, is yet young and tender, and the work is great; for the palace is not for man, but for Yahweh God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.2'>Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God the gold for the [things of] gold, and the silver for the [things of] silver, and the brass for the [things of] brass, the iron for the [things of] iron, and wood for the [things of] wood; onyx stones, and [stones] to be set, stones for inlaid work, and of various colors, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.3'>Moreover also, because I have set my affection on the house of my God, seeing that I have a treasure of my own of gold and silver, I give it to the house of my God, over and above all that I have prepared for the holy house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.4'>even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and seven thousand talents of refined silver, with which to overlay the walls of the houses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.5'>of gold for the [things of] gold, and of silver for the [things of] silver, and for all manner of work [to be made] by the hands of artificers. Who then offers willingly to consecrate himself this day to Yahweh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.6'>Then the princes of the fathers` [houses], and the princes of the tribes of Israel, and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the rulers over the king`s work, offered willingly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.7'>and they gave for the service of the house of God of gold five thousand talents and ten thousand darics, and of silver ten thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and of iron a hundred thousand talents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.8'>They with whom [precious] stones were found gave them to the treasure of the house of Yahweh, under the hand of Jehiel the Gershonite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.9'>Then the people rejoiced, because they offered willingly, because with a perfect heart they offered willingly to Yahweh: and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.10'>Therefore David blessed Yahweh before all the assembly; and David said, Blessed be you, Yahweh, the God of Israel our father, forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.11'>Yours, Yahweh, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heavens and in the earth [is your]; your is the kingdom, Yahweh, and you are exalted as head above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.12'>Both riches and honor come of you, and you rule over all; and in your hand is power and might; and in your hand it is to make great, and to give strength to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.13'>Now therefore, our God, we thank you, and praise your glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.14'>But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of you, and of your own have we given you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.15'>For we are strangers before you, and sojourners, as all our fathers were: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there is no abiding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.16'>Yahweh our God, all this store that we have prepared to build you a house for your holy name comes of your hand, and is all your own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.17'>I know also, my God, that you try the heart, and have pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of my heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have I seen with joy your people, that are present here, offer willingly to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.18'>Yahweh, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep this forever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart of your people, and prepare their heart to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.19'>and give to Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep your commandments, your testimonies, and your statutes, and to do all these things, and to build the palace, for which I have made provision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.20'>David said to all the assembly, Now bless Yahweh your God. All the assembly blessed Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped Yahweh, and the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.21'>They sacrificed sacrifices to Yahweh, and offered burnt offerings to Yahweh, on the next day after that day, even one thousand bulls, one thousand rams, and one thousand lambs, with their drink-offerings, and sacrifices in abundance for all Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.22'>and ate and drink before Yahweh on that day with great gladness. They made Solomon the son of David king the second time, and anointed him to Yahweh to be prince, and Zadok to be priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.23'>Then Solomon sat on the throne of Yahweh as king instead of David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.24'>All the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons likewise of king David, submitted themselves to Solomon the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.25'>Yahweh magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all Israel, and bestowed on him such royal majesty as had not been on any king before him in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.26'>Now David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.27'>The time that he reigned over Israel was forty years; seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty-three [years] reigned he in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.28'>He died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and honor: and Solomon his son reigned in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.29'>Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they are written in the history of Samuel the seer, and in the history of Nathan the prophet, and in the history of Gad the seer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Chr.29.30'>with all his reign and his might, and the times that went over him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the countries.</verse>
