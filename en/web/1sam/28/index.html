Achish said to David, Know you assuredly, that you shall go out with me in the host, you and your men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>David said to Achish, Therefore you shall know what your servant will do. Achish said to David, Therefore will I make you keeper of my head for ever.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Now Samuel was dead, and all Israel had lamented him, and buried him in Ramah, even in his own city. Saul had put away those who had familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>The Philistines gathered themselves together, and came and encamped in Shunem: and Saul gathered all Israel together, and they encamped in Gilboa.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>When Saul saw the host of the Philistines, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>When Saul inquired of Yahweh, Yahweh didn`t answer him, neither by dreams, nor by Urim, nor by prophets.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Then said Saul to his servants, Seek me a woman who has a familiar spirit, that I may go to her, and inquire of her. His servants said to him, Behold, there is a woman who has a familiar spirit at En-dor.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Saul disguised himself, and put on other clothing, and went, he and two men with him, and they came to the woman by night: and he said, Please divine to me by the familiar spirit, and bring me up whoever I shall name to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>The woman said to him, Behold, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off those who have familiar spirits, and the wizards, out of the land: why then lay you a snare for my life, to cause me to die?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Saul swore to her by Yahweh, saying, As Yahweh lives, there shall no punishment happen to you for this thing.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then said the woman, Whom shall I bring up to you? He said, Bring me up Samuel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>When the woman saw Samuel, she cried with a loud voice; and the woman spoke to Saul, saying, Why have you deceived me? for you are Saul.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The king said to her, Don`t be afraid: for what do you see? The woman said to Saul, I see a god coming up out of the earth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>He said to her, What form is he of? She said, An old man comes up; and he is covered with a robe. Saul perceived that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground, and did obeisance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Samuel said to Saul, Why have you disquieted me, to bring me up? Saul answered, I am sore distressed; for the Philistines make war against me, and God is departed from me, and answers me no more, neither by prophets, nor by dreams: therefore I have called you, that you may make known to me what I shall do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Samuel said, Why then do you ask of me, seeing Yahweh is departed from you, and is become your adversary?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Yahweh has done to you, as he spoke by me: and Yahweh has torn the kingdom out of your hand, and given it to your neighbor, even to David.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Because you didn`t obey the voice of Yahweh, and didn`t execute his fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore has Yahweh done this thing to you this day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Moreover Yahweh will deliver Israel also with you into the hand of the Philistines; and tomorrow shall you and your sons be with me: Yahweh will deliver the host of Israel also into the hand of the Philistines.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then Saul fell immediately his full length on the earth, and was sore afraid, because of the words of Samuel: and there was no strength in him; for he had eaten no bread all the day, nor all the night.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>The woman came to Saul, and saw that he was sore troubled, and said to him, Behold, your handmaid has listened to your voice, and I have put my life in my hand, and have listened to your words which you spoke to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Now therefore, please listen also to the voice of your handmaid, and let me set a morsel of bread before you; and eat, that you may have strength, when you go on your way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>But he refused, and said, I will not eat. But his servants, together with the woman, constrained him; and he listened to their voice. So he arose from the earth, and sat on the bed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>The woman had a fattened calf in the house; and she hurried, and killed it; and she took flour, and kneaded it, and did bake unleavened bread of it:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>and she brought it before Saul, and before his servants; and they ate. Then they rose up, and went away that night.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
