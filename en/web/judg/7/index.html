There returned of the people twenty-two thousand; and there remained ten thousand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Yahweh said to Gideon, The people are yet too many; bring them down to the water, and I will try them for you there: and it shall be, that of whom I tell you, This shall go with you, the same shall go with you; and of whoever I tell you, This shall not go with you, the same shall not go.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>So he brought down the people to the water: and Yahweh said to Gideon, Everyone who laps of the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, him shall you set by himself; likewise everyone who bows down on his knees to drink.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>The number of those who lapped, putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men: but all the rest of the people bowed down on their knees to drink water.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Yahweh said to Gideon, By the three hundred men who lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into your hand; and let all the people go every man to his place.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets; and he sent all the men of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the three hundred men: and the camp of Midian was beneath him in the valley.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>It happened the same night, that Yahweh said to him, Arise, get you down into the camp; for I have delivered it into your hand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>But if you fear to go down, go you with Purah your servant down to the camp:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and you shall hear what they say; and afterward shall your hands be strengthened to go down into the camp. Then went he down with Purah his servant to the outermost part of the armed men who were in the camp.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of the east lay along in the valley like locusts for multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand which is on the sea-shore for multitude.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>When Gideon had come, behold, there was a man telling a dream to his fellow; and he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream; and, behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian, and came to the tent, and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>His fellow answered, This is nothing else save the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: into his hand God has delivered Midian, and all the host.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>It was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and the interpretation of it, that he worshipped; and he returned into the camp of Israel, and said, Arise; for Yahweh has delivered into your hand the host of Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put into the hands of all of them trumpets, and empty pitchers, with torches within the pitchers.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>He said to them, Look on me, and do likewise: and, behold, when I come to the outermost part of the camp, it shall be that, as I do, so shall you do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow you the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and say, For Yahweh and for Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>So Gideon, and the hundred men who were with him, came to the outermost part of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch, when they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the trumpets, and broke in pieces the pitchers that were in their hands.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>The three companies blew the trumpets, and broke the pitchers, and held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands with which to blow; and they cried, The sword of Yahweh and of Gideon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>They stood every man in his place round about the camp; and all the host ran; and they shouted, and put [them] to flight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>They blew the three hundred trumpets, and Yahweh set every man`s sword against his fellow, and against all the host; and the host fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>The men of Israel were gathered together out of Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and pursued after Midian.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill-country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against Midian, and take before them the waters, as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were gathered together, and took the waters as far as Beth-barah, even the Jordan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>They took the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb; and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian: and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon beyond the Jordan.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
