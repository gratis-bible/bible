Behold, in the day of your fast you find pleasure, and exact all your labors.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Behold, you fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the fist of wickedness: you shall not fast as you do this day, to make your voice to be heard on high.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? will you call this a fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppressed go free, and that you break every yoke?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>Is it not to deal your bread to the hungry, and that you bring the poor that are cast out to your house? when you see the naked, that you cover him; and that you hide not yourself from your own flesh?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Then shall your light break forth as the morning, and your health shall spring forth speedily: and your righteousness shall go before you; the glory of the LORD shall be your rear guard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Then shall you call, and the LORD shall answer; you shall cry, and he shall say, Here I am.
