And when he had spoken this word to me, I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he to me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day that you did set your heart to understand, and to chasten yourself before your God, your words were heard, and I am come for your words.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days: but, see, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I am come to make you understand what shall befall your people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many days.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And when he had spoken such words to me, I set my face toward the ground, and I became dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spoke, and said to him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my sorrows are turned on me, and I have retained no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither is there breath left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be to you, be strong, yes, be strong. And when he had spoken to me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for you have strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said he, Know you why I come to you? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I am gone forth, see, the prince of Grecia shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will show you that which is noted in the scripture of truth: and there is none that holds with me in these things, but Michael your prince.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
