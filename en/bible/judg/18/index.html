Then said the priest to them, What do you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And they said to him, Hold your peace, lay your hand on your mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest: is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or that you be a priest to a tribe and a family in Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And the priest' heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the middle of the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the cattle and the carriage before them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men that were in the houses near to Micah' house were gathered together, and overtook the children of Dan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they cried to the children of Dan. And they turned their faces, and said to Micah, What ails you, that you come with such a company?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And he said, You have taken away my gods which I made, and the priest, and you are gone away: and what have I more? and what is this that you say to me, What ails you?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And the children of Dan said to him, Let not your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows run on you, and you lose your life, with the lives of your household.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his house.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest which he had, and came to Laish, to a people that were at quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and burnt the city with fire.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley that lies by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelled therein.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of Dan their father, who was born to Israel: however, the name of the city was Laish at the first.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan, the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>And they set them up Micah' graven image, which he made, all the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
