        <verse osisID='Tob.1.3'>{\cf2 For wicked thoughts separate from God: and his power when it is tried, reprooueth the vnwise,}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.4'>{\cf2 Because wisdome cannot enter into a wicked heart, nor dwell in the body that is subiect vnto sinne.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.5'>{\cf2 For the holy Spirit of discipline fleeth from deceite, &amp; withdraweth himselfe from the thoughts that are without vnderstanding, and is rebuked when wickednes commeth.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.6'>{\cf2 For the Spirit of wisdome is louing, and wil not absolue him, that blasphemeth with his lips: for God is a witnes of his reines, and a true beholder of his heart, and an hearer of the tongue.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.7'>{\cf2 For the Spirite of the Lorde filleth all the world: and the same that mainteineth all things, hath knowledge of the voyce.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.8'>{\cf2 Therefore hee that speaketh vnrighteous things, cannot be hid: neither shall the iudgement of reproche let him escape.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.9'>{\cf2 For inquisition shalbe made for the thoughts of the vngodly, and the sound of his wordes shall come vnto God for the correction of his iniquities.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.10'>{\cf2 For the eare of ielousie heareth al things, and the noyse of the grudgings shall not be hid.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.11'>{\cf2 Therefore beware of murmuring, which profiteth nothing, and refraine your tongue from slander: for there is no worde so secret, that shal go for nought, and the mouth that speaketh lyes, slayeth the soule.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.12'>{\cf2 Seeke not death in the errour of your life: destroy not your selues thorowe the workes of your owne hands.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.13'>{\cf2 For God hath not made death, neither hath he pleasure in the destruction of the liuing.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.14'>{\cf2 For he created all things, that they might haue their being: and the generations of the world are preserued, and there is no poyson of destruction in them, &amp; the kingdome of hell is not vpon earth.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.15'>{\cf2 For righteousnes is immortall, but vnrighteousnes bringeth death.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.1.16'>{\cf2 And the vngodly call it vnto them both with hands and wordes: and while they thinke to haue a friend of it, they come to naught: for they are confederate with it: therefore are they worthy to be partakers thereof.}</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.2.1'>{\cf2 For the vngodly say, as they falsly imagine with themselues, Our life is short &amp; tedious: and in the death of a man there is no recouerie, neither was any knowen that hath returned from the graue.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.2'>{\cf2 For we are borne at all aduenture, and we shall be hereafter as though we had neuer bene: for the breath is a smoke in our nostrels, &amp; the wordes as a sparke raised out of our heart,}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.3'>{\cf2 Which being extinguished, the body is turned into ashes, and the Spirite vanisheth as the soft ayre.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.4'>{\cf2 Our life shall passe away as the trace of a cloude, and come to naught as the miste that is driuen away with the beames of the sunne, and cast downe with the heate thereof. Our name also shall be forgotten in time, and no man shall haue our workes in remembrance.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.5'>{\cf2 For our time is as a shadow that passeth away, and after our ende there is no returning: for it is fast sealed, so that no man commeth againe.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.6'>{\cf2 Come therefore, and let vs enioy the pleasures, that are present, and let vs cheerefully vse the creatures as in youth.}</verse>

        <verse osisID='Tob.2.10'>{\cf2 Let vs oppresse the poore that is righteous: let vs not spare the widdow, nor reuerence ye white heares of the aged, that haue liued many yeeres.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.11'>{\cf2 Let our strength be the lawe of vnrighteousnes: for the thing that is feeble, is reprooued as vnprofitable.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.12'>{\cf2 Therefore let vs defraude the righteous: for he is not for our profite, and he is contrary to our doings: hee checketh vs for offending against the Law, and blameth vs as transgressers of discipline.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.13'>{\cf2 He maketh his boast to haue the knowledge of God: &amp; he calleth himselfe the sonne of ye Lord.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.14'>{\cf2 He is made to reprooue our thoughtes.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.15'>{\cf2 It grieueth vs also to looke vpon him: for his life is not like other mens: his wayes are of another fashion.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.16'>{\cf2 He counteth vs as bastards, and hee withdraweth himselfe from our wayes as from filthines: he commendeth greatly the latter end of the iust, and boasteth that God is his father.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.17'>{\cf2 Let vs see then if his wordes be true: let vs prooue what ende he shall haue.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.18'>{\cf2 For if the righteous man be the sonne of God, hee wil helpe him, and deliuer him from the hands of his enemies.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.19'>{\cf2 Let vs examine him with rebukes and torments that we may know his meekenes, &amp; prooue his patience.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.20'>{\cf2 Let vs condemne him vnto a shamefull death: for he shalbe preserued as he himselfe sayth.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.21'>{\cf2 Such things doe they imagine, and go astray: for their owne wickednes hath blinded them.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.22'>{\cf2 And they doe not vnderstand the mysteries of God, neither hope for the reward of righteousnes, nor can discerne the honour of the soules that are faultles.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.23'>{\cf2 For God created man without corruption, and made him after the image of his owne likenes.}</verse>
        <verse osisID='Tob.2.24'>{\cf2 Neuertheles, thorowe enuie of the deuill came death into the world: and they that holde of his side, prooue it.}</verse>
