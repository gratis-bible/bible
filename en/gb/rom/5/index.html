For if through the offence of  one many be dead, much more the grace of God, and the gift by grace, [which is] by one man, Jesus Christ, hath abounded unto many.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And not as [it was] by one that sinned, [so is] the gift: for the judgment [was] by one to condemnation, but the free gift [is] of many offences unto  justification.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For if by one man's offence death reigned by one; much more they which receive abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness shall  reign in life by one, Jesus Christ.)</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Therefore as by the offence of one [judgment came] upon all men to condemnation; even so by the righteousness of one [the free gift came] upon all men unto  justification of life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>For as by one man's  disobedience  many were made sinners, so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Moreover the law  entered, that the offence might abound. But where sin abounded, grace did much more  abound:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>That as sinne had reigned vnto death, so might grace also reigne by righteousnesse vnto eternall life, through Iesus Christ our Lord.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
