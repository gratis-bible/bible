As whirlwinds in the south pass through; [so] it cometh from the desert,  from a terrible land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>A grievous vision is declared to me; the  treacherous dealer dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O  Elam: besiege, O Media; all her sighing have I made  to cease.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Therefore are my  loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed down at the hearing [of it]; I was dismayed at the seeing [of it].</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>My heart panted, fearfulness terrified me: the night  of my pleasure hath he turned into fear to me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink:  arise, ye princes, [and] anoint the shield.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For thus hath the  Lord said to me, Go, set a watchman, let him declare what he seeth.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And he saw a chariot [with] a couple of horsemen, a chariot of donkeys, [and]  a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently with much heed:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And he cried, A  lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my post whole nights:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, [with] a couple of horsemen. And  he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>O  my threshing, and the grain of my floor: that which I have heard from the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared to you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>The burden of  Dumah. He calleth to me out of  Seir, Watchman, what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>The watchman said, The  morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>The burden upon Arabia. In  the forest in Arabia shall ye lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought  water to him that was thirsty, they met with their bread him that fled.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>For they flee from the drawen swords, euen from the drawen sword, & from the bent bowe, and from the grieuousnesse of warre.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>For thus hath the Lord said to me, Within a year,  according to the years of an  hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall fail:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And the remainder of the number of archers, the mighty men of the children of  Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God of Israel hath spoken [it].</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
