The Common Edition: New Testament
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The Common Edition is the result of a decade long study of the New Testament
  and numerous English translations in the modern church. The goals for this
  edition are:

        1.  To be accurate to the Greek Scriptures and yet highly readable, 

        2.  To balance traditional wording with modern English, and

        3.  To reflect the standard Christian understanding and wording of the
            New Testament.

  The purpose of these goals is to create a standardized New Testament for the
  modern English reader.

  There are two ways to create a standardized text. [The first way] is to
  create a text of such surpassing scholarship and expression that it
  practically eliminates the use of other editions for decades or perhaps
  centuries. [The second way] is to isolate what the most widely used
  editions have in common, eliminate what they do not have in common, and
  place the results in a single text.

  
  The King James Version succeeded in both of these two ways.

  Over the past hundred years there have been numerous attempts to create a
  new English standard Bible. Each of these attempts has sought to produce a
  standardized edition in the first way I have described. The Common Edition
  New Testament follows the second method.

  A standardized edition of any work seeks a balance between extremes. The
  most literally accurate version may not be the easiest to read. The most
  traditionally worded may not be very modern.

  It cannot have a target audience; what is best for preachers and theologians
  may not be best for the daily devotional reader.

  Finally, a standardized edition cannot be innovative. One reviewer gave me
  the highest compliment I could receive when he said, "there's nothing new
  about it!"

  I hope that readers will find in these pages exactly what they would expect
  from a standardized edition, and that no matter what versions they have used
  in the past, they will find something familiar here.

   
  This initial release into the public domain is intended for free
  distribution. The text itself is copyrighted, with the following provisions:

        1.  The Common Edition: New Testament may be copied and distributed in
            electronic or printed form for free.

        2.  It may be bound or downloaded for personal use or for a gift.

        3.  It may not be sold by anyone other than the editor. 

        4.  The text may not be altered.

        5.  No more than 10,000 words may be included in a document published
            for sale without the express written permission of the editor.

        6.  No more than 20% of a document published for sale may be quoted
            from this edition without the express written permission of the
            editor. 

        7.  All distributions of the Common Edition, and all documents which
            quote the Common Edition, must contain the following copyright
            notice: Common Edition New Testament, Copyright © Timothy E.
            Clontz 1999. All rights reserved.

  If you find a phrase or word which is unclear, or which you believe needs
  review, please email the editor at {teclontz@aol.com}.

   
  Although it is not appropriate to dedicate a New Testament to any
  individual, the editor would like to give his gratitude to the many people
  who have labored to preserve this text. Those who penned the autographs
  often faced ridicule or death. Nameless monks sleep in the dust, who
  faithfully copied one manuscript to another down through the centuries. By
  the time of the Reformation, William Tyndale had one wish: to make the
  Christian Bible available in English to the poorest farmhand in England. For
  this crime he was strangled and burned at the stake.

  And then there are those who have simply loved these words enough to live by
  their highest ideals. Without the goodness of their lives no one would
  believe there to be anything Holy about a Bible. One such godly man was M.
  D. Barefield, who learned to read as an adult just so that he could make
  this word his own. My grandfather, Bill Clontz, who will always be an
  example for my family, gradually bought larger and larger print Bibles and
  finally began using the Bible on tape - just to keep the Word fresh in his
  heart. Such people always stay fresh in the hearts of those who have known
  them, and their love for God is contagious.

  <div type='book' osisID='John'>
      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>He was with God in the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made through him, and without him nothing was made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came for a witness, to bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light, but came to bear witness of the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>The true light that gives light to every man was coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world did not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of blood nor of the will of the flesh nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John bore witness of him and cried out, saying, »This was he of whom I said, He who comes after me ranks before me, for he was before me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And from his fullness have we all received, grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has ever seen God; God the only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>Now this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem to ask him, »Who are you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He confessed, he did not deny, but confessed, »I am not the Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, »What then? Are you Elijah?« He said, »I am not.« »Are you the prophet?« And he answered, »No.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>Then they said to him, »Who are you? Give us an answer for those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, »I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness,Make straight the way of the Lord, as the prophet Isaiah said.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now they had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>They asked him, »Then why do you baptize, if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the prophet?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, »I baptize with water, but there stands One among you whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>It is he who comes after me, the thong of whose sandal I am not worthy to untie.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>This took place in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, »Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who ranks before me, for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>I myself did not know him; but for this I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed to Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bore witness, »I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I did not know him, but he who sent me to baptize with water said to me, He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain, this is he who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen and testified that this is the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again the next day John was standing with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And he looked at Jesus as he walked, and said, »Behold, the Lamb of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples heard him say this, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, »What do you seek?« They said to him, »Rabbi« (which means Teacher), »where are you staying?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, »Come and see.« They came and saw where he was staying; and they stayed with him that day, for it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, »We have found the Messiah« (which means the Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He brought him to Jesus. Jesus looked at him and said, »You are Simon son of John. You shall be called Cephas« (which means Peter).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>The next day Jesus wanted to go to Galilee. And he found Philip and said to him, »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, »We have found him of whom Moses in the law, and also the prophets, wrote  Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, »Can anything good come out of Nazareth?« Philip said to him, »Come and see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward him, and said of him, »Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no deceit!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to him, »How do you know me?« Jesus answered him, »Before Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered him, »Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered him, »Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, do you believe? You shall see greater things than these.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he said to him, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>On the third day there was a wedding at Cana in Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>And Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>When the wine was gone, the mother of Jesus said to him, »They have no wine.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jesus said to her, »Woman, what have you to do with me? My hour has not yet come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother said to the servants, »Do whatever he tells you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now six stone jars were standing there, according to the manner for purification of the Jews, each holding twenty or thirty gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus said to them, »Fill the jars with water.« And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>He said to them, »Now draw some out, and take it to the master of the feast.« So they took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>When the master of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and did not know where it had come from (though the servants who had drawn the water knew), the master of the feast called the bridegroom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>And he said to him, »Every man sets out the good wine first; and when the guests have drunk freely, then the poor wine; but you have kept the good wine until now.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This, the first of his signs, Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, with his mother and his brothers and his disciples; and there they stayed for a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>The Passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>In the temple he found those who were selling oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers at their business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And he made a whip of cords, and drove them all, with the sheep and oxen, out of the temple; and he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And he said to those who sold doves, »Take these things away! You shall not make my Father's house a house of merchandise!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it was written, »Zeal for your house will consume me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>Then the Jews said to him, »What sign do you show to us, since you do this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered them, »Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews then said, »It has taken forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he was speaking of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this; and they believed the scripture and the word which Jesus had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself to them, because he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and he had no need for anyone to bear witness of man, for he knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, »Rabbi, we know that you are a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered him, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus said to him, »How can a man be born when he is old? Can he enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear the sound of it, but you cannot tell where it comes from or where it goes. So it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus said to him, »How can this be?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered him, »Are you the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know, and testify to what we have seen; but you do not receive our testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I have told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>No one has ascended into heaven, but he who came from heaven  the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God did not send his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through him might be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believes in him is not condemned; but he who does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment, that the light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one who does evil hates the light, and does not come to the light, lest his deeds should be exposed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who does the truth comes to the light, that it may be clearly seen that his deeds have been done in God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After this Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and there he remained with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>Now John also was baptizing at Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John had not yet been put in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>Now a discussion arose between some of John's disciples and a Jew over purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to John and said to him, »Rabbi, he who was with you beyond the Jordan, to whom you have testifiedbehold, he is baptizing, and all are going to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered, »A man can receive only what is given to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but I have been sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom's voice. Therefore this joy of mine is now full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>»He who comes from above is above all; he who is of the earth belongs to the earth, and of the earth he speaks. He who comes from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>He testifies to what he has seen and heard; yet no one receives his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He who has received his testimony has certified that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for God gives the Spirit without measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believes in the Son has eternal life; he who does not obey the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>Now when the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(although Jesus himself did not baptize, but only his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea and departed again to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>Now he had to go through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>So he came to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar, near the plot of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Jacob's well was there, and Jesus, wearied as he was from his journey, sat down by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Jesus said to her, »Give me a drink.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples had gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>Then the woman of Samaria said to him, »How is it that you, being a Jew, ask a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?« For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered her, »If you knew the gift of God, and who it is that is saying to you, Give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman said to him, »Sir, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep. Where do you get that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Are you greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank from it himself, as well as his sons and his cattle?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered her, »Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst. The water that I shall give him will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman said to him, »Sir, give me this water, that I may not thirst, nor come here to draw.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus said to her, »Go, call your husband, and come here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered, »I have no husband.« Jesus said to her, »You are right in saying, I have no husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband; this you have said truly.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman said to him, »Sir, I perceive that you are a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, and you Jews say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus said to her, »Woman, believe me, the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem will you worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>You worship what you do not know; we worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for such the Father seeks to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman said to him, »I know that Messiah is coming« (who is called Christ). »When he comes, he will tell us all things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus said to her, »I who speak to you am he.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>Just then his disciples came. And they marveled that he was talking with a woman, but no one said, »What do you wish?« or, »Why are you talking with her?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>Then the woman left her water jar, and went away into the city, and said to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>»Come, see a man who told me all that I ever did. Could this be the Christ?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out of the city and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Meanwhile his disciples urged him, saying, »Rabbi, eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, »I have food to eat of which you do not know.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>So the disciples said to one another, »Has any one brought him food?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus said to them, »My food is to do the will of him who sent me, and to finish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Do you not say, There are yet four months and then comes the harvest? Behold, I tell you, lift up your eyes, and look at the fields! They are already white for harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he who reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that sower and reaper may rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For here the saying is true, One sows and another reaps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that for which you have not labored; others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the woman's testimony, »He told me all that I ever did.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans came to him, they urged him to stay with them; and he stayed there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>They said to the woman, »We no longer believe just because of what you said; now we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this man is indeed the Savior of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>After the two days he departed to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So when he came to Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all that he had done in Jerusalem at the feast, for they too had gone to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine. And at Capernaum there was an official whose son was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and begged him to come down and heal his son, for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus said to him, »Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The official said to him, »Sir, come down before my child dies.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus said to him, »Go; your son will live.« The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him and went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>As he was going down, his servants met him and told him that his son was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he inquired of them the hour when his son got better, and they said to him, »Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus had said to him, »Your son will live.« And he himself believed, and all his household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This was now the second sign that Jesus did when he had come from Judea to Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After this there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a multitude of disabled people, blind, lame, paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'/>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>One man who was there had been an invalid for thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had been in this condition for a long time, he said to him, »Do you want to be made well?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man answered him, »Sir, I have no man to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up; but while I am coming, another steps down before me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, »Rise, take up your bed, and walk.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed and walked. Now that day was the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>So the Jews said to the man who was cured, »It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered them, »The man who made me well said to me, Take up your bed, and walk.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him, »Who is the man who said to you, Take up your bed, and walk?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had withdrawn, as there was a crowd in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward, Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, »See, you are well. Sin no more, so that nothing worse may happen to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>For this reason the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, »My Father is working still, and I am working.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because he not only broke the Sabbath, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son can do nothing of himself, but only what he sees the Father doing; for whatever he does, the Son also does.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows him all things that he himself does; and he will show him greater works than these, that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises the dead and gives life to them, even so the Son gives life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judges no one, but has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all may honor the Son just as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word and believes him who sent me, has eternal life; and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Truly, truly, I say to you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those who hear will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father has life in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has given him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Do not marvel at this; for the hour is coming when all who are in the graves will hear his voice</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and come forth  those who have done good, to the resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>»I can do nothing of myself; as I hear, I judge; and my judgment is just, because I seek not my own will but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>»If I bear witness of myself, my testimony is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who bears witness of me, and I know that the testimony which he bears of me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You have sent to John, and he has borne witness to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>Not that the testimony which I receive is from man; but I say this that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a time in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But the testimony which I have is greater than that of John; for the works which the Father has given me to finish, these very works which I am doing, bear witness of me, that the Father has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who sent me has himself testified of me. You have never heard his voice, nor seen his form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And you do not have his word abiding in you, for you do not believe him whom he has sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the Scriptures, because in them you think that you have eternal life; and these are they that testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>Yet you refuse to come to me that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>»I do not receive glory from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that you do not have the love of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in my Father's name, and you do not receive me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory that comes from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I shall accuse you to the Father; it is Moses who accuses you, on whom you set your hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he wrote about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe my words?«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After this Jesus went to the other side of the Sea of Galilee, which is the Sea of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a great multitude followed him, because they saw his signs which he performed on those who were diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>Jesus went up on the mountain, and there sat down with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Then Jesus lifted up his eyes, and seeing a great multitude coming toward him, he said to Philip, »Where shall we buy bread, that these people may eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But this he said to test him, for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, »Two hundred denarii would not buy enough bread for each one of them to have a little.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>»There is a lad here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they among so many?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jesus said, »Make the people sit down.« Now there was much grass in the place; so the men sat down, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated; so also the fish, as much as they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they had eaten their fill, he said to his disciples, »Gather up the fragments left over, that nothing may be lost.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with the fragments of the five barley loaves, left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>When the people saw the sign that Jesus did, they said, »Surely this is the Prophet who is to come into the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. It was now dark, and Jesus had not yet come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>The sea rose because a strong wind was blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>So when they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near the boat; and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But he said to them, »It is I; do not be afraid.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they were glad to take him into the boat, and immediately the boat was at the land where they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day the people who remained on the other side of the sea saw that there had been only one boat there, and that Jesus had not entered the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had gone away alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>However, boats from Tiberias came near the place where they ate the bread after the Lord had given thanks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>So when the people saw that Jesus was not there, nor his disciples, they also got into the boats and went to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>When they found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, »Rabbi, when did you come here?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate your fill of the loaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Do not labor for the food which perishes, but for the food which endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for on him has God the Father set his seal.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then they said to him, »What must we do, to be doing the works of God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered them, »This is the work of God, that you believe in him whom he has sent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>So they said to him, »What sign will you perform then, that we may see it and believe you? What work will you do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the desert; as it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jesus then said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven; but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is he who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then they said to him, »Lord, give us this bread always.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said to them, »I am the bread of life. He who comes to me shall never hunger, and he who believes in me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I said to you that you have seen me and yet do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives me will come to me, and the one who comes to me I will by no means cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of him who sent me, that I should lose nothing of all that he has given me, but raise it up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>The Jews then began to murmur about him, because he said, »I am the bread which came down from heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>They said, »Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How does he now say, I have come down from heaven?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus answered them, »Do not murmur among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, And they shall all be taught by God. Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that any one has seen the Father except the one who is from God; he has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes has everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that a man may eat of it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live for ever; and the bread which I shall give for the life of the world is my flesh.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, »How can this man give us his flesh to eat?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>So Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you have no life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For my flesh is food indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>As the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on me will live because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna and died. He who eats this bread will live for ever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>This he said in the synagogue as he taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Many of his disciples, when they heard it, said, »This is a hard saying; who can listen to it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>When Jesus knew in himself that his disciples complained about this, he said to them, »Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What then if you should see the Son of Man ascend to where he was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe.« For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe, and who would betray him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And he said, »This is why I told you that no one can come to me unless it has been granted to him by the Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From this time many of his disciples went back and no longer walked with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then Jesus said to the twelve, »Do you also want to go away?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>Simon Peter answered him, »Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>And we believe, and have come to know, that you are the Holy One of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>Jesus answered them, »Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>He spoke of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon, for it was he who was to betray him, though one of the twelve.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>After this Jesus went about in Galilee; he would not go about in Judea, because the Jews sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jews' feast of Tabernacles was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>So his brothers said to him, »Leave here and go to Judea, that your disciples may see the works you are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one works in secret if he seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For even his brothers did not believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Jesus said to them, »My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify of it that its works are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>You go up to the feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, for my time has not yet fully come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>Having said this, he remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But after his brothers had gone up to the feast, then he also went up, not publicly, but in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>The Jews were looking for him at the feast, and saying, »Where is he?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much complaining among the people about him. Some said, »He is a good man«; others said, »No, on the contrary, he deceives the people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>However, no one spoke openly of him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>Now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews marveled, saying, »How did this man get such learning, having never studied?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Jesus answered them, »My teaching is not mine, but his who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If anyone is willing to do his will, he shall know whether the teaching is from God or whether I speak on my own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>He who speaks from himself seeks his own glory; but he who seeks the glory of the One who sent him is true, and in him there is no falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law. Why do you seek to kill me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The people answered, »You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered them, »I did one deed, and you all marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Moses therefore gave you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If on the Sabbath a man receives circumcision, so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because on the Sabbath I made a man's whole body well?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge by appearances, but judge with right judgment.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Then some of the people of Jerusalem said, »Is not this the man whom they seek to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>Here he is, speaking publicly, and they say nothing to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that he is the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>But we know where this man is from; when the Christ comes, no one will know where he is from.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Then Jesus cried out, as he taught in the temple, »You know me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come on my own, but he who sent me is true, and him you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>But I know him, for I am from him, and he sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Then they sought to take him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>And many of the people believed in him, and they said, »When the Christ comes, will he do more signs than this man has done?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd muttering these things about him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent officers to arrest him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Then Jesus said to them, »I shall be with you a little while longer, and then I go to him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You will seek me, and you will not find me; where I am you cannot come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>The Jews said to one another, »Where does this man intend to go that we shall not find him? Does he intend to go to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What does he mean when he said, You will seek me and you will not find me, and, Where I am you cannot come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>On the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, »If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, out of his heart will flow rivers of living water.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.39'>Now this he said about the Spirit, whom those who believed in him were to receive; for as yet the Spirit had not been given, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.40'>When they heard these words, some of the people said, »Surely this is the prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.41'>Others said, »This is the Christ.« But some said, »Will the Christ come from Galilee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.42'>Has not the scripture said that the Christ comes from David, and from Bethlehem, the town where David was?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.43'>So there was a division among the people because of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.44'>Some of them wanted to seize him, but no one laid hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.45'>The officers then went back to the chief priests and Pharisees, who said to them, »Why did you not bring him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.46'>The officers answered, »No man ever spoke like this man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.47'>The Pharisees answered them, »Are you deceived, you also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.48'>Have any of the rulers or of the Pharisees believed in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.49'>But this crowd that does not know the law is accursed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.50'>Nicodemus, who had gone to Jesus before, and who was one of them, said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.51'>»Does our law judge a man without first giving him a hearing and learning what he is doing?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.52'>They replied, »Are you from Galilee, too? Search and look, and you will find that no prophet is to rise out of Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.53'>Then each went to his own house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.8'>
        <verse osisID='John.8.1'>But Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.2'>Early in the morning he came again to the temple; all the people came to him, and he sat down and taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.3'>Then the scribes and the Pharisees brought to him a woman caught in adultery. And when they had set her in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.4'>they said to him, »Teacher, this woman was caught in the act of adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.5'>Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such. What do you say?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.6'>They said this to test him, that they might have something of which to accuse him. But Jesus bent down and wrote on the ground with his finger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.7'>And when they continued to ask him, he stood up and said to them, »Let him who is without sin among you be the first to throw a stone at her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.8'>And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.9'>Then those who heard it went away one by one, beginning with the oldest even to the last, and Jesus was left alone, with the woman standing before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.10'>Jesus straightened up and said to her, »Woman, where are they? Has no one condemned you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.11'>She said, »No one, Lord.« And Jesus said, »Neither do I condemn you; go, and sin no more.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.12'>Again Jesus spoke to them, saying, »I am the light of the world. He who follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.13'>The Pharisees then said to him, »You are bearing witness of yourself; your testimony is not true.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.14'>Jesus answered, »Even if I bear witness of myself, my testimony is true, for I know where I came from and where I am going; but you do not know where I come from and where I am going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.15'>You judge according to the flesh; I judge no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.16'>And yet if I do judge, my judgment is true, for I am not alone, but I am with the Father who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.17'>In your own law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.18'>I am One who bears witness of myself, and the Father who sent me bears witness of me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.19'>Then they said to him, »Where is your Father?« Jesus answered, »You know neither me nor my Father; if you knew me, you would know my Father also.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.20'>These words he spoke in the treasury, as he taught in the temple; but no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.21'>Then Jesus said to them again, »I am going away, and you will seek me, and will die in your sin. Where I go you cannot come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.22'>Then the Jews said, »Will he kill himself, since he says, Where I go you cannot come?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.23'>He said to them, »You are from below; I am from above. You are of this world; I am not of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.24'>Therefore I told to you that you would die in your sins; for if you do not believe that I am he, you will die in your sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.25'>They said to him, »Who are you?« Jesus said to them, »Just what I have been saying to you from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.26'>I have much to say about you and much to judge; but he who sent me is true, and I declare to the world what I have heard from him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.27'>They did not understand that he spoke to them of the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.28'>So Jesus said, »When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you will know that I am he, and that I do nothing on my own authority but speak just what the Father taught me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.29'>And he who sent me is with me; he has not left me alone, for I always do what is pleasing to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.30'>As he spoke these words, many believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.31'>Jesus then said to the Jews who had believed in him, »If you continue in my word, you are truly my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.32'>And you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.33'>They answered him, »We are Abraham's descendants, and have never been in bondage to anyone. How can you say, You will be made free?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.34'>Jesus answered them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.35'>And a slave does not continue in the house forever, but a son continues forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.36'>So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.37'>I know that you are Abraham's descendants, yet you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.38'>I speak of what I have seen with my Father, and you do what you have heard from your Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.39'>They answered him, »Abraham is our father.« Jesus said to them, »If you were Abraham's children, you would do the things Abraham did,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.40'>but now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth which I heard from God. This is not what Abraham did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.41'>You do the deeds of your father.« They said to him, »We were not born of fornication; we have one Father  God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.42'>Jesus said to them, »If God were your Father, you would love me, for I proceeded and came forth from God; I have not come of my own accord, but he sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.43'>Why do you not understand what I say? It is because you are not able to hear my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.44'>You are of your father the devil, and you want to do your father's desires. He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, he speaks according to his own nature, for he is a liar and the father of lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.45'>But because I tell the truth, you do not believe me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.46'>Which of you convicts me of sin? If I tell the truth, why do you not believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.47'>He who is of God hears the words of God; the reason you do not hear them is that you are not of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.48'>The Jews answered him, »Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.49'>Jesus answered, »I do not have a demon; but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.50'>Yet I do not seek my own glory; there is One who seeks it and he will be the judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.51'>Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word he will never see death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.52'>The Jews said to him, »Now we know that you have a demon! Abraham died, as did the prophets; and you say, If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.53'>Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you claim to be?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.54'>Jesus answered, »If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say that he is your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.55'>But you have not known him; I know him. If I said, I do not know him, I would be a liar like you; but I do know him and keep his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.56'>Your father Abraham rejoiced to see my day; he saw it and was glad.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.57'>The Jews then said to him, »You are not yet fifty years old, and have you seen Abraham?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.58'>Jesus said to them, »Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.8.59'>So they took up stones to throw at him; but Jesus hid himself, and went out of the temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.9'>
        <verse osisID='John.9.1'>As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.2'>And his disciples asked him, »Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.3'>Jesus answered, »Neither this man sinned nor his parents sinned. But that the works of God might be revealed in him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.4'>we must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day. Night is coming, when no one can work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.5'>As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.6'>As he said this, he spat on the ground and made clay of the saliva, and anointed the man's eyes with the clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.7'>And he said to him, »Go, wash in the pool of Siloam« (which means, Sent). So he went and washed, and came back seeing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.8'>The neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar, said, »Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.9'>Some said, »It is he.« Others said, »No, but he is like him.« He said, »I am the man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.10'>They said to him, »Then how were your eyes opened?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.11'>He answered and said, »A man called Jesus made clay and anointed my eyes and said to me, Go to the pool of Siloam and wash. So I went and washed, and I received sight.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.12'>They said to him, »Where is he?« He said, »I do not know.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.13'>They brought to the Pharisees the man who had formerly been blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.14'>Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay and opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.15'>Then the Pharisees also asked him again how he had received his sight. He said to them, »He put clay on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.16'>Some of the Pharisees said, »This man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath.« But others said, »How can a man who is a sinner do such signs?« And there was a division among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.17'>So they again said to the blind man, »What do you say about him, since he has opened your eyes?« He said, »He is a prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.18'>The Jews did not believe that he had been blind, and had received his sight, until they called the parents of the man who had received his sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.19'>And they asked them, »Is this your son, who you say was born blind? How then does he now see?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.20'>His parents answered, »We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.21'>but how he now sees we do not know, nor do we know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age; he will speak for himself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.22'>His parents said this because they feared the Jews, for the Jews had agreed already that if anyone confessed that he was Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.23'>Therefore his parents said, »He is of age; ask him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.24'>So for the second time they called the man who had been blind, and said to him, »Give God the glory; we know that this man is a sinner.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.25'>He answered, »Whether he is a sinner or not, I do not know. One thing I know, that though I was blind, now I see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.26'>Then they said to him, »What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.27'>He answered them, »I have told you already and you did not listen. Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.28'>Then they reviled him and said, »You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.29'>We know that God spoke to Moses, but as for this fellow, we do not know where he comes from.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.30'>The man answered, »Why, this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from, and yet he opened my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.31'>We know that God does not listen to sinners, but if any one is a worshiper of God and does his will, he listens to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.32'>Never since the world began has it been heard that anyone opened the eyes of a man born blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.33'>If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.34'>They answered him, »You were born in utter sin, and are you teaching us?« And they cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.35'>Jesus heard that they had cast him out, and when he found him, he said, »Do you believe in the Son of Man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.36'>He answered, »Who is he, sir, that I may believe in him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.37'>Jesus said to him, »You have seen him, and it is he who speaks with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.38'>Then he said, »Lord, I believe!« And he worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.39'>Jesus said, »For judgment I have come into this world, that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.40'>Then some of the Pharisees who were with him heard this, and said to him, »Are we blind also?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.9.41'>Jesus said to them, »If you were blind, you would have no guilt; but now that you say, We see, your sin remains.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.13'>He flees because he is a hireling and cares nothing for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.14'>I am the good shepherd; I know my sheep, and my sheep know me</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.15'>just as the Father knows me and I know the Father; and I lay down my life for the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.16'>And I have other sheep that are not of this fold; I must bring them also, and they will heed my voice. So there shall be one flock and one shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.17'>For this reason my Father loves me, because I lay down my life, that I may take it again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.18'>No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord. I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it again. This command I have received from my Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.19'>There was again a division among the Jews because of these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.20'>Many of them said, »He has a demon, and is mad. Why listen to him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.21'>Others said, »These are not the sayings of one who has a demon. Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.22'>Then came the Feast of Dedication at Jerusalem. It was winter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.23'>and Jesus was in the temple, walking in Solomon's Porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.24'>So the Jews gathered round him and said to him, »How long will you keep us in suspense? If you are the Christ, tell us plainly.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.25'>Jesus answered them, »I told you, and you do not believe. The works that I do in my Father's name, they bear witness of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.26'>but you do not believe, because you are not of my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.27'>My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.28'>I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one shall snatch them out of my hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.29'>My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all; and no one is able to snatch them out of my Father's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.30'>I and the Father are one.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.31'>The Jews took up stones again to stone him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.32'>Jesus answered them, »I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of these do you stone me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.33'>The Jews answered him, »For a good work we do not stone you, but for blasphemy, and because you, being a man, make yourself God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, »Is it not written in your law, I said, you are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture cannot be broken),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.36'>do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world, You are blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.37'>If I do not do the works of my father, do not believe me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.38'>but if I do them, even though you do not believe me, believe the works, that you may know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.39'>Again they tried to seize him, but he escaped from their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.40'>He went away again across the Jordan to the place where John was baptizing at first, and there he stayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.41'>And many came to him and they said, »John performed no sign, but all that John said about this man was true.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.42'>And many believed in him there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>It was this Mary who anointed the Lord with fragrant oil and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>So the sisters sent to him, saying, »Lord, he whom you love is sick.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>When Jesus heard it, he said, »This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>So, when he heard that he was sick, he stayed two more days in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this he said to the disciples, »Let us go to Judea again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to him, »Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you, and are you going there again?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, »Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if one walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things he said, and after that he said to them, »Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I go to wake him up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>His disciples said, »Lord, if he sleeps, he will recover.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought that he meant taking rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>So then Jesus told them plainly, »Lazarus is dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>and for your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, »Let us also go, that we may die with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been in the tomb four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to comfort them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>When Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, but Mary sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha said to Jesus, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, »Your brother will rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to him, »I know that he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, »I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and whoever lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to him, »Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said this, she went her way and called Mary her sister, saying, »The Teacher is here and is calling for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>When she heard it, she rose quickly and went to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet come to the village, but was still in the place where Martha had met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews who were with her in the house, and comforting her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going to the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then Mary, when she came where Jesus was and saw him, fell at his feet, saying to him, »Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And he said, »Where have you laid him?« They said to him, »Lord, come and see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Then the Jews said, »See how he loved him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, »Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Then Jesus, deeply moved again, came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, »Take away the stone.« Martha, the sister of the dead man, said to him, »Lord, by this time there is a bad odor, for he has been dead four days.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, »Did I not tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, »Father, I thank you that you have heard me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>I knew that you always hear me, but I said this for the benefit of the people standing by, that they may believe that you sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>When he had said this, he cried with a loud voice, »Lazarus, come out!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>The dead man came out, his hands and feet bound with grave clothes, and his face wrapped with a cloth. Jesus said to them, »Unbind him, and let him go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many of the Jews therefore, who had come to Mary and had seen what Jesus did, believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Then the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, »What are we to do? For this man performs many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, said to them, »You know nothing at all!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation not perish.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>He did not say this on his own, but being high priest that year he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for that nation only, but also that he would gather together into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day on they plotted to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore no longer went about openly among the Jews, but went from there to the country near the wilderness, to a town called Ephraim; and there he stayed with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the Passover of the Jews was at hand, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They were looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, »What do you think? That he will not come to the feast?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given orders that if anyone knew where he was, he should report it, so that they might arrest him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>There they made him a supper; and Martha served, while Lazarus was one of those who sat at the table with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary took a pound of very costly perfume of pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But one of his disciples, Judas Iscariot, who was later to betray him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>»Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief; and as he had the money box, he used to take what was put into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus said, »Let her alone, she has kept this for the day of my burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>The poor you always have with you, but you do not always have me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now a great crowd of the Jews learned that he was there, and they came, not only on account of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>So the chief priests planned to put Lazarus also to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews were going away and believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>The next day a great crowd that had come to the feast heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>They took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, »Hosanna!Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!The King of Israel!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>»Fear not, daughter of Zion;behold, your King is coming,sitting on a donkey's colt.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead bore witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this reason the people went to meet him, because they heard that he had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees then said to one another, »You see that you are accomplishing nothing. Look, The world has gone after him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the Feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>Then they came to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, »Sir, we wish to see Jesus.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip went and told Andrew; and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>Jesus answered them, »The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it produces much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loves his life will lose it, and he who hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If anyone serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there my servant will be also. If anyone serves me, him my Father will honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>»Now is my soul troubled, and what shall I say? Father, save me from this hour? No, for this purpose I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify your name.« Then a voice came from heaven, »I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had thundered. Others said, »An angel has spoken to him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered, »This voice has come for your sake, not for mine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world will be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, when I am lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to myself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>He said this to show by what death he was to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The crowd answered him, »We have heard from the Law that the Christ remains forever; and how can you say, The Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said to them, »A little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest the darkness overtake you; he who walks in the darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the light, believe in the light, that you may become sons of light.« When Jesus had said this, he departed and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spoke: »Lord, who has believed our report?And to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>»He has blinded their eyesand hardened their hearts,lest they should see with their eyes,and understand with their hearts and turn,so that I should heal them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>Isaiah said this because he saw his glory and spoke of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless even among the rulers many believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Then Jesus cried out and said, »He who believes in me, believes not in me but in him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who sees me sees him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come as a light into the world, that whoever believes in me should not remain in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not judge him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejects me and does not receive my words has a judge; the word that I have spoken will condemn him on the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken on my own authority; but the Father who sent me gave me a command, what to say and what to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his command is eternal life. Whatever I say, therefore, I say just as the Father has told me.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that his hour had come to depart from this world to the Father, having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And during supper, when the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>rose from supper, laid aside his garments, took a towel and girded himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>After that, he poured water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet, and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then he came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to him, »Lord, are you going to wash my feet?«</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to him, »You shall never wash my feet.« Jesus answered him, »If I do not wash you, you have no part with me.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, »He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not every one of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For he knew who was to betray him; that was why he said, »You are not all clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>When he had washed their feet, and taken his garments, and returned to his place, he said to them, »Do you know what I have done to you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>The disciples looked at one another, uncertain of whom he spoke.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.22'>And when he had said this, one of the officers standing by struck Jesus with his hand, saying, »Is that the way you answer the high priest?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.23'>Jesus answered him, »If I have spoken wrongly, bear witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you strike me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.24'>Then Annas sent him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.25'>Now Simon Peter stood warming himself. Therefore they said to him, »You are not also one of his disciples, are you?« He denied it and said, »I am not.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.26'>One of the servants of the high priest, a relative of him whose ear Peter had cut off, said, »Did I not see you in the garden with him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.27'>Peter again denied it; and at once a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.28'>Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the Praetorium, and it was early morning. But they did not enter the Praetorium themselves, so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.29'>So Pilate went out to them and said, »What accusation do you bring against this man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.30'>They answered him, »If he were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.31'>Pilate said to them, »Take him yourselves and judge him by your own law.« The Jews said to him, »It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>This happened so that the words Jesus had spoken would be fulfilled, showing by what death he was going to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>Then Pilate entered the Praetorium again, called Jesus, and said to him, »Are you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jesus answered, »Do you say this on your own, or did others say it to you about me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, »Am I a Jew? Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me; what have you done?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, »My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would fight, so that I should not be delivered to the Jews; but now my kingship is not from here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate said to him, »You are a king then?« Jesus answered, »You say what I ama king. For this I was born, and for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Everyone who is of the truth hears my voice.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate said to him, »What is truth?« After he had said this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, »I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover. So do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>Then they all cried again, »Not this man, but Barabbas!« Now Barabbas was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>So then Pilate took Jesus and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers twisted a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they clothed him in a purple robe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>They came up to him, saying, »Hail, King of the Jews!« and struck him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>Pilate went out again, and said to them, »See, I am bringing him out to you, that you may know that I find no crime in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>So Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, »Behold the man!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When the chief priests and officers saw him, they cried out, »Crucify him, crucify him!« Pilate said to them, »You take him and crucify him, for I find no fault in him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, »We have a law, and according to that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate heard these words, he was the more afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and he went again into the Praetorium and said to Jesus, »Where are you from?« But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate said to him, »You will not speak to me? Do you not know that I have power to release you, and power to crucify you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, »You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above. Therefore the one who delivered me to you has the greater sin.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From then on Pilate sought to release him, but the Jews cried out, »If you let this man go, you are not Caesars friend. Anyone who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment seat at a place that is called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the day of Preparation of the Passover, about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, »Behold your King!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, »Away with him! Away with him! Crucify him!« Pilate said to them, »Shall I crucify your King?« The chief priests answered, »We have no King but Caesar.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then he handed him over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And he, bearing his cross, went out to a place called the Place of the Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>There they crucified him, and two others with him, one on either side, and Jesus in the center.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Pilate wrote a title and put it on the cross. It read: JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Many of the Jews read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, Greek, and Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, »Do not write, The King of the Jews, but, This man said, I am King of the Jews.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, »What I have written, I have written.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments, and made four parts, one for each soldier, and also his tunic. Now the tunic was without seam, woven in one piece from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>So they said to one another, »Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be.« This happened that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: »They divided my garments among them,and for my clothing they cast lots.«This is what the soldiers did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>By the cross of Jesus stood his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus saw his mother, and the disciple whom he loved standing by, he said to his mother, »Woman, behold your son!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then he said to the disciple, »Behold, your mother!« And from that hour the disciple took her to his own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, knowing that all was now accomplished, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, said, »I thirst.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now a vessel full of wine vinegar was sitting there; so they filled a sponge with the vinegar, put it on hyssop, and put it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>So when Jesus had received the vinegar, he said, »It is finished!« And he bowed his head and gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Therefore, because it was the day of Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other who had been crucified with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>He who saw it has testified, and his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth, that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled, »Not one of his bones shall be broken.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture says, »They shall look on him whom they have pierced.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After this Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus, and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus, who had at first come to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in strips of linen with the spices, as is the burial custom of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had ever been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>So because of the Jewish day of Preparation, as the tomb was nearby, they laid Jesus there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>So she ran, and came to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, »They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went out with the other disciple, and they were going toward the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>They both ran, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and went into the tomb; and he saw the linen cloths lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the napkin that had been around his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in; and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went back to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And she saw two angels in white, sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and the other at the feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>They said to her, »Woman, why are you weeping?« She said to them, »Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>Saying this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, but she did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, »Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?« Supposing him to be the gardener, she said to him, »Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, »Mary!« She turned and said to him in Hebrew, »Rabboni!« (which means, Teacher).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, »Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, »I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, »I have seen the Lord!« And she told them that he had said these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, »Peace be with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>When he had said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus said to them again, »Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I also send you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and said to them, »Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>So the other disciples told him, »We have seen the Lord.« But he said to them, »Unless I see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my finger in the mark of the nails, and put my hand in his side, I will not believe.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, »Peace be with you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then he said to Thomas, »Put your finger here, and see my hands. Reach out your hand, and put it into my side; do not be unbelieving, but believing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered him, »My Lord and my God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus said to him, »Have you believed because you have seen me? Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After this Jesus showed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberias, and in this way he showed himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others of his disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, »I am going fishing.« They said to him, »We will go with you.« They went out and got into the boat; but that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But early in the morning, Jesus stood on the shore; yet the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus said to them, »Children, have you any fish?« They answered him, »No.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He said to them, »Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some.« So they cast, and now they were not able to haul it in because of the great number of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Then that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, »It is the Lord!« Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish, for they were not far from land, but about a hundred yards off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>When they had come to land, they saw a fire of coals there, with fish lying on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, »Bring some of the fish you have just caught.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, »Come and have breakfast.« Now none of the disciples dared ask him, »Who are you?« They knew it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This was now the third time Jesus appeared to his disciples after he was raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>When they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, »Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?« He said to him, »Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.« He said to him, »Feed my lambs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him again a second time, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« He said to him, »Yes, Lord; you know that I love you.« He said to him, »Tend my sheep.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time, »Simon, son of John, do you love me?« Peter was grieved because he said to him the third time, »Do you love me?« And he said to him, »Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.« Jesus said to him, »Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were younger, you girded yourself and walked where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>This he said to show by what death he would glorify God. And after this he said to him, »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter turned and saw following them the disciple whom Jesus loved, who had leaned on his breast at the supper and had said, »Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, »Lord, what about this man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you? You follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Then the saying spread among the brethren that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, »If I want him to remain until I come, what is that to you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who testifies to these things, and who wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>But there are also many other things which Jesus did. If every one of them were to be written, I suppose that even the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.</verse>
