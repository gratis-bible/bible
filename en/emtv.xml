        <description>Welcome to the third edition of  The English Majority Text Version (EMTV) of the Holy Bible. This latest edition has Greek explanatory notes throughout the Bible, to aid the reader in understanding the meanings in some select places of the original Koine Greek. Also, the third edition finds itself closer to the Robinson/Pierpoint printed edition of the Byzantine majority text, rather than the Hodges/Farstad text, which the EMTV was translated from. You will notice these differences in John 7:53-8:11, as well as the entire book of Revelation. The English Majority Text Version draws from the work of both Dr.’s Hodges and Farstad, and their text, “The Greek New Testament According to the Majority Text,” as well as from Dr. Wilbur Pickering, ThM. PhD., and the EMTV has incorporated his hard work in the field of producing evidence of just what does constitute a majority reading, and, as a result of his work, and the work of others, John 7:53-8:11, and the book of Revelation reflect these variant readings. This is one of the great things about having a Bible that is translated from the majority of the trustworthy Byzantine manuscripts that are in existence—the much greater probability of accuracy. On the other side of the fence, most modern Bibles are translated from a few scant manuscripts (literally), and more often than not they do not even agree with each other. Not so with a Bible that is translated out of the majority! The experts in linguistics who have put these readings together, and diligently compared the manuscripts, had hundreds and hundreds of manuscripts to compare. It is my prayer that this work will bring honor to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, and to our God and Father; because all of this, all that we do, we do to know Him better, and to better understand His word, which He has given to mankind. “Every word of God is pure; He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to His words, Lest He rebuke you, and you be found a liar. (Prove 30:5,6). Peace of Christ to you all.  In His service, Paul W Esposito Stauros Ministries</description>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, and Hezron fathered Ram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Ram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse fathered David the king. David the king fathered Solomon by her who had been the wife of Uriah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asa fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Uzziah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amon, and Amon fathered Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah fathered Jeconiah and his brothers at the time of the captivity in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>And after the captivity in Babylon, Jeconiah fathered Shealtiel, and Shealtiel fathered Zerubbabel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>And Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus who is called Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham till David [were] fourteen generations, from David until the captivity in Babylon [were] fourteen generations, and from the captivity in Babylon until the Christ [were] fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After His mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found pregnant by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Then Joseph her husband, being righteous and not wanting to make her a public example, purposed to put her away secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>But while he was thinking about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take unto [you] Mary your wife, for that which is begotten in her is of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>And she shall bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS, for He shall save His people from their sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this came to pass that the thing spoken by the Lord through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>"Behold, the virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a Son, and they shall call His name Immanuel,"which is translated, "God with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>Then Joseph, having been aroused from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had ordered him and took to [him] his wife,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>but did not know her till she brought forth her firstborn Son. And he called His name JESUS.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the East arrived in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>saying, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews? For we have seen His star in the East, and have come to worship Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>But when Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>And having gathered together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them where the Christ would be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>So they said to him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it is written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>'But you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for out of you shall come forth a Ruler who will shepherd My people Israel.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod, secretly having called the wise men, ascertained from them the time that the star appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, "Go and carefully search for the young Child, and as soon as you find [Him], report back to me, so that I also may come and worship Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>When they heard the king, they departed; and behold, the star which they had seen in the East went before them, till it came and stood over where the young Child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>And when they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>And having come into the house, they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and falling down, they worshipped Him, and opening their treasures, they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And having been divinely instructed in a dream not to return to Herod, they withdrew into their own country by another way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying, "Arise, and take along the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt, and stay there until I tell you; for Herod is about to seek the young Child to destroy Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>When he arose, he took along the young Child and His mother by night and withdrew into Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and was there until the death of Herod, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying, "Out of Egypt I called My Son."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod, seeing that he had been deceived by the wise men, was greatly enraged; and he sent and executed all the boys in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had ascertained from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>"A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation and weeping, and great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, refusing to be comforted, because they are no more."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>Now after Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>saying, "Arise, and take with [you] the young Child and His mother, and go into the land of Israel, for those who were seeking the life of the young Child have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>Then he rose and took along the young Child and His mother, and came into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being divinely instructed in a dream, he withdrew into the regions of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And when he arrived, he settled down in a city called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, "He would be called a Nazarene."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days John the Baptist arrived preaching in the wilderness of Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah, saying: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the LORD; make His paths straight.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>And John himself had his clothing [made] from camel's hair, with a leather belt around his waist; and his food was locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the region around the Jordan were going out to him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and they were being baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and do not think to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>But even now, the ax is laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with [the] Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and He will gather His wheat into the barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus arrived from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John [tried to ]prevent Him, saying, "I have need to be baptized by You, and You are coming to me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered and said to him, "Permit it now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness."Then he permitted Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And having been baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water; and behold, the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And behold, a voice came out of the heavens, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I have found delight."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led up into the wilderness by the Spirit, to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And approaching Him, the tempter said, "If You are the Son of God, speak so that these stones may become bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But He answered and said, "It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took Him up into the holy city, and set Him on the pinnacle of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and said to Him, "If You are the Son of God, throw Yourself down. For it is written: 'He shall give His angels orders concerning you,' and, 'In their hands they will lift you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him, "Again, it is written, 'You shall not tempt the LORD your God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again, the devil took Him up on a very high mountain, and showed Him all the kingdoms of the world, and their glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>And he said to Him, "All these things will I give You, if You will fall down and worship me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him, "Get behind Me, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the LORD your God, and Him alone you shall serve.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left Him, and behold, angels came and ministered to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus heard that John had been imprisoned, He departed into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And leaving Nazareth behind, He came and settled down in Capernaum, which is by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>"The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, by the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>the people sitting in darkness have seen a great light, and to those who sat in the land and the shadow of death, light sprang up on them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Now as He was walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, He saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>Then He said to them, "Come after Me, and I will make you fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>They immediately left their nets and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And having gone forth from there, He saw two other brothers, James the [son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>And immediately they left the boat and their father, and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And Jesus went about all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And the report of Him went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all those who were ill, and [who were ]suffering with various diseases and torments, and those who were demon-possessed, epileptics, and paralytics; and He healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And large crowds followed Him from Galilee and from Decapolis, and Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>And seeing the crowds, He went up into the mountain, and after He had sat down, His disciples approached Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>And opening His mouth, He began to teach them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>"Blessed [are] the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed [are] those who mourn, for they will be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed [are] the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed [are] those who hunger and thirst after righteousness, for they shall be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed [are] the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed [are] the pure in heart, for they shall see God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed [are] the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed [are] those who have been persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>"Blessed are you whenever they revile you, and they persecute you, and they say all kinds of evil against you falsely for My sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be exceedingly glad, for great is your reward in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>"You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt becomes tasteless, with what shall it be salted? It is then good for nothing but to be thrown out and to be trampled underfoot by men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Nor do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand, and it shines on everything in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Thus let your light shine before men, so that they may see your good works, and they may glorify your Father who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>"Do not think that I came to abolish the Law or the Prophets. I did not come to abolish, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For assuredly I say to you, until heaven and earth may pass away, one iota or one tittle shall by no means pass away from the law until all things are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever therefore shall break one of the least of these commandments, and shall teach men thus, will be called least in the kingdom of heaven; but whoever does [them] and teaches [them], he shall be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I say to you, that unless your righteousness exceeds the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>"You have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not kill,' and whoever kills will be liable to the judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you that whoever gets angry with his brother without cause will be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, 'Empty-head!' will be liable to the council. But whoever says, ' fool!' will be liable to the fiery hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>Therefore if you offer your gift on the altar, and there you remember that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar, and go, first be reconciled with your brother, and then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Make friends with your adversary quickly, while you are on the road with him, lest your adversary hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Assuredly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there till you have paid the last penny.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, that whoever looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery [with] her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>If your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members be lost, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is better for you that one of your members be lost, than for your whole body to be cast into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>"Furthermore it has been said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a divorce certificate.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>"But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for a matter of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery; and whoever marries a divorcee commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>"Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients, 'You shall not swear falsely, but you shall pay your oaths to the Lord.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>"But I say to you, do not swear at all: neither by heaven, for it is God's throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for it is His footstool; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Nor shall you swear by your head, because you are not able to make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>But let your word be 'Yes', 'yes,'; [or ]'No,' 'no.' For whatever is more than these is from the evil [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>"You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I say to you not to resist an evil person. But whoever shall slap you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>And to the [one] desiring to sue you and to take your tunic, let him have your cloak also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to the [one] asking you, and to the [one] desiring to borrow from you, do not turn away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>"You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor, and you shall hate your enemy.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>"Take care not to be doing your charitable giving before men, so as to be seen by them. Otherwise, you have not a reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>Whenever therefore you do charitable giving, do not sound a trumpet before you as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, so that they may be praised by men. Assuredly I say to you, they receive their reward in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you do charitable giving, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.4'>so that your charitable giving may be in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will Himself reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.5'>"And whenever you pray, you shall not be like the hypocrites, because they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and on the streetcorners, so that they may be seen by men. Assuredly I say to you, that they receive their reward in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.6'>But you, whenever you pray, enter into your room, and when you have shut your door, pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father, who sees in secret, will reward you openly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.7'>But when you pray, do not babble like the heathen, for they think that they will be heard for their many words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.8'>Therefore do not be like them. For your Father knows what things[ ]you have need of before you ask Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.9'>Therefore pray in this manner: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be Your name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.10'>Your kingdom come, Your will be done, on earth as [it is ]in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.11'>Give us this day our daily bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.12'>And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.13'>And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from the evil [one]. For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.14'>"For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.15'>But if you do not forgive men their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.16'>"Moreover, when you fast, do not become gloomy, like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that they may appear to men [to be] fasting. Assuredly I say to you, that they receive their reward in full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.17'>But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.6.24'>"No one is able to serve two masters; for either he will hate the one, and he will love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one, and he will despise the other. You cannot serve God and money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.25'>"Because of this I say to you, do not worry [about ]your life-what you shall eat, or what you shall drink-nor [about] your body, what you shall put on. Is not life more than food and the body [more than] clothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.26'>Look at the birds of the air, for they neither sow nor reap, nor do they gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not worth more than they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.27'>Which of you by worrying is able to add one cubit to his stature?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.28'>So why do you worry about clothes? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow; they neither labor, nor spin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.29'>and yet I say to you, that not even Solomon in all his glory was arrayed like one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.30'>But if God thus clothes the grass of the field, which exists today, and tomorrow is cast into the oven, [will He] not much more [clothe] you, [O you] of little faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.31'>Therefore do not worry, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we put on?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.32'>"For after all these things the Gentiles seek. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.33'>But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.34'>Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about its own affairs. Each day has enough trouble of its own.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.1'>When He had come down from the mountain, great crowds followed Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>And reaching out His hand, Jesus touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed."Immediately his leprosy was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>And Jesus said to him, "See that you tell no one; but go, show yourself to the priest, and offer the gift which Moses commanded, as a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>Now when He had entered Capernaum, a centurion approached Him, begging Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>and saying, "Lord, my servant has been laid up in the house a paralytic, being tormented terribly."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>And Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion answered and said, "Lord, I am not worthy that You should come under my roof. But just say the word and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I also am a man under authority, having soldiers under me. And I say to this [one], 'Go,' and he goes; and to another, 'Come,' and he comes; and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jesus heard it, He marveled, and said to those who were following, "Assuredly, I say to you, I have not found such great faith, not even in Israel!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>And I say to you that many shall come from east and west, and recline [to eat] with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Then Jesus said to the centurion, "Go; and as you believed, may it be unto you."And his servant was healed that same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>Now when Jesus had come into Peter's house, He saw his wife's mother having been laid up, and burning with fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>And He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up, and began to serve Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>When evening had come, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed. And He cast out the spirits with a word, and He healed all that were ill,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>so that it might be fulfilled which was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying: "He Himself took our infirmities, and bore our diseases."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>And when Jesus saw great crowds around Him, He gave orders to depart to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>Then a certain scribe approached, and said to Him, "Teacher, I will follow You wherever You go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have dens, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>Then another of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>Now when He got into a boat, His disciples followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>And behold, a great tempest arose on the sea, so that the boat was covered by waves; but He was sleeping.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>But He said to them, "Why are you fearful, O [you] of little faith?"Then having risen, He rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>So the men marveled, saying, "What kind [of Man] is this, that even the winds and the sea obey Him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>And when He came to the other side, to the region of the Gergesenes, [there] met Him two demon-possessed [men], coming out of the tombs; exceedingly violent, so that no one was able to pass by that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>And suddenly they cried out, saying, "What have we to do with You, Jesus, Son of God? Have You come here to torment us before the time?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now there was far off from them a herd of many swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>So the demons implored Him, saying, "If You cast us out, permit us to go off into the herd of swine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>And He said to them, "Go."So they came out, and went off into the herd of swine. And behold, the whole herd of swine rushed violently down the steep bank into the sea, and died in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>Then those who tended them fled; and going off into the city, they reported everything, including what had happened to the demon-possessed [men].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And seeing Him, they implored Him that He might go away from their region.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>And getting into the boat, He crossed over and went into His own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>And behold, they were carrying a paralytic to Him lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Have courage, child; your sins are forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>And at once some of the scribes said among themselves, "This Man blasphemes!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jesus, perceiving their thoughts, said, "Why do you think evil in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins"-then He said to the paralytic, "Arise, take up your bed, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>And having arisen, he went off to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>Now when the crowds saw, they marveled and glorified God, who had given such authority to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>And as Jesus passed on from there, He saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax office. And He said to him, "Follow Me."And arising, he followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>Now it came to pass, as He reclined [to eat] in the house, that behold, many tax collectors and sinners, having come, were reclining [to eat] with Jesus and His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to His disciples, "Why does your Teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>When Jesus heard that, He said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>But go and learn what this means: 'I desire mercy and not sacrifice.' For I did not come to call [the ]righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then the disciples of John approached Him, saying, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but Your disciples do not fast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>And Jesus said to them, "Can the groomsmen mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? But the days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>No one puts on a patch of a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; for it takes away its completeness from the garment, and the tear is made worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Nor do they put new wine into old wineskins, or else the wineskins burst, and the wine spills out, and the wineskins will be ruined. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>As He spoke these things to them, behold, a certain leader came and worshipped Him, saying, "My daughter has just died, but come and lay Your hand on her, and she shall live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>So Jesus arose and followed him, likewise His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>And behold, a woman hemorrhaging for twelve years, approaching from behind, touched the hem of His garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>For she said to herself, "If only I may touch His garment, I will be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>But Jesus, turning around and seeing her, said, "Take courage, daughter; your faith has healed you."And the woman was healed from that hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>And when Jesus came into the house of the leader, and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>He said to them, "Make room, for the girl has not died, but she is sleeping."And they were ridiculing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>But when the crowd had been put out, He went in and grasped her hand, and the little girl arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>And the report of this went out into that whole land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>And as Jesus passed by from there, two blind [men] followed Him, crying out and saying, "Son of David, have pity on us!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>And when He came into the house, the blind [men] approached Him, and Jesus said to them, "Do you believe that I am able to do this?"They said to Him, "Yes, Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then He touched their eyes, saying, "According to your faith, let it be unto you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, saying, "See [that you] let no one know."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they, having gone out, spread the news about Him in that whole land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>And as they were going out, behold, they brought to Him a mute man, being demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>And when the demon was cast out, the mute spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, "It was never seen like this in Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees said, "By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>And Jesus was going about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every illness and every disease among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>But seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and prostrated, like sheep having no shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then He said to His disciples, "Indeed the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>Though desiring to kill him, he feared the crowd, because they counted him as a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>Now when Herod's birthday was being celebrated, the daughter of Herodias danced before them, and she pleased Herod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>Therefore he promised with an oath to give her whatever she should ask.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then those who were in the boat came and worshipped Him, saying, "Truly You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For God commanded, saying, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'He who curses father or mother, with death let him die.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.12'>Then His disciples approached and said to Him, "You know that when the Pharisees heard this message they were offended?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>But He answered and said, "It is not good to take the children's bread and to throw [it] to the little dogs."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.28'>But when that servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. And taking hold of him, he was choking him, saying, 'Pay me what you owe!'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.31'>So when his fellow servants saw what had been done, they were very grieved, and they came and narrated to their master all that had taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.32'>Then summoning him, his master said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.33'>Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant, as I also had compassion on you?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.34'>"And being angered, his master handed him over to the tormentors until he should pay all that was owed to him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.26'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.1'>Now it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these words, that He said to His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.2'>You know that after two days the Passover takes place, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.3'>Then the chief priests, the scribes, and the elders of the people were assembled into the court of the high priest, who was called Caiaphas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.4'>and plotted to take Jesus by guile and kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.5'>But they said, "Not during the feast, lest a disturbance take place among the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.6'>And when Jesus was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.7'>a woman came to Him having an alabaster [flask] of very expensive perfume, and she began to pour it on His head as He reclined to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.8'>But when His disciples saw it, they became indignant, saying, "Why this waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.9'>For this perfume could have been sold for much, and have been given to the poor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.10'>But when Jesus became aware of it, He said to them, "Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful work for Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.11'>For you have the poor with you always, but Me you do not have always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.12'>For this [woman], having put this perfume on My body, she did [it] for My burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.13'>Assuredly I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what this [woman] did will be spoken as a memorial to her."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.14'>Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.15'>and said, "What are you willing to give me if I deliver Him to you?"And they weighed out for him thirty silver [coins].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.16'>And from then [on] he sought an opportunity to betray Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.17'>Now on the first day of the Feast of the Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, "Where do You desire [that] we shall prepare for You to eat the Passover?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>And He said, "Go into the city to a certain man, and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near; at your house I will keep the Passover with My disciples."' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them; and they prepared the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>And when it was evening, He was reclining [to eat] with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>Now while they were eating, He said, "Assuredly I say to you, that one of you will betray Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>And becoming exceedingly sorrowful, each of them began to say to Him, "[Surely] not I am [the one], Lord?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>He answered and said, "He who dipped his hand with Me in the bowl will betray Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>Indeed, the Son of Man goes just as it is written about Him, but woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been good for that man if he had not been born."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Then Judas, the [one] betraying Him, answered and said, "[Surely ]not I am [the one], Rabbi?"He said to him, "You have said [it]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>And as they were eating, Jesus took the bread, and giving thanks, He broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples and said, "Take, eat; this is My body."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>Then He took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to them, saying, "Drink of it, all [of you],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>for this is My blood of the new covenant, which is shed for many, for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>But I say to you, that I will by no means drink of this fruit of the vine from now [on,] until that day when I drink it new with you in My Father's kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>And having sung hymns, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will be made to stumble because of Me on this night, for it is written: 'I will strike the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>"But after I have been raised, I will go before you to Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>Peter answered and said to Him, "Even if all are made to stumble because of You, yet I will never be made to stumble."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I say to you that on this night, before [the] rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter said to Him, "Even if I have to die with You, by no means will I deny You!"And likewise said all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus came with them to a place called Gethsemane, and said to the disciples, "Sit here while I go off and pray [over] there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>And taking along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, He began to be sorrowful and deeply distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then Jesus said to them, "My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>He went a little farther and fell on His face, and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as You [will]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>Then He came to the disciples and found them sleeping, and said to Peter, "What? Were you not strong [enough] to watch with Me one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>Watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. Indeed the spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>Again, a second time, He went away and prayed, saying, "O My Father, if this cup cannot pass away from Me unless I drink it, let Your will be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>And He came and found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>And leaving them, He went away again, and prayed a third time, saying the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then He came to His disciples and said to them, "Sleep now, and rest. Behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Rise up, let us be going. See, he who betrays Me is at hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>And while He was still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the twelve came, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, [sent] from the chief priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the [one] betraying Him had given them a sign, saying, "Whomever I shall kiss, He is [the One]; seize Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>And immediately he went up to Jesus and said, "Greetings, Rabbi!"and kissed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>But Jesus said to him, "Friend, why have you come?"Then they came and laid hands on Jesus and seized Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>And behold, one of those with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword, and striking the servant of the high priest, he cut off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>But Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back into its place, for all those who take the sword shall perish by the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Or do you think that I cannot now call upon My Father, and He will furnish Me with more than twelve legions of angels?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How then would the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must happen thus?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>In that hour Jesus said to the crowds, "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to arrest Me? I sat daily with you, teaching in the temple, and you did not seize Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all this has happened so that the Scriptures of the prophets may be fulfilled."Then all the disciples forsook Him and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>And those having seized Jesus led [Him] away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>But Peter was following Him from a distance, up to the courtyard of the high priest. And entering inside, he sat down with the attendants to see the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Now the chief priests, the elders, and all the Sanhedrin were seeking false witnesses against Jesus, so that they might put Him to death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>and they did not find [any]. And though many false witnesses came forward, they did not find [any]. But at last two false witnesses came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and said, "This [Man] said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and after three days to rebuild it.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>And standing up the high priest said to Him, "Do You answer nothing? What is it these men are testifying against You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus kept silent. And the high priest answered and said to Him, "I adjure You by the living God: Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him, "You said [it]. Nevertheless, I say to you, from now [on,] you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming on the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his clothes, saying, "He has blasphemed! What further need do we have of witnesses? Look, now you have heard His blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What do you think?"They answered and said, "He is deserving of death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spat in His face, and beat Him with [their] fists; and they slapped [Him,]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, "Prophesy to us, Christ! Who is he that struck You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter sat outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came to him, saying, "You also were with Jesus of Galilee."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it before them all, saying, "I do not know what you are saying."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>And when he had gone out to the gateway, another [girl] saw him and said to them there, "This [man] was with Jesus the Nazarene."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>But again he denied with an oath, "I do not know the Man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>And after a little [while], those standing by came up and said to Peter, "Surely you also are one of them, for your accent gives you away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to curse and swear, saying, "I do not know the Man!"And immediately a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>And Peter remembered the word of Jesus which He said to him, "Before the rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."And going out, he wept bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When morning came, all the chief priests and elders of the people plotted against Jesus, so as to put Him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>And having bound Him, they led Him away and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, the [one] betraying Him, seeing that He was condemned, feeling regret, returned the thirty silver [coins] to the chief priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."And they said, "What is [that] to us? You see to it!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>And throwing the silver [coins] in the sanctuary, he departed; and going away, he hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>But the chief priests, taking the silver [coins] said, "It is not lawful to put them into the temple treasury, since they are the price of blood."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>And taking counsel, they bought with them the potter's field, to bury strangers in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then was fulfilled the thing spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying, "And they took the thirty [coins], the value of Him who was priced, whom they of the sons of Israel priced,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>"and they gave them for the potter's field, as the LORD directed me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Now Jesus stood before the governor. And the governor asked Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?"So Jesus said to him, "It is as you say."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>And while He was being accused by the chief priests and elders, He answered nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to Him, "Do You not hear how many things they testify against You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>And He answered him not one word, so that the governor was greatly amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>Now at the feast, the governor was accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they wished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>Therefore when they had assembled, Pilate said to them, "Whom do you wish [that] I should release to you, Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that they had handed Him over because of envy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>Now as he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, "Have nothing to do with that just Man, for I have suffered many things today in a dream because of Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the chief priests and elders persuaded the crowds that they should ask for Barabbas, but they should destroy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>The governor answered and said to them, "Which of the two do you wish me to release to you?"They said, "Barabbas!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, "What then shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ?"They all said to him, "Let Him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>Then the governor said, "Why, what evil did He do?"But they cried out all the more, saying, "Let Him be crucified!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>And Pilate, seeing that nothing was being gained, but rather a riot was starting, taking water, he washed his hands clean in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of the blood of this just [Man]. You see to it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>And all the people answered and said, "His blood [be] on us and on our children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas to them; and having scourged Jesus, he delivered Him to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus to the Praetorium, gathered the whole garrison around Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>And having stripped Him, they put a scarlet robe on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>When they had twisted a crown of thorns, they put it on His head, and a reed in His right hand. And kneeling before Him, they mocked Him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>And spitting on Him, they took the reed and were striking [Him] on His head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the robe, and dressed Him in His own clothes, and led Him away in order to crucify [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>And going out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. Him they pressed into service that he might carry His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>And coming to a place called Golgotha, that is to say, Place of a Skull,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they gave Him sour wine mingled with gall to drink. But having tasted it, He would not drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>And having crucified Him, they divided His clothes among themselves,[ ]casting lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>And sitting down, they guarded Him there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>And they put up over His head the crime having been written [against] Him: THIS IS JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>Then they crucified two thieves with Him, one on His right, and another on His left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, "You[ ]who destroy the temple and build it in three days, save Yourself! If You are the Son of God, come down from the cross."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking [Him ]with the scribes and elders, and Pharisees, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>He saved others; Himself He cannot save. If He is the King of Israel, let Him now come down from the cross, and we will believe on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusted in God; let Him deliver Him now if He'll [have] Him; for He said, 'I am the Son of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>Even the thieves who were crucified with Him were reviling Him with the same [insult].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from the sixth hour until the ninth hour, darkness came upon all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani?"that is, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>Some of those standing [by], when they heard this, said, "This [Man] is calling Elijah!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, and filled it with sour wine and put it around a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the rest said, "Leave [Him] alone; let us see if Elijah is coming to save Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>But Jesus, again crying out with a loud voice, released His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>And behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>and the tombs were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had passed away were raised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>and coming forth out of the tombs after His resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>So when the centurion and those with him guarding Jesus, when they saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they were greatly afraid, saying, "Truly this was the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>And there were many women there observing from a distance, who followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to Him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>Now when evening had come, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who himself had also become a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>This [man] went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded the body to be given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>And taking the body, Joseph wrapped it up in a clean linen cloth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>and placed it in his new tomb which he had cut in the rock; and having rolled a large stone [against] the door of the tomb, he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>And Mary Magdalene was there, and the other Mary, sitting opposite the grave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>On the next day, which is after the Preparation [Day], the chief priests and Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>saying, "Sir, we remember that that deceiver said while He was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>"Therefore command that the grave be made secure until the third day, lest His disciples come by night and steal Him, and say to the people, 'He was raised from the dead.' So the last deception will be worse [than] the first."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate said to them, "You have a guard; go make it as secure as you know [how]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and secured the grave, sealing the stone, with the guard.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>And going out quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to report to His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>And as they were going to report to His disciples, that behold, Jesus met them, saying, "Rejoice!"So they came and held His feet and worshipped Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them, "Do not be afraid. Go, report to My brothers that they should go to Galilee, and there they will see Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>Now while they were going, behold, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests everything that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>When they had assembled with the elders and taking counsel, they gave sufficient silver [coins] to the soldiers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>saying, "Tell them, 'His disciples came at night and stole Him away while we were sleeping.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>"And if this reaches the governor's ears, we will influence him and make you secure."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So they took the silver and did as they were instructed. And this saying has been widely spread among the Jews until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>Then the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw Him, they worshipped Him; but some doubted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Go [therefore] and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to observe everything that I have commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>. THE BEGINNING OF THE GOSPEL OF JESUS CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in the Prophets: "Behold, I send My messenger before Your face, who will prepare Your way before You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>"A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make His paths straight.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John came baptizing in the wilderness and preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the Judean country and the inhabitants of Jerusalem went out to him and were all baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Now John was clothed with camel's hair and with a leather belt around his waist, and was eating locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he was preaching, saying, "There comes One after me who is stronger than me, of whom I am not worthy to stoop down and to loose the strap of His[ ]sandal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I baptized you in water, but He will baptize you in the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>It came to pass in those days that Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized by John in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately, coming up from the water, He saw the heavens parting and the Spirit coming down upon Him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>Then a voice came from the heavens, "You are My beloved Son, in whom I have found delight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit drove Him into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And He was there in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan, and was with the wild animals; and the angels were ministering to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>Now after John was imprisoned, Jesus came to Galilee, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying, "The time has been fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand. Repent, and believe in the gospel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And as He was walking alongside the Sea of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Then Jesus said to them, "Come after Me, and I will make you become fishers of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately leaving their nets they followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And having gone forth from there a little, He saw James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in the boat mending their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And immediately He called them. And after they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired workers, they went away after Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they were going into Capernaum. And immediately on the Sabbath, He entered the synagogue and began teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were astonished at His doctrine, for He was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>Now there was a man in their synagogue with an unclean spirit, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying, "Let us alone! What have we to do with You, Jesus of Nazareth? Have You come to destroy us? I know who You are-the Holy One of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silent, and come out of him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And when the unclean spirit threw him into a convulsion, and crying out with a loud voice, came out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>Then they were all amazed, so that they were disputing among themselves, saying, "What is this? What new doctrine is this, that He commands even the unclean spirits with authority, and they obey Him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And immediately the report of Him went out into the whole surrounding region of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And immediately when they went out from the synagogue, they came to the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>And the mother-in-law of Simon was lying sick with a fever, and immediately they spoke to Him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>So He came and He raised her up, grasping her hand; and immediately the fever left her. And she began to serve them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Now when evening came, when the sun set, they were bringing to Him all those who were ill, and those who were demon-possessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole city was gathered together at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And He healed many who were ill with various diseases, and He cast out many demons; and He did not allow the demons to speak, because they knew who He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And in the very early morning before dawn, He arose and He went out, and went away to a deserted place; and there He was praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Simon and those who were with Him sought Him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>When they found Him, they said to Him, "Everyone is looking for You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>But He said to them, "Let us go to the neighboring towns, that I may preach there also, because for this reason I have come forth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And He was preaching in their synagogues throughout all Galilee, and casting out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>Then a leper came to Him, beseeching Him, kneeling before Him and saying to Him, "If You are willing, You are able to cleanse me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jesus, being moved with compassion, [and] reaching out His hand, touched him, and said to him, "I am willing, be cleansed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And when He said this, immediately the leprosy left from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And [after] sternly warning him, immediately He sent him away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and said to him, "See that you say nothing to anyone; but go, show yourself to the priest, and bring as an offering concerning your cleansing those things which Moses prescribed, as a testimony to them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he went out and began to proclaim it freely, and to spread widely the report, so that He was no longer able to enter into a city, but was outside in deserted places; and they were coming to Him from everywhere.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And He entered again into Capernaum after [some] days, and it was heard that He was in a certain house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And immediately many were gathered together, so that there was no longer any room, not even near the door. And He was speaking the word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came to Him, bringing a paralytic being carried by four [men].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And not being able to get near Him because of the crowd, they removed the tiles from the roof where He was, and having dug through they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>And Jesus, seeing their faith, He said to the paralytic, "Child, your sins have been forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who is able to forgive sins except God alone?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately, when Jesus recognized in His spirit that they were reasoning thus among themselves, He said to them, "Why are you reasoning these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins have been forgiven,' or to say, 'Arise, take up your bed and walk'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But in order that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins"-He said to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>"I say to you, arise, and take up your bed, and go to your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And immediately he arose, and taking his bed, he went out before [them] all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, "We never saw [anything] like this!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Then He went out again alongside the sea; and all the crowd was coming to Him, and He was teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And passing by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, "Follow Me."And arising, he followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>Now it came about, as He was dining in Levi's house, that many tax collectors and sinners were dining together with Jesus and His disciples; for there were many, and they followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes and Pharisees, seeing Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to His disciples, "Why does He eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>When Jesus heard it, He said to them, "Those who are healthy have no need of a physician, but those who are ill. I did not come to call [the ]righteous, but sinners, to repentance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And the disciples of John and of the Pharisees were fasting. Then they came and said to Him, "Why do the disciples of John and of the Pharisees fast, but Your disciples do not fast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And Jesus said to them, "Can the friends of the bridegroom fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them they are not able to fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>But the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken away from them, and then they shall fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one sews a patch of a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment; or else [it] takes away its completeness, the new [piece] from the old [garment], and the tear becomes worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts new wine into old wineskins; otherwise the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine spills out, and the wineskins will be ruined. But new wine must be put into new wineskins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>Now it came about as He was going through the grainfields on the Sabbath, that His disciples began to make [their] way picking the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to Him, "Look, why do they do what is not lawful on the Sabbath?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>But He said to them, "Have you never read what David did when he was in need, and became hungry, he and those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he entered into the house of God at the time Abiathar [was] high priest, and ate the showbread, which is not lawful to eat, except for the priests, and also gave to those who were with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And He said to them, "The Sabbath came into being for the sake of man, and not man for the sake of the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So then the Son of Man is Lord, even of the Sabbath."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And He entered again into the synagogue. And a man was there who had a withered hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>And they were observing Him, whether He would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And He said to the [one] who had the withered hand, "Step forward."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then He said to them, "Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?"But they kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He said to the man, "Stretch out your hand."And he stretched it out, and his hand was restored as whole as the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>Then the Pharisees went out with the Herodians and immediately conspired against Him, how they might destroy Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>But Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea. And a large multitude from Galilee followed Him, and from Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Jerusalem and Idumea and beyond the Jordan, and those around Tyre and Sidon, a large multitude, when they heard everything He was doing, came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they should crush Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>For He had healed many, so that all who had afflictions were crowding upon Him, so that they might touch Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the unclean spirits, whenever they saw Him, fell down before Him and would cry out, saying, "You are the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And He would warn them very much that they should not make Him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And He went up on the mountain and summoned those whom He wanted, and they came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And He appointed twelve, so that they might be with Him, and so that He might send them out to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And He gave Simon the name Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James, He gave them the names Boanerges, which is, "Sons of Thunder";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And they came into a house. Then again a crowd assembled, so that they were not even able to eat food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>But when His relatives heard, they came out to seize Him, for they were saying, "He has lost His mind."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes who were from Jerusalem came down and were saying, "He has Beelzebul,"and, "By the ruler of the demons He casts out demons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And having summoned them, he began to say to them in parables: "How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom is not able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>And if a household is divided against itself, that household is not able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>And if Satan has risen up against himself and has become divided, he is not able to stand, but is finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his possessions, unless he first binds the strong man, and then he may plunder his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>"Assuredly I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the sons of men, also blasphemies, as many as they may blaspheme;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is under sentence of eternal condemnation"-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>because they were saying, "He has an unclean spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Then His brothers and His mother came, and as they stood outside they sent to Him, calling for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And a crowd was sitting around Him; and they said to Him, "Look, Your mother and Your brothers and Your sisters are seeking You outside."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>But He answered them, saying, "Who is My mother, or My brothers?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And when He had looked around in a circle at those sitting around Him, He said, "Here are My mother and My brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>For whoever does the will of God is My brother and My sister and mother."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again He began to teach beside the sea. And a large crowd was gathered to Him, so that He got aboard into the boat, and sat on the sea; and all the crowd was upon the land by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And He was teaching them many [things] by parables, and said to them in His teaching:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>"Listen! Behold, a sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it happened, as he sowed, that some [seed] fell alongside the road; and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And some fell on stony ground, where it did not have much earth; and immediately it sprang up because it had no depth of earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>But when the sun rose it was scorched, and because it had no root it was withered up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And some [seed ]fell into the thorns; and the thorns came up and choked it, and it yielded no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But other [seed ]fell on good ground, and it was yielding fruit coming up and growing, and it was producing-some thirty[fold], some sixty[,] and some a hundred."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And He said, "He that has ears to hear, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>But when He was by himself, those around Him together with the twelve asked Him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And He said to them, "Unto you it has been given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, all things come to be [spoken] in parables,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>so that 'Seeing they may see and not perceive, and hearing they may hear and not understand; Lest they should turn, and their sins be forgiven them.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And He said to them, "Do you not know this parable? How then will you know all the parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>And these are the [seeds] beside the road where the word is sown, and whenever they hear, immediately Satan comes and takes away the word which was sown in their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are similarly the [seeds] being sown on stony ground which, whenever they hear the word, immediately they receive it with joy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and they have no root in themselves, but are shortlived. Afterward, when trials or persecution arise because of the word, immediately they fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these are the [seeds] being sown in the thorns; they are the [ones] who are hearing the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the anxieties of this age, and the deceitfulness of riches, and the desires for other things coming in choke out the word, and it becomes fruitless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are the [seeds] sown on good ground, such as who hear the word and welcome it, and bear fruit: some thirty [fold], some sixty, and some a hundred."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And He said to them, "A lamp is not brought so that it may be put under a measuring basket or under a bed, [is it?] [Is it] not[ brought] so that it may be put on a lampstand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For there is nothing hidden which shall not be made manifest, nor was it hidden but that it might come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>Then He said to them, "Watch what you hear. By what measure you measure, it will be measured out to you; and [more] will be added to you who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whoever has, [more] will be given to him; and he who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And He said, "Thus is the kingdom of God as if a man should cast the seed on the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep by night and rise by day, and the seed should sprout and should grow, he himself does not know how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth produces fruit of itself: first a shoot, then a head of grain, then full wheat in the head of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But whenever the fruit permits, immediately he sends forth the sickle, because the harvest has come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>Then He said, "To what shall we compare the kingdom of God? Or by what sort of parable shall we illustrate it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a mustard seed, which whenever it is sown on the ground, is smaller than all the seeds on the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>but whenever it is sown, it comes up and becomes greater than all the garden vegetables, and produces great branches, so that the birds of heaven are able to nest under its shade."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>And by many such parables He would speak the word to them, just as they were able to hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>And apart from a parable He did not speak to them, however, privately to His disciples, he would explain all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, "Let us go across to the other side."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And leaving the crowd, they took Him along as He was in the boat. And other little boats were also with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there was a severe windstorm, and the waves dashed up into the boat, so that it was already filling up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But He was in the stern, sleeping upon the cushion. And they awakened Him and said to Him, "Teacher! Does it not matter to You that we are perishing?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And having awakened He rebuked the wind, and He said to the sea, "Peace, be still."And the wind abated and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>But He said to them, "Why are you so fearful? How [is it that] you do not have faith?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared exceedingly, and were saying to one another, "Who then is this, that even the wind and the sea obey Him!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>Then they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadarenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when He got out of the boat, immediately there met Him from the tombs a man with an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>who had his dwelling among the tombs. And no one could bind him, not even with chains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>because he often had been bound with shackles and chains, and the chains had been torn apart by him, and the shackles had been broken, and no one was able to subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And always, night and day, he was in the mountains and in the tombs, crying out and bruising himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But seeing Jesus from a distance, he ran and worshipped Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and crying out with a great voice he said, "What have I to do with You, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure You by God, do not torment me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For He was saying to him, "Come out from the man, unclean spirit!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And He was asking him, "What is your name?"And he answered, saying, "My name is Legion; for we are many."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he was imploring Him many [times] that He would not send them out of the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now there was a large herd of pigs feeding there near the mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>So all the demons implored Him, saying, "Send us into the pigs, that we may enter them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And immediately Jesus gave them permission. And when the unclean spirits came out, they entered into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, (there were about two thousand) and drowned in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>But those feeding the pigs fled, and they reported it in the city and in the country. And they came out to see what it was that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>Then they came to Jesus, and observed him who had been demon-possessed and had the legion, sitting and having been clothed and being of sound mind, and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And those who saw it related to them how it happened to him who had been demon-possessed, and about the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>Then they began to implore Him to go away from their region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And when He got into the boat, he who had been demon-possessed implored Him that he might be with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, "Go home to your own family, and report to them all the things that the Lord has done for you, and how He had compassion on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis all the things Jesus did for him; and all were marveling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>Now when Jesus had crossed over again in the boat to the other side, a large crowd was gathered to Him; and He was beside the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And behold, there came one of the rulers of the synagogue, named Jairus. And seeing Him, he fell at His feet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and was imploring Him many [times], saying, "My little daughter is near death, please come and lay Your hands on her, so that she may be healed, and live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And He went away with him. And a large crowd was following Him, and they were pressing against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>Now a certain woman, suffering from a flow of blood for twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>and who had suffered many things under many physicians, and who had spent everything at her disposal, and was no better, but rather having become worse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>when she heard about Jesus, she came from behind Him in the crowd and touched His clothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she was saying, "If only I may touch His clothes, I will be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she had been healed from her affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>And Jesus, immediately knowing in Himself that power had gone out of Him, He turned in the crowd [and] said, "Who touched My clothes?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>But His disciples said to Him, "You see the crowd pressing against You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And He was looking around to see her who had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>And He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace, and be healed of your affliction."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While He was still speaking, they came from the synagogue leader, saying, "Your daughter [has] died. Why do you still trouble the Teacher?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus, immediately when He heard the word being spoken, said to the synagogue leader, "Do not be afraid; only believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And He did not permit anyone to follow along with Him except for Peter, James, and John the brother of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And He went to the house of the synagogue leader, and observed a commotion, and [people] weeping and wailing, very much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And when He went in, He said to them, "Why are you making such commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but she is asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they were ridiculing Him. But putting them all out, He took along the father and the mother of the child, and those with Him, and He went in where the child was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And having grasped the hand of the child, He said to her, "Talitha, koumi,"which means, "Little girl, I say to you, arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And immediately the little girl arose and was walking about, for she was twelve years old. And they were overcome with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>But He ordered them strictly that no one should know this, and said that something should be given her to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>Then He went out from there and came to His hometown, and His disciples followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when the Sabbath had come, He began to teach in the synagogue. And many when they heard were astonished, saying, "Where did this Man get these things? And what wisdom is this which is given to Him, and such miracles are coming about by His hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is this not the carpenter, the Son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? And are not His sisters here with us?"And they were offended at Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>But Jesus said to them, "A prophet is not without honor except in his own hometown, and among his relatives, and in his own house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>and He could do no miracle there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick [people] and healed [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And He marveled because of their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And He called the twelve to Himself, and began to send them out two by two, and gave them power over unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>He commanded them that they should take nothing for the journey except a staff, only-no knapsack, no bread, nor a copper [coin] for their money belts-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but [to go] having put on sandals, and not to put on two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And He said to them, "Wherever you may enter into a house, stay there until you go out from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And as many as do not receive you nor hear you, as you leave from there, shake off the dust underneath your feet as a testimony against them. Assuredly, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Sodom or for Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And when they went out, they were preaching that [people] should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And they were casting out many demons, and they were anointing with oil many who were sick, and were healing [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>And King Herod heard, for His name became well known. And he said, "John the Baptizer has been raised from the dead, and for this reason the miracles are at work in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others said, "He is Elijah."But others said, "He is a prophet, like one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when he heard, Herod said, "It is John, whom I beheaded; he has been raised from the dead!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod himself had sent and laid hold of John, and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife; because he had married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For John would say to Herod, "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>Therefore Herodias held a grudge against him and was desiring to kill him, but she was not able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>for Herod was afraid of John, knowing that he was a just and holy man, and he was protecting him. And when he heard him, he did many things, but he would hear him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And when an opportune day arrived, when Herod for his birthday festivities was putting on a supper for his nobles, the high officers, and the chief men of Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>and when Herodias' daughter herself came in and danced, and pleased Herod and his dinner guests, the king said to the girl, "Ask me whatever you may want, and I will give it to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He also swore to her, "Whatever you may ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>And when she had gone out, she said to her mother, "What shall I ask?"And she said, "The head of John the Baptist!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>Immediately she came in with haste to the king and she requested, saying, "I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And the king became exceedingly sorry; yet, because of his oaths and of those who reclined with him, he did not want to refuse her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>And immediately the king, having sent an executioner, commanded his head to be brought. And having departed, he beheaded him in the prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought his head on a platter, and gave it to the girl; and the girl gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>And when his disciples heard, they came and took away his body and placed it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>Then the apostles gathered to Jesus and they reported to Him all things, both everything they had done and everything they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And He said to them, "Come, you yourselves privately, to a deserted place and rest a little."For there were many coming and going, and they were not even finding opportunity to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>And they went away to a deserted place in the boat privately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>But the multitudes saw them going, and many recognized Him, and ran together there on foot from all the cities, and preceded them, and they came together to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>And when He came out, Jesus saw a large crowd, and He had compassion on them, because they were like sheep not having a shepherd. So He began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And when it grew late, His disciples came to Him and said, "The place is deserted, and already the hour is late.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>Dismiss them, so that they may go into the surrounding farms and villages and may buy themselves food; for they have nothing to eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But answering, He said to them, "You give them [something] to eat."And they said to Him, "Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii [worth of] bread and give them [something ]to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>But He said to them, "How many loaves do you have? Go and see."And when they found out they said, "Five, and two fish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>Then He gave orders for them all to recline in groups on the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>And they reclined in parties of hundreds and of fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves, and was giving [them] to His disciples, so that they might set them before them; and the two fish He divided to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>So they all ate and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up twelve baskets full of fragments and from the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Now those who had eaten the loaves were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately He compelled His disciples to step into the boat and to go on ahead to the other side, to Bethsaida, until He could dismiss the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>And having taken leave of them, He departed to the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>Now when it was evening, the boat was in the middle of the sea; and He was alone on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>Then He saw them straining at rowing, for the wind was against them. Now about the fourth watch of the night He came to them walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>And seeing Him walking on the sea, they supposed Him to be a spirit, and they cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for they all saw Him and were troubled. But immediately He spoke with them, and said to them, "Have courage! [It is] I AM; do not be afraid."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>Then He went up with them into the boat and the wind ceased. And they were greatly astounded among themselves beyond measure, and were marveling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they had not understood concerning the loaves, because their heart was hardened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And having crossed over, they came to the land of Gennesaret and anchored there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they came out of the boat, immediately having recognized Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>running about that whole surrounding region, they began to carry about on beds those who were ill to wherever they would hear that He was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever He would enter into villages, or towns, or the country, they laid the sick in the marketplaces, and they would beg Him at least that they might touch the hem of His garment. And as many as touched Him were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes gathered together to Him, having come from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>Now when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with ceremonially unclean, that is, with unwashed [hands], they found fault.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands with [their] fist, holding the tradition of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>And [coming] from the marketplace, unless they bathe, they do not eat. And there are many other things which they have received [by tradition], like the washing of cups and pitchers, copper vessels and couches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but they eat bread with unwashed hands?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>And answering He said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy about you hypocrites, as it is written: 'This people honors Me with their lips, but their heart is far from Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>And in vain they worship Me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>"For having left the commandment of God, you hold to the tradition of men-the washing of pitchers and cups, and many other similar things you do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>And He said to them, "Well do you set aside the commandment of God, so that you may keep your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever speaks evil of father or mother, let him surely die.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, 'If a man says to [his] father or to [his ]mother, "Whatever you might be profited by me is Corban"- (that is, a gift),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>then you no longer allow him to do anything for his father or his mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>[thus] nullifying the word of God by your tradition which you have handed down. And many similar things you do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And having summoned all the crowd, He said to them, "Hear Me, all [of you] and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>There is nothing from outside a man, that entering into him, can defile him; but the things which come out of him, those are the things that defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>When He had entered a house [away] from the crowd, His disciples were asking Him about the parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>So He said to them, "Are you also without understanding? Do you not understand that everything entering a man from outside cannot defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it does not enter into his heart but into his stomach, and passes into the latrine, [thus] purifying all foods?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>And He said, "That which comes out of a man, that defiles a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, out of the heart of men, come forth evil thoughts, adulteries, fornications, murders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>thefts, covetousness, wickedness, deceit, lewdness, an evil eye, blasphemy, arrogance, foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>All these evil things come from within and defile a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>From there He arose and He went away into the region of Tyre and Sidon. And having entered into a house, He wanted no one to know it, but He was not able to escape notice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>For a woman whose young daughter had an unclean spirit heard about Him, and she came and fell at His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>Now the woman was a Greek, a Syro-Phoenician by race, and she was asking Him to cast the demon out from her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But Jesus said to her, "Let the children be filled first, for it is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>And she answered and said to Him, "Yes, Lord, yet even the little dogs underneath the table eat from the crumbs of the children."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>Then He said to her, "Because of this saying, go; the demon has gone out of your daughter."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>And going away to her house, she found the demon having gone out, and her daughter having been placed on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Again, coming out from the region of Tyre and Sidon, He went to the Sea of Galilee, in the midst of the region of Decapolis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>Then they brought to Him a deaf man impeded in speech, and they begged Him that He would lay His hand upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And when he had taken him aside from the crowd privately, He put His fingers in his ears, and having spit, He touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>Then looking up into heaven, He sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha,"that is, "Be opened."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>Immediately his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he was speaking correctly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And He ordered them that they should tell no one; but the more He ordered them, the more exceedingly they would proclaim it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, "He has done all things well. He makes both the deaf to hear and the mute to speak."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>In those days, when a great crowd had gathered, and not having anything to eat, Jesus, having summoned His disciples and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been remaining with Me three days and have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if I dismiss them hungry to their own houses, they will faint on the way; for some of them have come from a [great ]distance."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>Then His disciples answered Him, "From where will anyone be able to satisfy these [people] with bread here in this deserted place?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>He asked them, "How many loaves do you have?"And they said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>So He commanded the crowd to recline on the ground. And He took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, He broke [them ]and was giving [them] to His disciples, so that they might set [them] before [the people]; and they set them before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And they had a few small fish; and having blessed [them], He said to set them before [the people].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>So they ate and were filled, and they took up an abundance of fragments, seven hampers [full].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Now those having eaten were about four thousand. And He dismissed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>And immediately stepping into the boat with His disciples, He came to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>Then the Pharisees came out and began to question Him, seeking from Him a sign from heaven, testing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And sighing deeply in His spirit, He said, "Why does this generation seek a sign? Assuredly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And having dismissed them, and stepping into the boat again, He went away to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>And they forgot to take bread, and except [for] one loaf, they did not have [any] with themselves in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>Then He charged them, saying, "Look out, beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they were reasoning among themselves, saying, "because we have no bread."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>But Jesus, knowing about it, said to them, "Why are you reasoning because you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Is your heart still hardened?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>Having eyes, do you not see? And having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of fragments did you take up?"They said to Him, "Twelve."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>"And when [I broke] the seven for the four thousand, how many hampers full of fragments did you take up?"And they said, "Seven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>So He said to them, "How [is it] you do not understand?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>Then He came to Bethsaida; and they brought a blind man to Him, and implored Him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>And having taken the hand of the blind [man], He led him outside the village, and having spit on his eyes, and having laid His hands on him, He asked him if he saw anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>And when he looked up he said, "I see men like trees, walking."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Then He put His hands on his eyes again and made him to look up. And he was restored and saw everyone clearly again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>Then He sent him away to his house, saying, "Neither go into the village, nor tell anyone in the village."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>Now Jesus and His disciples went out to the villages of Caesarea Philippi; and on the road He was questioning His disciples, saying to them, "Who do men pronounce Me to be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>So they answered, "John the Baptist; and others [say], Elijah; but others, one of the prophets."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>He said to them, "But who do you pronounce Me to be?"Peter answered and said to Him, "You are the Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>Then He warned them that they should tell no one about Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And He began to teach them that it was necessary for the Son of Man to suffer many things, and to be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes, and to be killed, and after three days to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>He was speaking this word with boldness. And Peter, taking Him aside, began to rebuke Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But when He had turned and saw His disciples, He rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind Me, Satan! For you are not mindful of the things of God, but the things of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>And having summoned the crowd together with His disciples, He said to them, "Whoever is willing to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For whoever desires to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake and the gospel's, will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>For what shall it profit a man if he gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>Or what shall a man give [as] an equivalent for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>For whosoever is ashamed of Me and My words among this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will also be ashamed of him, whenever He comes in the glory of His Father with the holy angels."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.9'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>And He said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you that there are some standing here who will by no means taste death till they see the kingdom of God actually come in power."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Now after six days Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up into a high mountain alone by themselves. And He was transfigured before them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>and His clothes became shining, exceedingly white, like snow, such as no launderer on earth is able to whiten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And Elijah appeared to them together with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>Then Peter answered and said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it is good for us to be here; and let us make three tents: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah"-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>for he did not know what he should say, for they were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And a cloud appeared overshadowing them, and a voice came out of the cloud, [saying], "This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone, but only Jesus with themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And as they came down from the mountain, He commanded them that they should relate to no one the things they had seen, till the Son of Man should rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And this word they kept to themselves, questioning what it meant to rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they asked Him, saying, "Why do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>And answering He said to them, "Indeed, Elijah is coming first and restores all things. And how is it written concerning the Son of Man, that He must suffer many things and be treated with contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>But I say to you that indeed Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they wished, just as it is written concerning him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>And when He came to the disciples, He saw a large crowd around them, and scribes disputing with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>Immediately, when they saw Him, all the people were greatly amazed, and running to Him, they greeted Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And He asked the scribes, "What are you disputing about with them?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>Then one of the crowd answered and said, "Teacher, I brought my son to You, because he has a mute spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>And wherever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams at the mouth, and gnashes his teeth, and he becomes rigid. So I spoke to Your disciples, that they might cast it out, but they were not able."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>He answered him and said, "O unbelieving generation, how long shall I be with you? How long shall I bear with you? Bring him to Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>Then they brought the boy to Him. And when he saw Him, immediately the spirit convulsed him, and having fallen on the ground he was rolling about, foaming at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>So He asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?"And he said, "From childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And often it threw him both into the fire and into the waters so that it may destroy him. But if You are able [to do] anything, help us and have compassion on us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said to him, "If you are able to believe: all things are possible to him that believes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>And immediately crying out, the father of the child said with tears, "I believe, Lord; help my unbelief!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>When Jesus saw that a crowd was running together, He rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to him, "Mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and enter him no more!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>Then having cried out and having convulsed him greatly, it came out. And he became as one dead, so that many were saying, "He is dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>But Jesus, having grasped him by the hand, lifted him up, and he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>And after He entered into a house, His disciples asked Him privately, "Why were we not able to cast it out?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>So He said to them, "This kind can come out by nothing but prayer and fasting."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>And having gone out from there they were passing through Galilee, and He did not wish that anyone should know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>For He was teaching His disciples and said to them, "The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of men, and they will kill Him. And after He is killed, He will rise on the third day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>But they did not understand this saying, and were afraid to ask Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>Then He came to Capernaum. And being in the house He asked them, "What were you disputing about with one another on the road?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>But they were silent, for on the road they had discussed with one another who [was] greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>And having sat down He called the twelve, and said to them, "If anyone desires to be first, he shall be last of all and servant of all."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>And taking a child, He stood him in their midst. And taking him in His arms, He said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>whoever receives one of these little children in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me, receives not Me, but Him who sent Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>Now John answered Him, saying, "Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow with us casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>But Jesus said, "Do not forbid him, for there is no one who will perform a miracle in My name that will be able to soon speak evil of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>For he who is not against you is for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>For whoever gives you a cup of water to drink in My name, because you are Christ's, assuredly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>"But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, it would be better for him if a millstone were around his neck, and he be cast into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter into life maimed, than to enter having two hands, to go into hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>"And if your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It would be better for you to enter into life lame, than having two feet to be cast into hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched-</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>"And if your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It would be better for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, than having two eyes to be cast into the fiery hell,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>where 'Their worm does not die, and the fire is not quenched.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>Then He arose from there and came to the region of Judea by the other side of the Jordan. And again crowds came together to Him, and as He was accustomed, He was teaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>And some Pharisees approached and asked Him, "Is it lawful for a husband to put away his wife?"testing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>But answering He said to them, "What did Moses command you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>They said, "Moses permitted [a man] to write a certificate of divorce, and to put her away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>And Jesus answered and said to them, "In view of your hardheartedness he wrote this commandment for you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.9'>Therefore what God has united together, let not man separate."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>In the house His disciples also asked Him again concerning the same [matter].</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>Now as He was going out into the road, one came running up, and having knelt before Him, he asked Him, "Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>So Jesus said to him, "Why do you call Me good? No one is good except One, God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>You know the commandments: 'Do not commit adultery,' 'Do not commit murder,' 'Do not steal,' 'Do not bear false witness,' 'Do not defraud,' 'Honor your father and your mother.' "</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.10.22'>But having become gloomy at this saying, he went away grieving, for he had many possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.23'>And looking around, Jesus says to His disciples, "How difficult it is for those having riches to enter the kingdom of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.24'>And the disciples were astonished at His words. But Jesus, answering again, says to them, "Children, how difficult it is for those who trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>Then He began to speak to them with parables: "A man planted a vineyard and set a fence around it, dug a wine vat and built a tower. And he leased it to farmers, and went on a journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And at [harvest] time he sent a servant to the farmers, in order that he might receive [his part] from the fruit of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>And they took him and beat [him] and sent [him] away empty-[handed].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>Again he sent them another servant, and that one they wounded in the head with stones, and they sent him away shamefully treated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And again he sent another, and that one they killed, and [so with ]many others, beating some and killing others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>Therefore still having one son, his beloved, he even sent him to them last, saying, 'They will respect my son.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>"And taking him they killed [him], and cast [him] out of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>Therefore what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and will destroy the farmers, and give the vineyard to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>Have you not even read this Scripture: 'The stone which the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.11'>This was the LORD's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to lay hold of Him, but they feared the crowd, for they knew that He had spoken the parable against them. And leaving Him, they went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>Then they sent to Him some of the Pharisees and the Herodians, in order that they might catch Him in [His ]discourse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And they came and said to Him, "Teacher, we know that You are true, and it does not make a difference to you about anyone; for You do not look on the face of men, but you teach the way of God in truth. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>Should we give, or should we not give?"But He, knowing their hypocrisy, said to them, "Why do you test Me? Bring Me a denarius, that I may see it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>So they brought [one]. And He said to them, "Whose image and inscription is this?"And they said to Him, "Caesar's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>And Jesus answered and said to them, "Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."And they marveled at Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Then some Sadducees came to Him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked Him, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>"Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies and leaves behind a wife and leaves no children, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>[Now] there were seven brothers. The first took a wife and he died, and left no offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and died; nor did he leave any offspring. And the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>So the seven had her and left no offspring. Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>[Therefore], in the resurrection, when they shall arise, whose wife of them will she be? For all seven had her [as] wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jesus answered and said to them, "Is this not the reason you are mistaken, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For whenever they rise from among the dead, neither do they marry nor are they given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>But concerning the dead, that they rise, have you not read in the book of Moses, in connection with [the burning] bush [passage], how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>He is not the God of [the ]dead, but the God of [the] living. Therefore you are greatly mistaken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>Then one of the scribes came, after he heard them reasoning together, and perceiving that He had answered them well, asked Him, "Which is the first commandment of all?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jesus answered him, "The first of all the commandments is: 'Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God is one LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>' And you shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.' This is the first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>And the second, like it, is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>So the scribe said to Him, "Well [said], Teacher, in truth You said that He is one, and there is no other besides Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>And to love Him with the whole heart, and with the whole understanding, with all the soul, and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Now when Jesus saw that he answered intelligently, He said to him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God."And no one dared any longer to question Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>Then Jesus answered and said, as [He was] teaching in the temple, "How say the scribes that the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself said by the Holy Spirit: 'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand, Till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>"Therefore David himself calls Him 'Lord'; how then is He his Son?"And the large crowd was hearing Him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>Then He said to them in His teaching, "Take heed of the scribes, who like to walk about in long robes, and [like] greetings in the marketplaces,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.39'>and the first seats in the synagogues, and the first couches at the suppers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>who devour widows' houses, and for a pretense pray at length. These will receive more abundant judgment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>And Jesus sat down opposite the treasury, and was observing how the crowd was putting money into the treasury. And many rich [people] were putting in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>Then one poor widow came and put in two lepta, which equals a quadrans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And having summoned His disciples, He said to them, "Assuredly, I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all those who are putting into the treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For they all put in out of their excess, but this woman, out of her destitution, put in everything she had, her whole livelihood."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.13'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.1'>And as He was going out from the temple, one of His disciples said to Him, "Teacher, see what sort of stones and what sort of buildings!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.2'>And Jesus answered and said to him, "Do you see these great buildings? By no means shall one stone be left upon another, which shall in any way escape destruction."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.3'>And He was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew asked Him privately,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.4'>Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign when all these things are about to be fulfilled?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>And Jesus, answering them, began to say: "Take heed lest anyone deceive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.6'>For many will come in My name, saying, 'I AM,' and they will deceive many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.7'>But whenever you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be disturbed; for these things must occur, but the end is not yet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.8'>For nation will be raised up against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be earthquakes in various places, and there will be famines and disturbances. These [are] the beginnings of birth pangs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.9'>But take heed to yourselves, for they will deliver you up to councils, and you will be flogged in the synagogues. You will stand before rulers and kings for My sake, as a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.10'>And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.11'>But whenever they lead you forth to deliver you over, do not worry beforehand [as to ]what you will say, nor rack your brains. But whatever is given you in that hour, speak this; for it is not you who is speaking, but the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.12'>Now brother will deliver up brother to death, and a father his child; and children will rise up against parents and will cause them to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.13'>And you will be hated by all on account of My name. But he who endures to the end shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.13.14'>"So whenever you see the 'abomination of desolation,' spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing where he must not"-he who reads, let him understand-"then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>But they said, "Not during the feast, lest there be a disturbance of the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>And while He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as He was reclining for a meal, a woman came having an alabaster flask of very costly pure nard. And having broken the flask, she began to pour it out over His head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>But some were expressing indignation to one another and saying, "Why has this waste of the perfume occurred?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>For it was possible [for] this to be sold for more than three hundred denarii, and to be given to the poor."And they were scolding her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has worked a beautiful work for Me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.39'>And He went away again and He prayed, saying the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.40'>And having returned, He found them sleeping again, for their eyes were heavy; and they did not know what they should answer Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>And Jesus said, "I am. And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Then the high priest tore his clothes and said, "What further need do we have of witnesses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>You have heard the blasphemy! How does it appear to you?"And they all condemned Him to be deserving of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Then some began to spit on Him, and to blindfold Him, and to beat Him with [their] fists, and to say to Him, "Prophesy!"And the attendants were striking Him with slaps [to the face.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Now as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>And when she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, "You also were with Jesus the Nazarene."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied it, saying, "I neither know nor understand what you are saying."And he went outside into the forecourt, and a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And the servant girl seeing him again, began to say to those standing by, "This [man] is one of them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But again he was denying [it]. And a little later those who were standing by said to Peter again, "Truly you are one of them; for you are also a Galilean, and your accent is like [theirs]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>Then he began to curse and to swear, "I do not know this Man whom you are speaking of"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And for the second [time] a rooster crowed. Then Peter remembered the word that Jesus had said to him, "Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny Me three times."And when he thought about it, he began to weep.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>Immediately, in the morning, the chief priests held a consultation, along with the elders and scribes and the whole Sanhedrin; and having bound Jesus, they led [Him] away, and delivered [Him] to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Then Pilate asked Him, "Are You the King of the Jews?"And He answered and said to him, "You are saying [what is so]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests were accusing Him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>Then Pilate questioned Him again, saying, "Do You answer nothing? See how many things they testify against You!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus no longer answered anything, so that Pilate marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>Now at the feast he would release one prisoner to them, whomever they would request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>And there was one called Barabbas, having been bound with his fellow rebels, who had committed murder in the rebellion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>Then the crowd cried out and began to request [that] just as always he would do [this] for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>But Pilate answered them, saying, "Do you desire that I release to you the King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that because of envy the chief priests had delivered Him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests stirred up the crowd, so that he should rather release Barabbas to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>But Pilate answered and said to them again, "What then do you desire [that] I should do [with Him ]whom you call King of the Jews?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And again they cried, "Crucify Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>But Pilate said to them, "Why, what evil did He do?"But they cried out all the more, "Crucify Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>So Pilate, wanting to gratify the crowd, released Barabbas to them; and he delivered up Jesus, after he had Him flogged, so that He might be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>Then the soldiers led Him away into the courtyard, which is the Praetorium, and assembled the whole garrison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>And they clothed Him with purple; and they twisted a crown of thorns, and they put it around His head,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and they began to salute Him, "Hail, King of the Jews!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>And they were striking His head with a reed and were spitting on Him; and bowing the knee, they [mockingly ]worshipped Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked Him, they stripped Him of the purple, and dressed Him in His own clothing. And led Him out so that they might crucify Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>And they pressed into service a certain [man] [that was] passing by [named] Simon, a Cyrenian, the father of Alexander and Rufus, as he was coming from the country, that he might carry His cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought Him to the place [called ]Golgotha, which is translated, Place of a Skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave Him wine mingled with myrrh to drink, but He did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And having crucified Him, they divided His clothes by casting lots over them,[ to determine] who would take what.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>Now it was the third hour, and they crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And there was the inscription of His charge having been inscribed: THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And together with Him they crucified two bandits, one on His right side and the one on His left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>So the Scripture was fulfilled which says, "And He was numbered with the transgressors."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>And those passing by were blaspheming Him, shaking their heads and saying, "Aha! You who destroy the temple and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save Yourself, and come down from the cross!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise the chief priests also, mocking [Him] to each other with the scribes said, "He saved others; Himself He is not able to save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross, so that we may see and believe Him."Even those who were crucified with Him were reviling Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>Now when the sixth hour had come, darkness came upon the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And at the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eloi, Eloi, lima sabachthani?"which is translated, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>Some of those standing by when they heard, said, "Look, He is calling Elijah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>And one, running and having filled a sponge [with] vinegar, and having put it around a reed, was giving a drink to Him, saying, "Leave Him alone; let us see if Elijah is coming to take Him down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>And Jesus, uttering a loud cry, expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>Then the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>Now when the centurion who stood across from Him saw that He cried out like this and breathed His last, he said, "Truly this Man was the Son of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were both Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joses, and Salome,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>who also would follow Him and would minister to Him when He was in Galilee; and many other women who had come up together with Him to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>And now evening having come, since it was Preparation Day, which is the day before the Sabbath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>Joseph of Arimathea, a prominent council member, who was himself waiting for the kingdom of God, coming and taking courage, he went in to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>And Pilate wondered if He was already dead; and having summoned the centurion, he questioned him if He had been dead long.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>And when he found out from the centurion, he granted the body to Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And having bought linen cloth, and having taken Him down, he wrapped Him in the linen cloth and set Him down in a tomb which had been cut out of a rock, and rolled a stone upon the door of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>And Mary Magdalene and Mary [the mother] of Joses were observing where He was placed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>Now when the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene, and Mary[ the mother] of James, and Salome bought spices, so that they might come and anoint Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>And very early on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>And they said to one another, "Who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And having looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away-for it was exceedingly large.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And entering into the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right clothed with a white robe, and they were alarmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, "Do not be alarmed. You are seeking Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has arisen! He is not here! See the place where they put Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, say to His disciples, and Peter, that He is going before you into Galilee; there you shall see Him, just as He said to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And going out, they fled from the tomb, but trembling and amazement held them; and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>Now having arisen early on the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom He had cast out seven demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>She went and reported to those who had been with Him, as they were grieving and weeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And those, when they heard that He was alive and had been seen by her, [they ]disbelieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After that, He appeared in a different form to two of them as they were going into the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And those returned and reported it to the rest; but neither did they believe them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>Afterwards He appeared to the eleven as they were reclining at the table; and He rebuked their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they did not believe those who saw Him after He had been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And He said to them, "Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to all creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He that believes and is baptized shall be saved; but he that does not believe shall be condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall accompany those who have believed: In My name they shall cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>they shall pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means hurt them; they shall lay hands on [the] sick, and they shall be well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>So then, after the Lord had spoken to them, He was taken up into heaven, and sat down at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went out and preached everywhere, the Lord working with [them] and confirming the word through the accompanying signs. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Since many have attempted to arrange a narrative about the matters which have taken place among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the word delivered [them] to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>it seemed good to me also, having followed up accurately all things from above, to write to you in orderly fashion, most distinguished Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>so that you may know the certainty of those things in which you were instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the division of Abijah. His wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>But they had no children, because Elizabeth was barren, and they were both well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>So it was, that while he was serving as priest before God in the order of his division,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>according to the custom of the priesthood, he was selected to burn incense when he entered into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>Then an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, "Do not be afraid, Zacharias, because your prayer has been heard; and your wife Elizabeth will bear a son to you, and you shall call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And you will have joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great before the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink. He will also be filled with the Holy Spirit, while still in his mother's womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And he will turn many of the sons of Israel to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he himself will go before Him in the spirit and power of Elijah, 'to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,' and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, to make ready a people prepared for the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, "How shall I know this? For I am an old man, and my wife is well advanced in years."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answered and said to him, "I am Gabriel, who stands before God, and I was sent to speak to you and to proclaim the good news to you of these things[.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>But behold, you shall be silent and not able to speak until the day these things take place, because you did not believe my words which shall be fulfilled in their season."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people waited for Zacharias, and they marveled at his delaying in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>But having come out, he was unable to speak to them; and they recognized that he had seen a vision in the temple, for he was making signs to them and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it happened, as soon as the days of his service were fulfilled, that he went away to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>Now after those days Elizabeth his wife conceived; and stayed in seclusion five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>"Thus the Lord has dealt with me, in the days when He looked on [me], to take away my reproach among men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>Now in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city of Galilee named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin betrothed to a man named Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin's name [was] Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel came to her and said, "Greetings, O favored [one], the Lord is with you; blessed [are] you among women!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>But when she saw [him], she was greatly perplexed by his saying, and she wondered what sort of greeting this was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>Then the angel said to her, "Fear not, Mary, for you have found grace with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And behold, you shall conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son, and you shall call His name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Most High; and the Lord God shall give Him the throne of His father David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And He shall reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there shall be no end."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then Mary said to the angel, "How can this be, since I do not know a man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said to her, "The Holy Spirit shall come upon you, and the power of the Most High shall overshadow you; therefore, also, that Holy Baby which is to be born shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And behold, Elizabeth your relative has also conceived a son in her old age; and this is now the sixth month for she who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing shall be impossible."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Then Mary said, "Behold the maidservant of the Lord! May it be to me according to your word."And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Now Mary rose up in those days and traveled into the hill country with haste, to a city of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>and entered the house of Zacharias and greeted Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, that when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, that the baby leaped in her womb; and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>Then she spoke out with a loud voice and said, "Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why am I favored thus, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For behold, as soon as the voice of your greeting sounded in my ears, the baby leaped for joy in my womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she who has believed, because there shall be a fulfillment to the things having been spoken to her from the Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said: "My soul magnifies the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>and my spirit has rejoiced in God my Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>Because He looked upon the lowly state of His maidservant; for behold, henceforth all generations will call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For He that is mighty has done great things for me, and holy is His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And His mercy is on those who fear Him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He has shown strength with His arm; He has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He has overthrown the mighty from their thrones, and exalted the lowly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He has filled the hungry with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He has helped His servant Israel, in remembrance of His mercy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>As He spoke to our fathers, to Abraham and to his seed forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary remained with her about three months, and she returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elizabeth's full time came for her to be delivered, and she bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And when her neighbors and relatives heard how the Lord had shown great mercy to her, they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>Now it came to pass on the eighth day, [that] they came to circumcise the child; and they started to call him by the name of his father, Zacharias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>His mother answered and said, "No; he shall be called John."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>But they said to her, "There is no one among your relatives who is called by this name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>So they made signs to his father about what he wished him to be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And asking for a writing tablet, he wrote, saying, "His name is John."And they all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>Immediately his mouth was opened and his tongue loosed, and he started to speak, praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Then fear came on all who lived around them; and all these things were being talked about throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all those who heard them kept them in their hearts, saying, "What kind of child will this be?"And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>Now his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>"Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been since the world began,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>to perform the mercy [promised] to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>the oath which He swore to our father Abraham:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>to grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>"And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>to give light to them that sit in darkness and [in ]the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>So the child grew and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his manifestation to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census be taken of all the empire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This census [was ]the first [one] while Quirinius was governing Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all were traveling to be registered, each to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>to be registered with Mary, his betrothed wife, who was pregnant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>So it was, that while they were there, the days were completed [for] her to bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she bore her firstborn Son, and wrapped Him in swaddling cloths, and laid Him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And shepherds were in the same country, living in the fields and keeping watch over their flock by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were greatly afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>Then the angel said to them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this [will be] the sign to you: You will find a Baby wrapped in swaddling cloths, lying in a manger."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God and saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>"Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, goodwill toward men!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>So it was, when the angels had departed from them into heaven, that the shepherds said to one another, "Let us go then to Bethlehem and see this thing that has come to pass, which the Lord has made known to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the Baby lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they had seen Him, they made widely known the saying which was told them concerning this Child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all those who heard it marveled about the things spoken by the shepherds to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary treasured all these things and pondered [them] in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>Then the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was spoken to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were completed, so they could circumcise Him, His name was called JESUS, the [name] given by the angel before He was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>Now when the days of their purification according to the law of Moses were completed, they brought Him to Jerusalem to present [Him] to the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(just as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the LORD"),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>and to offer a sacrifice according to what had been said in the law of the Lord, "A pair of doves or two young pigeons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And behold, there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon, and this man was just and devout, waiting for the Consolation of Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not see death before he should see the Lord's Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>So he came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the Child Jesus, that they might do for Him according to the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>he took Him up in his arms and blessed God and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>"Lord, now You are releasing Your servant in peace, according to Your word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>for my eyes have seen Your salvation</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>which You have prepared before the face of all peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>a light for a revelation to the Gentiles, and a glory to Your people Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and His mother were marveling at the things being spoken about Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Then Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary His mother, "Behold, this Child is destined for the fall and rise of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also), so that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>Now there was one, Anna, a prophetess, a daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher. She was of a great age, and had lived with a husband seven years from her virginity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>and she [was] a widow of about eighty-four years, who did not depart from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And coming in that instant she was giving thanks to the Lord, and was speaking about Him to all those who waited for redemption in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>So when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee, to their own city, Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the Child was growing and becoming strong in spirit, being filled with wisdom; and the grace of God was upon Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>And His parents traveled to Jerusalem every year to the Feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when He was twelve years old, when they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>and when they completed the days, while they were returning, the Child Jesus remained in Jerusalem; and Joseph and His mother did not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>But supposing Him to be in the caravan, they went a day's journey, and sought Him among their relatives and among their acquaintances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And when they did not find Him, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>Now it came to pass that after three days they found Him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them and questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And those who heard Him were astonished at His understanding and His answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw Him, they were amazed; and His mother said to Him, "Child, why have You treated us this way? Look, Your father and I were seeking You anxiously."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And He said to them, "Why [is it] that you were seeking Me? Did you not know that I must be about My Father's business?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>But they did not understand the statement which He spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>Then He went down with them and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them. And His mother kept all these things in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, while Pontius Pilate was governing Judea, and while Herod governed as tetrarch of Galilee, and while Philip his brother governed as tetrarch of Iturea and the region of Trachonitis, and while Lysanias governed as tetrarch of Abilene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>in the time of the high priest Annas and [the high priest ]Caiaphas, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he went into all the surrounding region of the Jordan, preaching a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>as it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the LORD, make His paths straight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.5'>Every valley shall be filled and every mountain and hill shall be humbled; the crooked roads shall become straight, and the rough [roads] shall become smooth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>and all flesh shall see the salvation of God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then he said to the crowds which came out to be baptized by him, "Brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Therefore produce fruits worthy of repentance, and do not begin to say among yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father.' For I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham out of these stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.9'>And even now the ax is being laid to the root of the trees. Therefore every tree which does not bear good fruit is cut down and is thrown into the fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.10'>So the people were asking him, saying, "What shall we do then?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.11'>He answered and said to them, "He who has two shirts, let him give to him who has none; and he who has food, let him do likewise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.12'>Then tax collectors also came to be baptized, and said to him, "Teacher, what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.13'>And he said to them, "Collect nothing more than the [amount] which has been commanded to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.14'>Likewise the soldiers also were asking him, saying, "And what shall we do?"So he said to them, "Do not intimidate anyone or accuse [anyone ]falsely, and be content with your wages."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.15'>Now while the people waited, and all considered in their hearts about John, whether he might be the Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.16'>John answered, saying to all, "I indeed baptize you with water; but One mightier than I is coming, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to loose. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.17'>whose winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly purge His threshing floor, and will gather the wheat into His barn; but the chaff He will burn up with unquenchable fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.18'>And with many other exhortations he proclaimed the good news to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.19'>But Herod the tetrarch, being rebuked by him concerning Herodias, his brother's wife, and for all the evils which Herod had done,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.20'>he also added this to all [his other] [sins], and locked up John in the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.21'>Now it came to pass that when all the people were baptized, that Jesus also was baptized, and [was] praying, [that ]the heaven was opened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.22'>and the Holy Spirit descended in bodily form like a dove upon Him, and a voice came out of heaven, saying, "You are My beloved Son; in You I have found delight."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.1'>Then Jesus, being filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan and was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.2'>being tempted [for] forty days by the devil. And in those days He ate nothing, and afterward, when they were completed, He was hungry.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.5'>Then the devil, leading Him up on a high mountain, showed Him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.6'>And the devil said to Him, "All this authority I will give You, and their glory; because it has been given to me, and I give it to whomever I wish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.25'>But I tell you truly, [there] were many widows in Israel in the days of Elijah, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, and there was a great famine all over the land;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.28'>So all those in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were filled with wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.29'>and rising up they threw Him out of the city; and brought Him to the brow of the hill on which their city was built, in order to throw Him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.30'>But having passed through the midst of them, He went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Then He went down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and He was teaching them on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.32'>And they were astonished at His teaching, because His word was with authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>Now in the synagogue [there] was a man who had a spirit of an unclean demon. And he cried out with a loud voice,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be silenced, and come out from him!"And when the demon had thrown him down in their midst, it came out from him, and did not hurt him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>And amazement came upon all, and they spoke among themselves, saying, "What [is] this word! For with authority and power He commands the unclean spirits, and they come out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.37'>And the report about Him went out into every place of the surrounding region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>And when He arose from the synagogue, He entered into the house of Simon. But Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, and they made request of Him about her.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>And also demons were coming out of many, crying out and saying, "You are the Christ, the Son of God!"And rebuking [them], He did not allow them to speak, because they knew that He was the Messiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>Now when it was day, He departed and went into a deserted place. And the crowds were searching for Him, and they came to Him, and tried to restrain Him from leaving them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>but He said to them, "I must proclaim the good news [of] the kingdom of God to the other cities also, because for this [purpose] I have been sent."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>Then He got into one of the boats, which was Simon's, and He asked him to put out a little from the land. And sitting down, He began to teach the crowds from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>Now when He had stopped speaking, He said to Simon, "Put out into the deep and lower your nets for a catch."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>But Simon answered and said to Him, "Master, we have labored all night and caught nothing; nevertheless at Your word I will lower the net."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>And when they had done this, they caught a great multitude of fish, and their net was tearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>So they beckoned to their partners who were in the other boat to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats, so that they were sinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus' knees, saying, "Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, O Lord!"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>And likewise also [it gripped] James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, "Do not fear; from now on you shall be catching men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>And having brought the boats to land, they left everything and followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>And it came to pass while He was in a certain city, that behold, there was a man full of leprosy. And when he saw Jesus, falling on his face he begged Him, saying, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>And He ordered him to tell no one, "But go and show yourself to the priest, and bring an offering for your cleansing, as a testimony to them, just as Moses prescribed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>But the report about Him spread all the more; and great crowds came together to hear, and to be healed by Him from their sicknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>But He Himself would withdraw into the wilderness and would pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>Now it happened on a certain day that He was teaching, and Pharisees and teachers of the law were sitting there[,] who had come out of every village of Galilee, Judea, and Jerusalem. And the power of the Lord was [present] to heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>And behold, men [were] carrying on a bed a man who was paralyzed, and they were seeking to bring him in and to lay [him ]before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>And when they could not find how they might bring him in, because of the crowd, going up on the roof, they lowered him down with his bed through the tiles into the midst in front of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>And seeing their faith, He said to him, "Man, your sins have been forgiven you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>And the scribes and the Pharisees began to reason, saying, "Who is this [Man ]who speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins except God alone?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>Then He spoke a parable to them: "No one puts a patch of a new garment on an old one; otherwise both the new [garment] tears, and also the patch that was taken out of the new [garment ]does not match with the old [garment].</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. And when He was already not far away from the house, the centurion sent friends to Him, saying to Him, "Lord, do not trouble Yourself, for I am not worthy that You should enter under my roof.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when a large crowd had gathered, and the [people] came to Him from every city, He spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went out to sow his seed. And as he sowed, some fell alongside the road; and it was trampled down, and the birds of the air devoured it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And other [seed] fell among thorns, and when the thorns grew up with it, they choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>But other [seed] fell into good ground, and when it grew up, it produced fruit a hundredfold."Saying these things He was calling out, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>Then His disciples asked Him, saying, "What does this parable mean?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And He said, "To you it has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God, but to the rest [they are] in parables, that 'Seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>But those on the rock are they that, whenever they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who believe for a while and in time of testing fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell among thorns, these are those, who when they heard, go out and are choked with anxieties, riches, and pleasures of life, and bring no fruit to maturity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that which fell on the good ground, these are such who when they heard the word, with a noble and good heart, hold on to it and bear fruit with endurance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>For He had commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man. For it had seized him at times, and he was bound, kept under guard, with chains and shackles; and he broke the bonds and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him, saying, "What is your name?"And he said, "Legion,"because many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>And he kept imploring Him that He would not command them to go out into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>Now there was a herd of many swine feeding there on the mountain. And they kept imploring Him that He would permit them to enter them. And He permitted them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>Then when the demons came out from the man, they entered into the swine, and the herd ran violently down the steep bank into the lake and drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>And when those who fed [them] saw what had happened, they fled and reported [it] in the city and in the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then they went out to see what had happened, and they came to Jesus, and found the man from whom the demons had come out [of], sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed and being of sound mind. And they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>And those also who saw reported to them how the demon-possessed man was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>Then the whole multitude from the surrounding region of the Gadarenes asked Him to go away from them, because they were gripped with great fear. And He got into the boat and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>Now the man from whom the demons had come out was begging Him that he might be with Him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>"Return to your house, and tell what great things God has done for you."And he departed, proclaiming throughout the whole city all the things that Jesus did for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>So it was, when Jesus returned, that the crowd welcomed Him, for they were all waiting for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a leader of the synagogue. And falling at the feet of Jesus, he was imploring Him to enter into his house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>for he had an only daughter about twelve years of age, and she was dying. But as He was going, the crowds were pressing against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>Now a woman, having a flow of blood for twelve years, who though she had spent [her] whole livelihood on physicians, was not able to be healed by anyone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>approaching from behind, touched the hem of His garment. And immediately her flow of blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>And Jesus said, "Who touched Me?"When all denied it, Peter and those with him said, "Master, the crowds are pressing You hard and crowding You, and You say, 'Who touched Me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>But Jesus said, "Someone touched Me, for I perceived that power has gone out from Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>Now when the woman saw that she was not hidden, she came trembling; and falling down before Him, she recounted to Him before all the people the reason why she had touched Him and how she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>And He said to her, "Take courage, daughter, your faith has healed you. Go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While He was still speaking, someone came from the ruler of the synagogue's house, saying to him, "Your daughter has died. Do not trouble the Teacher."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>But when Jesus heard it, He answered him, saying, "Do not be afraid; only believe, and she will be healed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When He came into the house, He permitted no one to enter except Peter, John, and James, and the father and mother of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>Now all were weeping and mourning for her; but He said, "Do not weep; she is not dead, but asleep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>And they were ridiculing Him, knowing that she had died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>But He sent them all outside, and having grasped her hand, He called, saying, "Child, arise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>Then her spirit returned, and she arose immediately. And He commanded [something] to be given to her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>And her parents were amazed, but He charged them to tell no one what had happened.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>And having called together the twelve, He gave them power and authority over all demons, and to heal diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>And He sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>And He said to them, "Take nothing for the journey, neither staffs nor knapsack nor bread nor silver; and do not have two tunics apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.4'>Whatever house you may enter, stay there, and from there go out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.5'>And as many as will not receive you, when you go out from that city, shake off the very dust from your feet as a testimony against them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>As they went out, they were going about village by village, preaching the gospel and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Now Herod the tetrarch heard of all the things[ ]being done by Him; and he was perplexed, because it was said by some that John had risen from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>and by others that Elijah had appeared, and by others that one of the ancient prophets had arisen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>And Herod said, "John I have beheaded, but who is this about whom I hear such things?"And he was seeking to see Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>And the apostles, when they had returned, recounted to Him all that they had done. And taking them along, He withdrew privately into a deserted place belonging to the city called Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>But when the crowds found out, they followed Him; and He welcomed them, and was speaking to them about the kingdom of God, and He cured those who needed healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>Now when the day began to decline, the twelve came and said to Him, "Dismiss the crowd, so that they may go into the surrounding villages and farms, and they may find lodging and find provisions; for we are in a deserted place here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>But He said to them, "You give them [something] to eat."And they said, "We have no more than five loaves of bread and two fish, unless we go and buy food for all these people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>For there were about five thousand men. And He said to His disciples, "Make them recline in groups of fifty."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>And they did so, and made them all recline.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>And taking the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke them, and gave them to the disciples to set before the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>So they all ate and were satisfied, and twelve baskets of the remaining fragments were taken up by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>And it came to pass, while He was alone praying, that His disciples joined Him, and He questioned them, saying, "Who do the crowds pronounce Me to be?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>So they answered and said, "John the Baptist, but some say Elijah; and others say that one of the ancient prophets has arisen."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>He said to them, "But who do you pronounce Me to be?"Peter answered and said, "The Christ of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>And He strictly warned and commanded [them] to tell this to no one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>saying, "The Son of Man must suffer many things, and be rejected by the elders and chief priests and scribes, and to be killed, and to be raised on the third day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>Then He said to them all, "If anyone desires to come after Me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>For whoever desires to save his life shall lose it, but whoever loses his life for My sake shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>For what is a man profited if he gains the whole world, and is himself destroyed or lost?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>For whoever is ashamed of Me and My words, of him the Son of Man will be ashamed when He comes in His own glory, and in His Father's, and of the holy angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.27'>But I tell you truly, there are some standing here who will by no means taste death until they see the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>Now it came to pass, about eight days after these words, that He took Peter, John, and James and went up on the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And while He was praying, the appearance of His face [became ]different, and His clothing [became] white and glistening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And behold, two men were talking with Him, who were Moses and Elijah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>who appearing in glory were talking about His decease which He was about to accomplish in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>But Peter and those with him were heavy with sleep; but becoming fully awake, they saw His glory and the two men who stood with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it happened, as they were parting from Him, that Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it is good [for] us to be here; and let us make three tents: one for You, one for Moses, and one for Elijah,"not knowing what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>Now as he said these things, a cloud appeared and overshadowed them; and they were afraid as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And a voice came out of the cloud, saying, "This is My beloved Son. Hear Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>When the voice had ceased, Jesus was found alone. But they kept silent, and reported to no one in those days any of the things they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>Now it happened on the next day, when they came down from the mountain, that a great crowd met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And behold, a man from the crowd cried out, saying, "Teacher, I beg You, look upon my son, for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And behold, a spirit seizes him, and he suddenly cries out, and it convulses him so that he foams at the mouth, and it departs from him with great difficulty, bruising him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>So I begged Your disciples that they might cast it out, but they could not."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Then Jesus answered and said, "O faithless and perverted generation, how long shall I be with you and bear with you? Bring your son here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was still coming, the demon threw him down and convulsed [him]. Then Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the majesty of God. But while everyone marveled at all the things which Jesus did, He said to His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Let these words sink down into your ears, for the Son of Man is about to be betrayed into the hands of men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they did not understand this saying, and it was concealed from them so that they did not perceive it; and they were afraid to ask Him about this saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Then a dispute came up among them as to which of them might be greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>But Jesus, having seen the thought of their heart, taking a little child, He stood him beside Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>and said to them, "Whoever receives this little child in My name receives Me; and whoever receives Me receives Him who sent Me. For he who is least among you all shall be great."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>Now John answered and said, "Master, we saw someone casting out demons in Your name, and we forbade him because he does not follow with us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>But Jesus said to him, "Do not forbid [him], for he who is not against us is for us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>Now it came to pass, when the time had come for Him to be received up, that He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>and sent messengers before His face. And as they went, they entered a village of the Samaritans, so they might prepare for Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>But they did not receive Him, because He was determined to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when they saw this, James and John His disciples said, "Lord, do You wish [that] we should call down fire from heaven and consume them, as Elijah did?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But turning, He rebuked them, and said, "You do not know of what sort of spirit you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>For the Son of Man did not come to destroy men's lives but to save [them]."And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>Now it happened as they journeyed on the road, that someone said to Him, "Lord, I will follow You wherever You go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, "Foxes have holes and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay His head."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>Then He said to another, "Follow Me."But he said, "Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said to him, "Leave the dead to bury their own dead, but you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, "Lord, I will follow You, but first permit me to say farewell to those who are at my house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>But Jesus said to him, "No one, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.10'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.1'>Now after these things the Lord appointed seventy others also, and He sent them two by two before His face into every city and place where He Himself was about to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.2'>Then He said to them, "The harvest indeed [is] great, but the workers [are] few; therefore pray [to ]the Lord of the harvest that He may send forth workers into His harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.3'>Go; behold, I send you out as lambs in [the] midst of wolves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.4'>Do not carry a money bag, nor a knapsack, nor sandals; and greet no one along the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.5'>But whatever house you enter, first say, 'Peace to this house.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.6'>And if a son of peace is there, your peace will rest upon it; if not, it will return to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.7'>And remain in that very house, eating and drinking what they have, for the worker is worthy of his wages. Do not move from house to house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.8'>And into which ever city you enter, and they receive you, eat what is set before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.9'>And heal the sick there, and say to them, 'The kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.10'>But whatever city you enter, and they do not receive you, go out into its streets and say,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.11'>'The very dust from your city which clings to us we wipe off against you. Nevertheless know this, that the kingdom of God has drawn near to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.12'>I say to you that it will be more tolerable in that Day for Sodom than for that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.13'>"Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles which were done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.14'>Nevertheless it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the judgment than for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.15'>And you, Capernaum, who are exalted to heaven, will be brought down to Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.16'>He who hears you hears Me, he who rejects you rejects Me, and he who rejects Me rejects Him who sent Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.17'>Then the seventy returned with joy, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.18'>And He said to them, "I saw Satan having fallen like lightning out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.19'>Behold, I give you the authority to trample on serpents and scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.20'>Nevertheless do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice because your names have been written in heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.21'>In that hour Jesus rejoiced in the Spirit and said, "I praise You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent, and have revealed them to babes. Yes, Father, for so it seemed good in Your sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.22'>And turning to His disciples He said, "All things have been delivered to Me by My Father, and no one knows who the Son is except the Father, and who the Father is except the Son, and [the one] to whom the Son wills to reveal [Him]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.23'>And turning to His disciples He said privately, "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.24'>for I tell you that many prophets and kings have desired to see what you see, and they did not see [them], and to hear what you hear, and they did not hear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.25'>And behold, a certain lawyer stood up and tested Him, saying, "Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.26'>He said to him, "What is written in the law? How do you read [it]?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.27'>So he answered and said, "'You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind,' and 'your neighbor as yourself.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.28'>And He said to him, "You have answered correctly; do this and you shall live."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.29'>But he, wanting to justify himself, said to Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.30'>Then Jesus answered and said: "A certain man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and encountered bandits, who after having stripped him of his clothing and having wounded him, departed, leaving [him] half dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.31'>Now by coincidence a certain priest was coming down that road. And when he saw him, he passed by on the opposite side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.32'>Likewise a Levite, arriving at the place, came and saw, and passed by on the opposite side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.33'>But a certain Samaritan, as he traveled, came by him; and when he saw him, he was moved with compassion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.34'>And coming to him, he bandaged his wounds, pouring on oil and wine; and putting him on his own animal, he brought him to an inn, and took care of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.35'>On the next day, when he departed, he took out two denarii, and gave [them] to the innkeeper, and said to him, 'Take care of him; and whatever you spend in addition, when I come back, I will repay you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.36'>So which of these three does it seem to you proved to be a neighbor to the man who fell among the bandits?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.37'>And he said, "the [one] who showed mercy to him."Then Jesus said to him, "Go and do likewise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.38'>Now it came to pass as they traveled, that He entered into a certain village; and a certain woman named Martha welcomed Him into her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.39'>And the [woman] had a sister called Mary, who also sat at Jesus' feet and was listening to His word.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.10.41'>And Jesus answered and said to her, "Martha, Martha, you are worried and troubled about many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.10.42'>But one [thing] is needed, and Mary has chosen that good part, which shall not be taken away from her."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.11'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.11.1'>Now it came to pass, as He was praying in a certain place, when He ceased, that one of His disciples said to Him, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John also taught his disciples."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.11.53'>And as He said these things to them, the scribes and the Pharisees began to be dreadfully hostile, and to cross-examine Him about many things,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.12.1'>Now in the meantime, as an innumerable crowd had gathered together so that they were stepping on one another, He began to say to His disciples first of all, "Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, which is hypocrisy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.14.21'>So that servant came and reported these things to his master. Then the master of the house, being angry, said to his servant, 'Go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city, and bring in here the poor and the maimed and the lame and the blind.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.22'>And the servant said, 'Master, it is done as you commanded, and still there is room.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.23'>Then the master said to the servant, 'Go out into the roads and hedges, and compel [them] to come in, so that my house may be filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.24'>For I say to you that none of those men who were invited shall taste of my supper.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.25'>Now great crowds were traveling with Him. And turning, He said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.26'>If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be My disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.27'>And whoever does not bear his cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.28'>For which of you, intending to build a tower, [does] not first sit down and count up the cost, whether he has the resources to complete it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.29'>Lest perhaps after he has laid a foundation, and is not able to finish, all those who see it begin to mock him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.30'>saying, 'This man began to build and was not able to finish.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.31'>Or what king, going to engage another king in battle, [does] not sit down first and consider whether he is able with ten thousand to meet him who comes against him with twenty thousand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.32'>Otherwise, while the other is still far away, he sends a delegation and asks the [terms] for peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.14.33'>So likewise, every one of you who does not renounce all his possessions cannot be My disciple.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.15'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.1'>Now all the tax collectors and the sinners were drawing near to Him to hear Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.2'>And the Pharisees and scribes were grumbling, saying, "This man receives sinners and eats with them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.3'>And He told them this parable, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.4'>What man of you, having a hundred sheep, and loses one of them, does not leave behind the ninety-nine in the wilderness, and goes after the one having been lost until he finds it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.5'>And having found it, he puts [it] on his own shoulders, rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.6'>And coming into the house, he calls together his friends and neighbors, saying to them, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found my sheep which was lost!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.7'>I say to you that likewise [there] shall be more joy in heaven over one sinner repenting than over ninety-nine righteous who need no repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.8'>"Or what woman, having ten silver coins, if she loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house, and search carefully until she finds [it]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.9'>And when she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together, saying, 'Rejoice with me, for I have found the coin which I lost!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.10'>Just so, I say to you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of God over one sinner who repents."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.11'>Then He said: "A certain man had two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.12'>And the younger of them said to his father, 'Father, give to me the share of the wealth which falls to [me].' So he divided to them his livelihood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.13'>And not many days after, having gathered together all things, the younger son went on a journey to a distant country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.14'>But when he had spent everything, there arose a severe famine throughout that country, and he began to be in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.15'>Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country, and he sent him into his fields to feed swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.16'>And he was longing to fill his stomach with the carob pods which the swine were eating, and no one gave him anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.17'>But having come to himself, he said, 'How many of my father's hired servants have an abundance of bread, and I am perishing with hunger!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.18'>I will arise and go to my father, and I will say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.20'>And he arose and went to his father. But when he was still far off, his father saw him and was moved with compassion, and he ran and fell on his neck and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.21'>And the son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and am no longer worthy to be called your son.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.22'>But the father said to his servants, 'Bring out the best robe and put [it] on him, and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.23'>And bring the fatted calf here and slaughter it, and let us eat and be merry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.24'>for this my son was dead and came to life, and he was lost and was found.' And they began to be merry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.25'>Now his older son was in the field. And as he came and drew near to the house, he heard music and dancing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.26'>And having summoned one of the servants, he was inquiring what these things might be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.27'>And he said to him, 'Your brother has come, and because he has received him back in good health, your father has killed the fatted calf.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.15.29'>So he answered and said to his father, 'Lo, so many years I have been serving you and I never transgressed your commandment; and yet you never gave me a young goat, that I might make merry with my friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.30'>But when this son of yours came, who has devoured your livelihood with prostitutes, you slaughtered the fatted calf for him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.31'>And he said to him, 'Son, you are always with me, and all that I have is yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.15.32'>But it was necessary to be merry and to rejoice, because your brother was dead and is alive again, and was lost and is found.' "</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.16'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.1'>He also said to His disciples: "There was a certain rich man who had a manager, and this [man] was accused to him as wasting his possessions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.2'>And calling him, he said to him, 'What is this I hear about you? Render an account of your management, for you can no longer be manager.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.3'>"Then the manager said within himself, 'What shall I do? For my master is taking the management away from me. I cannot dig; I am ashamed to beg.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.4'>I know what I will do, so that whenever I am removed from the management, they will receive me into their houses.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.5'>And having summoned each one of his master's debtors to him, he said to the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.6'>And he said, 'A hundred baths of olive oil.' So he said to him, 'Take your bill, and sit down quickly and write fifty.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.8'>So the master praised the unrighteous manager because he had dealt shrewdly. For the sons of this age are shrewder in their own generation than the sons of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.9'>And I say to you, make friends for yourselves by the mammon of unrighteousness, so that whenever you fail, they may receive you into the eternal dwellings.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.13'>No servant can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.14'>Now the Pharisees, who were lovers of money, were hearing all these things, and they were mocking Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.15'>And He said to them, "You are those who justify yourselves before men, but God knows your hearts. Because that which is exalted among men is an abomination before God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.24'>Then he cried and said, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; for I am suffering in this flame.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.16.26'>And besides all this, between us and you a great gulf has been fixed, so that those who desire to cross [over ]from here to you are not able, nor may those from there cross over to us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.16.27'>Then he said, 'Therefore I beseech you, father, that you would send him to my father's house,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.13'>And the tax collector, standing far away, would not so much as lift his eyes towards heaven, but beat on his chest, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.14'>I say to you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled, and he who humbles himself shall be exalted."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.18.39'>Then those who went before warned him that he should be quiet; but he cried out all the more, "Son of David, have pity on me!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.40'>And having stopped, Jesus commanded him to be brought to Him. And when he drew near, He asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.41'>saying, "What do you desire [that] I should do for you?"And he said, "Lord, that I may receive [my] sight."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.42'>Then Jesus said to him, "Receive [your] sight; your faith has made you well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.18.43'>And immediately he received [his] sight, and was following Him, glorifying God. And all the people, when they saw [this], gave praise to God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.19'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.1'>And having entered, He passed through Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.2'>And behold, there[ was] a man named Zacchaeus, and he was a chief tax collector, and this [man] was rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.3'>And he was trying to see who Jesus was, but could not because of the crowd, for he was of short stature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.4'>And running up ahead in front, he went up into a sycamore tree so that he might see Him, because He was about to pass by that way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.5'>And when He came upon that place, Jesus looked up and saw him, and said to him, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for today I must stay in your house."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.6'>So he hurried and came down, and received Him, rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.7'>But when they saw it, they all were complaining, saying, "He has gone to be a guest with a sinful man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.8'>Then Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, "Look, Lord, I give half of my possessions to the poor; and if I have extorted anything from anyone, I restore fourfold."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.9'>And Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this house, because he also is a son of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.10'>for the Son of Man has come to seek and to save that which was lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.11'>Now as they heard these things, He told another parable, because He was near Jerusalem and because they thought the kingdom of God would appear immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.12'>Therefore He said: "A certain nobleman went into a far country to receive for himself a kingdom and to return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.13'>And having called ten of his servants, he gave them ten minas, and said to them, 'Do business till I come.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.14'>But his citizens hated him, and sent a delegation after him, saying, 'We will not have this man to reign over us.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.15'>And so it was that when he returned, having received the kingdom, that he commanded those servants to whom he had given the money, to be called to him, so that he might know who gained what by trading.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.16'>Then came the first, saying, 'Master, your mina has earned ten minas.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.17'>And he said to him, 'Well [done], good servant; because you were faithful in a very little, have authority over ten cities.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.18'>And the second came, saying, 'Master, your mina made five minas.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.19'>Likewise he said to him, 'You also be over five cities.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.20'>Then another came, saying, 'Master, behold your mina, which I had laid away in a handkerchief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.21'>For I feared you, because you are a harsh man. You take up what you did not deposit, and reap what you did not sow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.22'>And he said to him, 'Out of your own mouth I will judge you, you wicked servant. You knew that I was a harsh man, taking up what I did not deposit, and reaping what I did not sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.23'>Why then did you not give my money to a bank, and when I came, I would have collected it with interest?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.24'>And he said to those standing by, 'Take the mina away from him, and give it to him who has ten minas.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.25'>"But they said to him, 'Master, he has ten minas.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.26'>For I say to you that to everyone who has, [more] shall be given; and from him who does not have, even what he has shall be taken away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.27'>Nevertheless bring here those enemies of mine, who did not want me to reign over them, and slay [them] before me.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.28'>And having said these things, He went on ahead, going up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.29'>And it came to pass, as He drew near to Bethsphage and Bethany, to the mountain which is called Olivet, that He sent two of His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.30'>saying, "Go into the village opposite you, in which when you enter you will find a colt tied up, on which no one of men has ever sat. Loose him and bring [him] [here].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.31'>And if anyone asks you, 'Why are you loosing [him]?' thus you shall say to him, 'Because the Lord has need of him.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.32'>So those who were sent departed and found it just as He told them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.33'>But as they were loosing the colt, the owners of it said to them, "Why are you loosing the colt?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.34'>And they said, "The Lord has need of him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.35'>Then they brought him to Jesus. And when they threw their own clothes on the colt, they set Jesus on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.36'>And as He went, they were spreading their clothes under [Him] on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.37'>And as He was approaching the descent of the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to rejoice and praise God with a loud voice for all the miracles which they had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.38'>saying: "'Blessed is the King who comes in the name of the LORD!' Peace in heaven and glory in the highest! "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.39'>And some of the Pharisees said to Him from the crowd, "Teacher, rebuke Your disciples."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.40'>But He answered and said to them, "I tell you that if these should keep silent, the stones would immediately cry out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.41'>And as He drew near, seeing the city, He wept over it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.42'>saying, "If you had known, even you, especially in this your day, the things pertaining to your peace! But now they have been hidden from your eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.43'>For days will come upon you when your enemies will build an embankment around you, surround you and hem you in from every side,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.44'>and they will level you to the ground, and your children with you; and they will not leave in you one stone upon another, because you did not know the season of your visitation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.45'>And when He entered into the temple, He began to drive out those buying and selling in it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.46'>saying to them, "It is written, 'My house is a house of prayer,' but you have made it a 'den of thieves.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.47'>And He was teaching daily in the temple. But the chief priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people were seeking to destroy Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.19.48'>and were unable to do anything; for all the people were very attentive to hear Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>Now it came to pass on one of those days, as He taught the people in the temple and preached the gospel, that the priests and the scribes, together with the elders, confronted Him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and they spoke to Him, saying, "Tell us, by what authority are You doing these things? Or who is he who gave You this authority?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>But He answered and said to them, "I also will ask you one thing, and so tell Me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>The baptism of John-was it from heaven or from men?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they debated among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' He will say, 'Why [then] did you not believe him?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, 'From men,' all the people will stone us, for they are persuaded [that] John was a prophet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>So they answered that they did not know where it was from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said to them, "Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then He began to tell the people this parable: "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to farmers, and went on a journey for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>Now at vintage-time he sent a servant to the farmers, that they might give him some of the fruit of the vineyard. But the farmers flogged him and sent him away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And again he sent another servant; and they flogged him also, treated him shamefully, and sent [him] away empty-handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And again he sent a third; and they wounded him also and threw [him] out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What shall I do? I will send my beloved son. Perhaps when they see him they will respect [him].'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the farmers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, so that the inheritance may be ours.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And casting him out of the vineyard, they killed him. What then will the owner of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others."And when they heard it they said, "May it never be!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>Then He looked at them and said, "What then is this which is written: 'The stone which the builders rejected Has become the chief cornerstone'?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>"Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it will grind him to powder."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the chief priests and the scribes sought to lay hands on Him that very hour, but they were afraid-for they knew that He had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And having watched [Him] closely, they sent spies who pretended to be righteous, that they might seize on His words, in order to deliver Him to the rule and the authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>Then they asked Him, saying, "Teacher, we know that You say and teach rightly, and You do not show favoritism, but teach the way of God in truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But perceiving their craftiness, He said to them, "Why do you test Me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Show Me a denarius. Whose image and inscription does it have?"They answered and said, "Caesar's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>And He said to them, "Render therefore to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>But they could not catch Him in His words in front of the people. And marveling at His answer, they kept silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Then some of the Sadducees, those who deny that there is a resurrection, coming to Him and asked Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying: "Teacher, Moses wrote to us that if a man's brother dies, having a wife, and this [man ]dies childless, that his brother should take his wife and raise up offspring for his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Now there were seven brothers. And the first, having taken a wife, died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And the second took her as wife, and this [man ]died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>Then the third took her, and in like manner the seven also; and they left no children, and they died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore, in the resurrection, whose wife does she become? For all seven had her [as] wife."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answered and said to them, "The sons of this age marry and are given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But those who have been counted worthy to attain that age, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry nor are given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>nor can they die anymore, for they are equal to the angels and are sons of God, being sons of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Now even Moses revealed that the dead are raised, in [the passage about] the [burning ]bush, when he called the Lord 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>"For He is not the God of the dead but of the living, for all are alive to Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then some of the scribes answered and said, "Teacher, You have spoken well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>But after that they dared not question Him anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And He said to them, "How [is it that] they say the Christ is the Son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>Even David himself said in the Book of Psalms, 'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>"Therefore David calls Him 'Lord'; how is He then his Son?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>And as all the people listened, He said to His disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk about in long robes, and love greetings in the marketplaces, and the first seats in the synagogues, and the places of honor at dinners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>who devour widows' houses, and for a show make long prayers. These will receive greater condemnation."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>And looking up, He saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>and He saw also a certain poor widow putting in two mites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>And He said, "Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put [in] more than all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>For all these out of their abundance have put in offerings for God, but she out of her poverty put [in] all the livelihood which she had."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>Then, as some spoke about the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones and donations, He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>These things which you see-the days will come in which not one stone shall be left upon another that shall not be thrown down."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>So they asked Him, saying, "Teacher, when therefore will these things be? And what [will be ]the sign when these things are about to happen?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>And He said: "Take heed that you not be deceived. For many will come in My name, saying, 'I AM,' and, 'The time has drawn near.' Therefore do not go after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>But whenever you hear of wars and insurrections, do not be terrified; for these things must happen first, but the end will not come immediately."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>Then He said to them, "Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>And there will be great earthquakes in various places, and famines and pestilences; and there will be fearful events and great signs from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.12'>But before all these things, they will lay their hands on you and they will persecute you, delivering you up to the synagogues and prisons. You will be brought before kings and rulers on account of My name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.13'>But it shall turn out for you for a testimony.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.17'>And you will be hated by all [people ]for My name's sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.18'>But not a hair of your head shall by any means perish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.21.36'>Watch therefore, praying always that you may be counted worthy to escape everything that is about to happen, and to stand before the Son of Man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.37'>And in the daytime He was teaching in the temple, but at night He went out and stayed on the mountain called Olivet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Then came the Day of Unleavened Bread, when the Pascal Lamb must be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>And He sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and prepare the Passover for us, so that we may eat [it]."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>Then they began to discuss with one another, which of them might be the [one] who was about to do this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>And there became also a dispute among them, [as to] which of them seemed to be greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>But He said to them, "The kings of the Gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called 'benefactors.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>But you [shall ]not [be] thus; but let the greatest among you, let him be as the youngest, and he who leads as he who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>For who is greater, he who sits at the table, or he who serves? Is it not he who sits at the table? Yet I am among you as the One who serves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>Now you are those who have remained with Me in My trials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I bestow upon you a kingdom, just as My Father bestowed one upon Me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>so that you may eat and drink at My table in My kingdom, and you will sit on thrones judging the twelve tribes of Israel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>And the Lord said, "Simon, Simon! Behold, Satan has asked for you, that he may sift you as wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>But I have prayed for you, that your faith should not fail; and when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>But he said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You, both to prison and to death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>Then He said, "I say to you, Peter, the rooster will by no means crow this day before you will deny three times that you know Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>And He said to them, "When I sent you without a money bag, and a knapsack, and sandals, did you lack anything?"And they said, "Nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>Then He said to them, "But now, he who has a money bag, let him take it, and likewise also a knapsack; and he who has no sword shall sell his garment and buy one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>For I say to you that this which has been written must still be accomplished in Me-the [saying,] 'And He was numbered with the transgressors.' For the things concerning Me have a fulfillment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>So they said, "Lord, look, here are two swords."And He said to them, "It is enough."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>And going out, He went to the Mount of Olives, according to His custom, and His disciples also followed Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>And having come to the place, He said to them, "Pray that you may not enter into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And He was withdrawn from them about a stone's throw, and He knelt down and prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>saying, "Father, if You will, remove this cup from Me-nevertheless not My will, but Yours, be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Then an angel appeared to Him from heaven, strengthening Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in agony, He prayed more fervently. Then His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down onto the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>And rising up from prayer, coming to the disciples, He found them sleeping from sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>Then He said to them, "Why do you sleep? Rise up and pray, lest you enter into temptation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>And while He was still speaking, behold, a crowd; and he who was called Judas, one of the twelve, was going before them and drew near to Jesus to kiss Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>But Jesus said to him, "Judas, do you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>And those around Him, seeing what was about to happen, they said to Him, "Lord, shall we strike with the sword?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And a certain one of them struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>But Jesus answered and said, "Stop right there."And touching his ear, He healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Then Jesus said to the chief priests, captains of the temple, and the elders who had come to Him, "Have you come out, as against a bandit, with swords and clubs?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>When I was with you daily in the temple, you did not try to seize Me. But this is your hour, and the power of darkness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>And having arrested Him, they led Him and brought Him into the house of the high priest. And Peter was following from a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>Now when they had lit a fire in the midst of the courtyard and sat down together, Peter sat in their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>And a certain servant girl, seeing him sitting at the fire and gazing at him, said, "This [man] was also with Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>But he denied Him, saying, "Woman, I do not know Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And after a little [while] another [person ]saw him and said, "You also are [one ]of them."But Peter said, "Man, I am not!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>Then after about one hour had passed, another was firmly insisting, saying, "Surely this fellow also was with Him, for he is a Galilean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>But Peter said, "Man, I do not know what you are saying!"And immediately, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word of the Lord, how He had said to him, "Before a rooster crows, you will deny Me three times."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And going outside, Peter wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>Now the men who were holding Jesus were mocking Him and beating [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>And having blindfolded Him, they were striking His face and asking Him, saying, "Prophesy! Who is the one who struck You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And many other things they blasphemously spoke against Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>And when it became day, the council of the elders of the people, the chief priests and scribes, came together and led Him into their council, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>"If You are the Messiah, tell us."But He said to them, "If I tell you, you will by no means believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>But if I also question you, you will by no means answer Me or release [Me].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>Hereafter the Son of Man will sit on the right hand of the power of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>Then they all said, "Are You then the Son of God?"So He said to them, "You [rightly] say that I am."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>And they said, "What further testimony do we need? For we have heard it ourselves from His own mouth!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>Then the whole multitude of them arose and led Him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse Him, saying, "We found this [Man] perverting the nation, and forbidding to pay taxes to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ, a King."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>Then Pilate questioned Him, saying, "Are You the King of the Jews?"He answered him and said, "You are saying [what is] [so]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>But Pilate said to the chief priests and the crowds, "I find no guilt in this Man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>But they insisted, saying, "He stirs up the people, teaching throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee to here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked if the Man were a Galilean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And when he found out that He belonged to Herod's jurisdiction, he sent Him to Herod, who was also in Jerusalem in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>Now when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceedingly glad; for he had desired for a long time to see Him, because he had heard many things about Him, and he was hoping to see some miracle being done by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>Then he questioned Him with many words, but He answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and scribes stood, vehemently accusing Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Then Herod, with his men of war, having treated Him with contempt, and having mocked Him, arrayed Him in a gorgeous robe, and sent Him back to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>That very day Pilate and Herod became friends with each other, for previously they had been at enmity with each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilate, having called together the chief priests, the rulers, and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said to them, "You have brought this Man to me, on the charge of misleading the people. And indeed, when I examined Him in your presence, I found no guilt in this Man in the matters which you bring as charges against Him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>and neither [did] Herod, for I sent you back to him; and indeed nothing worthy of death has been done by Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>Therefore when I have flogged Him, I will release [Him.]"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>(for it was necessary for him to release one to them at the feast).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>But they all cried out together, saying, "Away with this [Man], and release to us Barabbas"-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>who because of a certain insurrection having occurred in the city had been thrown into prison, and for murder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate, therefore, wishing to release Jesus, again called out to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>Then he said to them the third [time], "Why, what evil did He do? I have found no guilt deserving death in Him. Therefore when I have flogged Him, I will release [Him]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>But they were insistent, demanding with loud voices that He be crucified. And their voices and [those] of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>So Pilate decided [that] their request should be carried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released whom they were requesting, who because of insurrection and murder had been thrown into prison; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led Him away, they laid hold of a certain man, Simon a Cyrenian, [as he was] coming from the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might carry it behind Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And a great multitude of the people followed Him, and women who also were mourning and lamenting Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus, turning to them, said, "Daughters of Jerusalem, do not weep for Me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For behold, the days are coming in which they will say, 'Blessed [are] the barren, and [the] wombs which did not give birth, and breasts which did not nurse!'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin 'to say to the mountains, "Fall on us!"and to the hills, "Cover us!"'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in the green tree, what will happen in the dry?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And they also were leading two others with Him, evildoers, to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place which is called Calvary, there they crucified Him and the evildoers, one on the right, and one on the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Then Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."And dividing His garments, they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood, observing. And the rulers with them also were sneering, saying, "He saved others; let Him save Himself if He is the Christ, the elect of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>The soldiers also mocked Him, coming and offering Him sour wine,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying, "If You are the King of the Jews, save Yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And an inscription also was written over Him, in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew letters: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>Then one of the evildoers who were hanged blasphemed Him, saying, "If You are the Christ, save Yourself and us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other, answering, rebuked him, saying, "Do you not even fear God, seeing you are under the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly, for we are receiving the due reward of our deeds; but this Man did nothing wrong."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>Then he said to Jesus, "Lord, remember me when You come in Your kingdom."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, "Assuredly I say to you, today you shall be with Me in Paradise."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>Now it was about the sixth hour, and darkness came upon the whole land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>Then the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, "Father, 'into Your hands I will commit My spirit.' "And after He said these things, He expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>And when the centurion saw what had happened, he glorified God, saying, "Certainly this was a righteous Man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the crowds which came together for this spectacle, when they saw what had happened, beat their own chests and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>But all His acquaintances, and the women who followed Him from Galilee, stood at a distance, watching these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And behold, there was a man named Joseph, a council member, a good and just man</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(this [man] had not agreed to their decision and deed), from Arimathea, a city of the Jews, who himself was also waiting for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And having taken it down, he wrapped it in a linen cloth, and put it in a tomb cut out of rock, where no one had ever lain before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>That day was the Preparation; the Sabbath was drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women who had come with Him from Galilee followed after, and they observed the tomb and how His body was placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Then they returned and prepared spices and perfumes. And they rested on the Sabbath, according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>And on the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they, and certain other women with them, came to the tomb bringing the spices which they had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>But they found the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And going in they did not find the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it happened, as they were greatly perplexed about this, that behold, two men stood by them in dazzling apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>Then, as they became afraid and bowed their faces to the ground, they said to them, "Why do you seek the living among the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen! Remember how He spoke to you when He was still in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying, 'The Son of Man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise again.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered His words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And returning from the tomb, they reported all these things to the eleven and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary [the mother] of James, and the rest with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed like nonsense before them, and they disbelieved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>But Peter rose up and ran to the tomb; and stooping down, he saw the linen strips lying by themselves; and he departed, marveling to himself at what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>Now behold, two of them were traveling that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was about seven miles from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they were conversing with one another about all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>So it was, as they were conversing and discussing, that Jesus Himself drew near and started to travel with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were restrained, so that they did not recognize Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And He said to them, "What [are ]these words which you are exchanging with one another as you walk, and you have a gloomy look?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>Then the one whose name was Cleopas answered and said to Him, "Are You the only stranger in Jerusalem, and do not know what has happened in it in these days?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And He said to them, "What things?"So they said to Him, "The things concerning Jesus the Nazarene, who proved to be a man [who was ]a Prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>and how the chief priests and our rulers handed Him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we were hoping that it was He who was going to redeem Israel. Indeed, besides all this, today is the third day since these things happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Moreover certain women of our group astonished us, after they arrived early at the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And not finding His body, they came saying that they had also seen a vision of angels who said He was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And certain of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it thus just as also the women had said; but Him they did not see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then He said to them, "O [you ]foolish, and slow of heart to believe in all that the prophets have spoken!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not the Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into His glory?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the Prophets, He expounded to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>Then they drew near to the village where they were going, and He made as though He was going farther.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained Him, saying, "Stay with us, for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent."And He went in to stay with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>Now it came to pass, as He was reclining [to eat] with them, having taken bread, He blessed and broke it, and He gave [it] to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Then their eyes were opened and they recognized Him; and He vanished from their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to one another, "Was not our heart burning within us while He was speaking to us on the road, and while He was interpreting the Scriptures to us?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>So they rose up that very hour and returned to Jerusalem, and they found the eleven and those who were with them gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and has appeared to Simon!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they described the things that had happened on the road, and how He was known to them in the breaking of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>Now as they said these things, Jesus Himself stood in the midst of them, and said to them, "Peace to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But being alarmed and becoming fearful, they thought they saw a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And He said to them, "Why are you troubled? And why do doubts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself. Handle Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see I have."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>When He had said this, He showed them His hands and His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>But as they still disbelieved for joy, and marveled, He said to them, "Do you have any food here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>So they gave Him a piece of a broiled fish and some honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And taking it, He ate [it ]in their presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>Then He said to them, "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all things must be fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and the Psalms concerning Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>And He opened their understanding, that they might comprehend the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>Then He said to them, "Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>and that repentance and forgiveness of sins should be preached in His name to all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And you are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And behold, I am sending the Promise of My Father upon you; but tarry in the city of Jerusalem until you are endued with power from on high."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And He led them out as far as Bethany, and lifting up His hands, He blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it happened, while He blessed them, that He was parted from them and was carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And after they had worshipped Him, they returned to Jerusalem with great joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>and they were continually in the temple praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things came to be through Him, and without Him nothing came to be which has come to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not apprehend it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man sent from God, whose name [was] John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>This [man] came for a testimony, so that he might testify concerning the Light, so that all through him might believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not that Light, but [was sent] so that he might testify concerning the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>That was the true Light which lightens every man coming into the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to His own, and His own did not receive Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received Him, He gave them the authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld His glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John testified concerning Him and has cried out, saying, "This was He of whom I said, 'He who comes after me, has come to be before me, because He was before me.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And out of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses, but grace and truth came to be through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, He who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared [Him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the testimony of John, when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, "Who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>He confessed, and did not deny, but confessed, "I am not the Messiah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, "What then? Are you Elijah?"He said, "I am not.""Are you the Prophet?"And he answered, "No."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said: "I am 'The voice of one crying in the wilderness: "Make straight the way of the LORD,"' just as Isaiah the prophet said."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>Now those who had been sent were from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, saying, "Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ, nor Elijah, nor the Prophet?"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>He is the [One ]who comes after me, who has come to be before me, of whom I am not worthy that I should loose the strap of His sandal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things happened in Bethany, beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>The next day he saw Jesus coming toward him, and said, "Behold! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is the [One] about whom I said, 'After me comes a Man who ranks before me, because He was before me.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize with water said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding on Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>"And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again, the next day, John stood with two of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>And looking at Jesus as He [was] walking, he said, "Behold the Lamb of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>The two disciples heard him speaking, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>Then Jesus turned and observed them following, and said to them, "What are you seeking?"They said to Him, "Rabbi"(which is translated, Teacher), "where are You staying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He said to them, "Come and see."They came and saw where He was staying, and they stayed with Him that day. It was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two who heard John speak, and followed Him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He first found his own brother Simon, and said to him, "We have found the Messiah"(which is translated, the Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>And he led him to Jesus. Now when Jesus looked at him, He said, "You are Simon the son of Jonah. You shall be called Cephas"(which is translated, A Stone).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the next day He wanted to go to Galilee, and He found Philip and said to him, "Follow Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip found Nathanael and said to him, "We have found the [One] about whom Moses wrote in the Law, and the Prophets-Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said to him, "Can anything good come out of Nazareth?"Philip said to him, "Come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming toward Him, and said about him, "Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael said to Him, "From where do You know me?"Jesus answered and said to him, "Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to Him, "Rabbi, You are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said to him, "Because I said to you, 'I saw you under the fig tree,' do you believe? You will see greater things than these."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And He said to him, "Most assuredly I say to you, from now on you shall see heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And on the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>Now when the head steward tasted the water which had become wine, and did not know where it came from (but the servants who had drawn the water knew), the head steward called the bridegroom</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, "Every man first sets out the good wine, and when they have well drunk, then the inferior. You have kept the good wine until now!"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And having made a scourge out of cords, He drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and the oxen, and He poured out the coins of the moneychangers, and He overturned the tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And He said to those selling the doves, "Take these things [away] from here! Do not make My Father's house a house of merchandise!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>Then His disciples remembered that it was written, "The zeal for Your house will consume Me."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>He left Judea and went away into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>But He needed to pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>Therefore He came to a city of Samaria, which is called Sychar, near the piece of land which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>Now Jacob's well was there. Therefore Jesus, having become tired from the journey, was sitting thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>A woman of Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, "Give Me a drink."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>Now after the two days He went out from there and went to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus Himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>And already as he was going, his servants met him and reported, saying, "Your child lives!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>Then he inquired from them the hour at which he got better. And they said to him, "Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>Therefore the father knew that it was at the same hour in which Jesus said to him, "Your son lives."And he himself believed, and his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This again is the second sign Jesus did, after He had come out of Judea into Galilee.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem by the Sheep [Gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew, Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these [porches] were lying a great multitude of those who were sick, blind, lame, paralyzed, waiting for the moving of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel from time to[ ]time descended into the pool and stirred up the water; therefore the first [one] having gone in after the stirring up of the water, became well of whatever disease he was suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>Now there was a certain man there who had an ailment [for ]thirty-eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw this [man] lying there, and knew that he already had been in [that condition] a long time, He said to him, "Do you wish to become well?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man answered Him, "Sir, I do not have a man, so that whenever the water is stirred up, he may put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another descends before me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus said to him, "Arise, take up your bed and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And immediately the man became well, and took up his bed, and began to walk. And that day was the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>Therefore the Jews said to the man who was healed, "It is the Sabbath; it is not lawful for you to carry your bed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>He answered them, "He that made me whole, He said to me, 'Take up your bed and walk.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>Then they asked him, "Who is the Man who said to you, 'Take up your bed and walk'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But the one who was healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had turned aside, while a crowd was in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After these things Jesus found him in the temple, and said to him, "See, you have become well. Sin no more, lest something worse may happen to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away and reported to the Jews that Jesus was the [One ]who had made him well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And on account of this the Jews began to persecute Jesus, and were seeking to kill Him, because He was doing these things on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and I am working."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>Because of this the Jews were seeking all the more to kill Him, because not only was He breaking the Sabbath, but also He called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Then Jesus answered and said to them, "Most assuredly I say to you, the Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father doing; for whatever He does, the Son also does in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loves the Son, and shows to Him all things which He Himself does; and greater works than these He will show Him, so that you may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raises up the dead and gives life, thus also the Son gives life to whom He wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judges no one, but He has given all judgment to the Son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>so that all may honor the Son even as they honor the Father. He who does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>"Most assuredly I say to you, he who hears My word and believes in Him who sent Me has everlasting life, and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Most assuredly I say to you, that an hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God; and those having heard shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For just as the Father has life in Himself, so He has granted the Son to have life in Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and has given Him authority to execute judgment also, because He is [the] Son of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Do not marvel at this; for an hour is coming in which all those in the tombs will hear His voice</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall come forth-those who have done good, to a resurrection of life, and those who have done evil, to a resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can of My own self do nothing. Even as I hear, I judge; and My judgment is just, because I do not seek My own will but the will of the Father who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>"If I testify of Myself, My testimony is not valid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>There is another who testifies about Me, and I know that the testimony which He testifies concerning Me is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I do not receive the testimony from man, but these things I say so that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was the burning and shining lamp, and you were willing to rejoice for a while in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a testimony greater than John's; for the works which the Father gave to Me, that I should complete them, these very works which I do, testify of Me, that the Father has sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father Himself, who sent Me, has testified about Me. You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His form.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>But you do not have His word abiding in you, because [Him ]whom He sent, Him you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>You search the Scriptures, because you think [that] in them you have eternal life; and these are they which testify about Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>But you are unwilling to come to Me, so that you may have life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I do not receive glory from men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I have known you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in My Father's name, and you do not receive Me; if another comes in his own name, him you will receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>How can you believe, who receive glory from one another, and do not seek the glory which is from the only God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father; there is one who accuses you-Moses, in whom you have hoped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if you believed Moses, you would have believed Me; for he wrote about Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if you do not believe his writings, how will you believe My words?"</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.6'>
        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>After these things Jesus went over the Sea of Galilee, that is, of Tiberias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>And a large crowd was following Him, because they were seeing His signs which He was doing upon those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up on the mountain, and there He sat down with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the Passover, the feast of the Jews, was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Then Jesus lifted up His eyes, and seeing that a large crowd was coming toward Him, He said to Philip, "Where shall we buy bread, that these [people ]may eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But this He said to test him, for He Himself knew what He was about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered Him, "Two hundred denarii [worth of] bread is not enough for them, that each of them might receive a little."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of His disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, said to Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish, but what are they for so many?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Then Jesus said, "Make the people to recline."Now there was much grass in that place. Therefore the men reclined, in number about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks He distributed them to the disciples, and the disciples to those who were reclining; and likewise of the fish, as much as they wished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>But when they were filled, He said to His disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments, so that nothing may be lost."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>Therefore they gathered [them] up, and they filled twelve baskets of fragments from the five barley loaves which were left over by those who had eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>Then those men, when they had seen the sign that Jesus did, said, "This is truly the Prophet who is to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>Therefore Jesus, knowing that they were about to come and seize Him, that they might make Him king, withdrew to the mountain by Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>Now when evening came, His disciples went down to the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>and having entered into the boat, they were going across the sea to Capernaum. And darkness had already come, and Jesus had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>And the sea was agitated by a great blowing wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>Therefore having rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea and drawing near to the boat; and they were frightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But He said to them, "[It is] I AM; do not fear."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>Then they were willing to receive Him into the boat, and immediately the boat arrived at the land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>On the next day, when the crowd which had remained on the other side of the sea, having seen that there was no other boat there, except that one in which His disciples had entered, and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with His disciples, but His disciples had gone away alone-</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>however, other boats came from Tiberias, near the place where they ate bread after the Lord had given thanks-</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>when the crowd therefore saw that Jesus was not there, nor His disciples, they got into boats and came to Capernaum, seeking Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>And having found Him on the other side of the sea, they said to Him, "Rabbi, when did You come here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jesus answered them and said, "Most assuredly I say to you, you seek Me, not because you saw the signs, but because you ate from the loaves and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give to you; for [upon] Him God the Father has set [His] seal."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>Then they said to Him, "What should we do, that we may work the works of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jesus answered and said to them, "This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He sent."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>Therefore they said to Him, "What sign will You do then, so that we may see it and believe You? What work do You perform?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness; as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Then Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread from heaven, but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.34'>Then they said to Him, "Lord, give us this bread always."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.35'>And Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. He who comes to Me shall never hunger, and he who believes in Me shall never thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.36'>But I told you that you have both seen Me and you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.37'>All that the Father gives Me shall come to Me, and the one who comes to Me I will by no means cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.38'>For I have come down from heaven, not that I might do My will, but the will of Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.39'>And this is the will of the Father who sent Me, that of all He has given Me, I should lose nothing, but should raise it up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.40'>And this is the will of Him who sent Me, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him may have eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.41'>Therefore the Jews were murmuring about Him, because He said, "I am the bread which came down from heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.42'>And they were saying, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does this [Man] say, 'I have come down from heaven'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.43'>Jesus therefore answered and said to them, "Do not murmur among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.44'>No one can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me should draw him; and I will raise him up at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.45'>It is written in the prophets, 'And they shall all be taught of God.' Therefore everyone who hears from the Father, and has learned, comes to Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.46'>Not that anyone has seen the Father, except He who is from God; He has seen the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.47'>Most assuredly I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.48'>I am the bread of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.49'>Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.50'>This is the bread which comes down from heaven, that one may eat of it and not die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.51'>I am the living bread which came down from heaven. If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever; and the bread that I shall give is My flesh, which I shall give for the life of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.52'>Therefore the Jews were contending with one another, saying, "How can this Man give us His flesh to eat?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.53'>Then Jesus said to them, "Most assuredly, I say to you, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.54'>Whoever eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.55'>For My flesh truly is food, and My blood truly is drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.56'>He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood abides in Me, and I in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.57'>Just as the living Father sent Me, and I live because of the Father, so he who feeds on Me will live because of Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.58'>This is the bread which came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate the manna, and died. He that eats this bread shall live forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.59'>These things He said in the synagogue as He taught in Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.60'>Therefore many of His disciples, when they heard this, said, "This is a hard saying; who can hear it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.61'>And Jesus, knowing in Himself that His disciples were murmuring about this, He said to them, "Does this offend you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.62'>What then if you should see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.63'>It is the Spirit who makes alive; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I speak to you are spirit, and they are life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.64'>But there are some of you who do not believe."For Jesus knew from the beginning who were the ones who did not believe, and who was the one who would betray Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.65'>And He said, "Because of this I have said to you that no one can come to Me unless it has been granted to him by My Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.66'>From this [time] many of His disciples turned back and no longer would walk with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.67'>Then Jesus said to the twelve, "Do you also want to go away?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.68'>But Simon Peter answered Him, "Lord, to whom shall we go? You have the words of eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.69'>Also we have come to believe and know that You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.70'>He answered them, "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.71'>Now He was speaking [about] Judas Iscariot, [the son] of Simon, for he was intending to betray Him, though he was one of the twelve.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.7'>
        <verse osisID='John.7.1'>And after these things Jesus was walking in Galilee; for He did not wish to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.2'>Now the Jewish Feast of Tabernacles was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.3'>His brothers therefore said to Him, "Depart from here and go into Judea, so that Your disciples also may see the works that You do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.4'>For no one does anything in secret while he himself seeks to be known publicly. If You do these things, show Yourself to the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.5'>For not even His brothers believed in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.6'>Then Jesus said to them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always ready.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.7'>The world cannot hate you, but it hates Me because I testify about it, that its works are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.8'>You go up to this feast. I am not yet going up to this feast, because My time has not yet been fulfilled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.9'>When He had said these things to them, He remained in Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.10'>But when His brothers had gone up, then also He Himself went up to the feast, not openly, but as [it were] in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.11'>Then the Jews were seeking Him at the feast, and said, "Where is He?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.12'>And there was much murmuring among the crowds concerning Him. Some on the one hand were saying, "He is a good [Man]"; [while ]others were saying, "No, on the contrary, He deceives the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.13'>However, no one spoke openly of Him for fear of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.14'>But now about the middle of the feast Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.15'>And the Jews were marveling, saying, "How is this Man learned, since He has not been educated?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.16'>Therefore Jesus answered them and said, "My doctrine is not Mine, but His who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.17'>If anyone desires to do His will, he will know about the doctrine, whether it is from God, or whether I am speaking on My own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.18'>He who speaks from himself is seeking his own glory; but He who seeks the glory of the One who sent Him is true, and no unrighteousness is in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.19'>Has not Moses given you the law, yet none of you keeps the law? Why are you seeking to kill Me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.20'>The crowd answered and said, "You have a demon. Who is seeking to kill You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.21'>Jesus answered and said to them, "I did one work, and [you] all marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.22'>Because of this Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and you circumcise a man on [the] Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.23'>If a man receives circumcision on [the] Sabbath, so that the law of Moses should not be broken, are you angry with Me because I made a man completely well on [the] Sabbath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.24'>Do not judge according to appearance, but judge with righteous judgment."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.25'>Therefore some of people of Jerusalem were saying, "Is this not He whom they are seeking to kill?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.26'>And look! He is speaking publicly, and they say nothing to Him. Can it be that the rulers know indeed that this is truly the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.27'>However, we know where this Man is from; but when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.28'>Therefore Jesus cried out, as He was teaching in the temple, saying, "You both know Me, and you know where I am from; and I have not come on my own, but He who sent Me is true, whom you do not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.29'>I know Him, for I am from Him, and He sent Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.30'>Therefore they were seeking to arrest Him; but no one laid a hand on Him, because His hour had not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.31'>But many of the crowd believed in Him, and were saying, "When the Christ comes, will He do more signs than these which this [Man] did?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.32'>The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about Him, and the Pharisees and the chief priests sent attendants so that they might arrest Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.33'>Then Jesus said, "Yet a little while am I with you, and [then] I go to Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.34'>You will seek Me and you will not find [Me], and where I am you cannot come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.35'>Therefore the Jews said among themselves, "Where does this [man] intend to go that we will not find Him? Does He intend to go into the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.36'>What is this thing which He said, 'You will seek Me and you will not find [Me], and where I am you cannot come'?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.37'>Now on the last day, the great [day] of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, "If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.7.38'>He that believes in Me, as the Scripture has said, out of his belly will flow rivers of living water."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>Therefore when He heard that he was sick, He then stayed in the place where He was [for ]two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this He said to the disciples, "Let us go into Judea again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples said to Him, "Rabbi, [just] now the Jews were seeking to stone You, and are You going there again?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, "Are there not twelve hours in the day? If anyone walks in the day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if anyone walks in the night, he stumbles, because the light is not in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things He said, and after this He said to them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may awaken him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>Then His disciples said, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep he will get well."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>However, Jesus spoke about his death, but they thought that He was speaking about resting in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I rejoice for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. Nevertheless let us go to him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Then Thomas, who is called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let us also go, so that we may die with Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>Therefore when He had come, Jesus found that he had already been in the tomb four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jews had come to the [women] around Martha and Mary, so that they might console them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Then Martha, when she heard that Jesus was coming, met Him, but Mary was sitting in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Then Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even now I know that whatever You may ask of God, God will give You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha said to Him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection in the last day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. He that believes in Me, though he may die, he shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And everyone who lives and believes in Me shall never die. Do you believe this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She said to Him, "Yes, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ, the Son of God, who is to come into the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said these things, she went out and secretly called Mary her sister, saying, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>As soon as she heard [that], she arose quickly and came to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>Now Jesus had not yet come into the village, but was in the place where Martha met Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>Then the Jews who were with her in the house and consoling her, when they saw that Mary rose up quickly and went out, followed her, saying, "She is going to the tomb, so that she may weep there."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Then, when Mary came where Jesus was, seeing Him, she fell down at His feet, saying to Him, "Lord, if You had been here, my brother would not have died."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>Therefore, when Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews who had come along with her weeping, He groaned in the spirit and was troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>And He said, "Where have you laid him?"They said to Him, "Lord, come and see."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>Therefore the Jews were saying, "Look how He loved him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, "Could not this Man, who opened the eyes of the blind, have done [something] to keep this man from dying?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Then Jesus, again groaning in Himself, came to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone was lying upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus said, "Take away the stone."Martha, the sister of the [one] having died, said to Him, "Lord, already there is a stench, for he has been dead four days."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>Then they took away the stone from the place where the dead man was lying. And Jesus lifted up His eyes and said, "Father, I thank You that You have heard Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I knew that You always hear Me, but because of the people standing around I said [this], so that they may believe that You sent Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And having said these things, He cried out with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come forth!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And the [one] having died came out, bound hands and feet with grave clothes, and his face was wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus said to them, "Loose him, and let [him] go."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Therefore many of the Jews who had come to Mary, and seeing the things which Jesus had done, believed in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>Therefore the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered a council and said, "What are we doing? For this Man works many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we leave Him alone in this way, all will believe in Him, and the Romans will come and will take away both our place and nation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, "You don't know anything,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do you consider that it is advantageous for us that one man should die for the people, and not that the whole nation should perish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>Now this he did not say on his own, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was about to die for the nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for that nation only, but also that He would gather together in one the children of God who were scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>Therefore from that day [on] they took counsel together, that they might kill Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Therefore Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but He went away from there into the country near the desert, to a city called Ephraim, and there He stayed with His disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>And the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went from the country up to Jerusalem before the Passover, so that they might purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>Then they were seeking Jesus, and they were speaking with one another, standing in the temple, "What do you think-that He will definitely not come to the feast?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now both the chief priests and the Pharisees had given a command, that if anyone knew where He was, he should report [it], so that they might seize Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Then Jesus, six days before the Passover, came to Bethany, where Lazarus was who had died, whom He raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>Then they made for Him a supper there; and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of those reclining [to eat] with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Then Mary, having taken a pound of very costly pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair. And the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfume.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>Then one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, [son ]of Simon, who was about to betray Him, said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was this perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>This he said, not because he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the money box; and he used to pilfer the things which were placed in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>But Jesus said, "Let her alone; she has kept this for the day of My burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor you have with you always, but Me you do not have always."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>Now a large crowd from the Jews knew that He was there; and they came, not for Jesus' sake only, but that they might also see Lazarus, whom He had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests took counsel, that they might also kill Lazarus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because on account of him many of the Jews were going [away], and were believing in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the next day a large crowd which was coming to the feast, having heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet Him, and they were crying out, "Hosanna! 'Blessed is He who comes in the name of the LORD!' The King of Israel!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>Then Jesus, when He had found a young donkey, he sat on it; as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>"Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on the colt of a donkey."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things were written about Him, and they did these things to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>Therefore the crowd which was with Him when He called Lazarus out of his tomb and raised him from the dead, was testifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>On account of this the crowd also met Him, because they heard that He had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, "You see that you are not doing any good. Look, the world has gone after Him!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>And there were some Greeks among those coming up, so that they might worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>Then they approached Philip, who was from Bethsaida of Galilee, and they asked him, saying, "Sir, we wish to see Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>Philip came and told Andrew, and in turn Andrew and Philip told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>But Jesus answered them, saying, "The hour has come that the Son of Man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Most assuredly I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He that loves his life shall lose it, and he that hates his life in this world shall keep it for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>And if anyone serve Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there My servant shall be also. If anyone serve Me, him My Father will honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>"Now My soul has been troubled, and what shall I say? 'Father, save Me from this hour'? But for this reason I came to this hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>Father, glorify Your name."Then a voice came out of heaven, saying, "I have both glorified it and will glorify [it] again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>Therefore the crowd which was standing and heard were saying that it had thundered. Others were saying, "An angel has spoken to Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jesus answered and said, "This voice did not come for My sake, but for your sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world; now the ruler of this world shall be cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all [peoples] to Myself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>This He said, signifying by what kind of death He was about to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The crowd answered Him, "We heard from the law that the Christ abides forever; and so how do You say, 'The Son of Man must be lifted up'? Who is this Son of Man?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Then Jesus said to them, "[For] yet a little while longer the light is with you. Walk while you have the light, lest darkness overtake you; he who walks in darkness does not know where he is going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become sons of light."These things Jesus spoke, and departing, He was hidden from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But even though He had done so many signs in their presence, they did not believe in Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he said: "Lord, who has believed our report? And to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Therefore they could not believe, because Isaiah said again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>"He has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts, lest they should see with their eyes, lest they should understand with their hearts and turn, and I would heal them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These things Isaiah said when he saw His glory and spoke about Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Nevertheless even from among the rulers many believed in Him, but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be excommunicated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>Then Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in Me, believes not in Me but in Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who sees Me sees Him who sent Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I have come as a light into the world, so that whoever believes in Me may not abide in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And if anyone hears My words and does not believe, I do not judge him; for I did not come that I might judge the world, but that I might save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He that rejects Me, and does not receive My words, has that which judges him-the word which I spoke, that [word] will judge him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I have not spoken on My own [authority]; but the Father who sent Me gave Me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that His command is eternal life. Therefore, whatever I speak, as the Father has said to Me, thus I speak."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.13'>
        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour had come that He should depart from this world to the Father, having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And after supper, the devil having already put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon's son, to betray Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.3'>Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into His hands, and that He had come from God and was going to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.4'>He rose from the supper and laid aside His garments, and having taken a towel, He girded Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.5'>Then He poured water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples, and to dry [them] with the towel with which He was girded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.6'>Then He came to Simon Peter. And Peter said to Him, "Lord, do You wash my feet?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.7'>Jesus answered and said to him, "What I am doing you do not understand now, but you shall know after this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.8'>Peter said to Him, "You shall never wash my feet!"Jesus answered him, "Unless I wash you, you have no part with Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.9'>Simon Peter said to Him, "Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.10'>Jesus said to him, "He that is bathed need only to wash his feet, but is completely clean; and you are clean, but not all of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.11'>For He knew who would betray Him; therefore He said, "You are not all clean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.12'>So when He had washed their feet, and had taken His garments, He reclined again, and said to them, "Do you know what I have done to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.13'>You call me Teacher and Lord, and you say correctly, for so I am.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.21'>When Jesus had said these things, He was troubled in His spirit, and testified and said, "Most assuredly I say to you, one of you will betray Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.22'>Therefore the disciples were looking at one another, perplexed about whom He was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.23'>Now there was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of His disciples, [the one ]whom Jesus loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.24'>Simon Peter therefore motioned to him to inquire who it might be about whom He was speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.25'>Then, leaning back thus on Jesus' chest, he said to Him, "Lord, who is it?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.26'>Jesus answered, "It is the [one] to whom I shall give a piece of bread when I have dipped it."And having dipped the bread, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.27'>And after the piece of bread, then Satan entered him. Therefore Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly."</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.29'>For some were thinking, since Judas had the money box, that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy [the ]things of which we need for the feast,"or that he should give something to the poor.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>Therefore, when the chief priests and the attendants saw Him, they cried out, saying, "Crucify, crucify Him!"Pilate said to them, "You take Him and crucify [Him], for I find no fault in Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, "We have a law, and according to our law He ought to die, because He made Himself the Son of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>Therefore, when Pilate heard this saying, he was [even] more afraid,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and he entered into the Praetorium again, and said to Jesus, "Where are You from?"But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Then Pilate said to Him, "Are You not speaking to me? Do You not know that I have authority to crucify You, and I have authority to release You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered, "You would have no authority at all against Me unless it had been given to you from above. Therefore the one who betrayed Me to you has a greater sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>From this [point ]Pilate was seeking to release Him, but the Jews kept crying out, saying, "If you release this [Man], you are no friend of Caesar's. Whoever makes himself a king speaks against Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>Therefore Pilate, having heard this saying, led Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place that is called [The] Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the Preparation [Day] of the Passover, and about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jews, "Behold your King!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, "Away [with Him], away [with Him]! Crucify Him!"Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then he delivered Him to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus and led [Him ]away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And bearing His cross, He went out to a place called the Place of a Skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified Him, and two others with Him, one on each side, and Jesus in the middle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>Now Pilate wrote a title and he put [it] on the cross. And it was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>Then many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Greek, and in Latin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>Therefore the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, "Do not write, 'The King of the Jews,' but, 'He said, "I am the King of the Jews."' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, "What I have written, I have written."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>Then the soldiers, when they crucified Jesus, took His garments and made four parts, to each soldier a part, and also the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven from the top in one piece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>Therefore they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but let us cast lots for it, whose it will be,"so that the Scripture might be fulfilled which says: "They divided My garments among them, and for My clothing they cast lots."Therefore the soldiers did these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>Now there stood by the cross of Jesus His mother, and His mother's sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Therefore Jesus, seeing His mother, and the disciple whom He loved standing by, He said to His mother, "Woman, behold your son!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then He said to the disciple, "Behold your mother!"And from that hour that disciple took her into his own [care].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this, Jesus, seeing that all things already had been fulfilled, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled, He said, "I thirst!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>Now a vessel was set full of sour wine; and they, having filled a sponge with sour wine, put it around a hyssop, they held it to His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>Therefore when Jesus received the sour wine, He said, "It is finished!"And bowing His head, He gave up His spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>Therefore the Jews, since it was the Preparation [Day], that the bodies should not remain on the cross on the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was a high day), asked Pilate that their legs might be broken, and they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>Then the soldiers came and they broke the legs of the first [man,] and of the other who was crucified with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>But having come to Jesus, when they saw that He was already dead, they did not break His legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers pierced His side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who has seen has testified, and his testimony is true; and he knows that he tells the truth, so that you may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done that the Scripture should be fulfilled, "Not a bone of His shall be broken."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another Scripture says, "They shall look at [Him] whom they pierced."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After these things[,] Joseph of Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus; and Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nicodemus, who at first came to Jesus by night, also came, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>Then they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen strips with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>So there they laid Jesus, because of the Jews' Preparation Day, because the tomb was near.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>On the first day of the week Mary Magdalene went to the tomb early, while it was still dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>Therefore she ran and came to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple, whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went out, and the other disciple, and were going to the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And the two together were running, and the other disciple outran Peter and came to the tomb first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And stooping to look in, he saw the linen strips lying there; however he did not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Then Simon Peter came, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he saw the linen strips lying there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the facecloth which had been on His head, not lying with the linen strips, but apart from [them,] having been rolled up in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then the other disciple, who came to the tomb first, went in also; and he saw and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they did not know the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>Then the disciples went away again to their own homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary stood outside facing the tomb weeping. Therefore as she was weeping, she stooped down [and] [looked] into the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>And she saw two angels in white sitting, one at the head and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>Then they said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping?"She said to them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I do not know where they put Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>And having said these things, she turned back and saw Jesus standing there, and did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus said to her, "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?"She, supposing Him to be the gardener, said to Him, "Sir, if You carried Him away, tell me where You put Him, and I will take Him away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus said to her, "Mary!"She turned and said to Him, "Rabboni!"(which means, Teacher).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus said to her, "Do not cling to Me, for I have not yet ascended to My Father; but go to My brothers and say to them, 'I am ascending to My Father and your Father, and to My God and your God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene went reporting to the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and [that] He had spoken these things to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>Then, the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and said to them, "Peace to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And having said this, He showed them His hands and His side. Then the disciples rejoiced when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Therefore Jesus said to them again, "Peace to you! Just as the Father has sent Me, I also send you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said to him, "We have seen the Lord."So he said to them, "Unless I see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and put my hand into His side, I will by no means believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days His disciples were again inside, and Thomas with them. Jesus came, the doors having been closed, and stood in the midst, and said, "Peace to you!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then He said to Thomas, "Bring your finger here, and see My hands; and bring your hand here, and put [it] into My side. Be not unbelieving, but believing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thomas answered and said to Him, "My Lord and my God!"</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>And truly Jesus did many other signs in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these have been written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that [by ]believing you may have life in His name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus showed Himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias, and in this manner He showed Himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>Simon Peter, Thomas called the Twin, Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, the [sons] of Zebedee, and two others of His disciples were together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter said to them, "I am going fishing."They said to him, "We are coming with you also."They went out and immediately got into the boat, and that night they caught nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But as daybreak had already come, Jesus stood upon the shore; however the disciples did not know that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Then Jesus said to them, "Children, have you any food?"They answered Him, "No."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And He said to them, "Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find [some]."Therefore they cast, and they were not able to haul it in because of the multitude of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved said to Peter, "It is the Lord!"Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his outer garment (for he had removed it), and he threw himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits), dragging the net with fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>Then as they got off onto the land, they saw a charcoal fire laid there, and fish placed on it, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus said to them, "Bring [some] of the fish which you have just caught."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter went up and hauled the net onto the land, full of large fish, one hundred and fifty-three; and although there were so many, the net was not torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus said to them, "Come, eat breakfast."Yet none of the disciples dared to question Him, "Who are You?"-knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus then came and took the bread and gave it to them, and likewise the fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This [was] now the third time Jesus was manifested to His disciples, having been raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>So when they had eaten breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, "Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me more than these?"He said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I care for You."He said to him, "Feed My lambs."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He said to him again a second time, "Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you love Me?"He said to Him, "Yes, Lord; You know that I care for You."He said to him, "Shepherd My sheep."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He said to him the third time, "Simon, [son] of Jonah, do you care for Me?"Peter was grieved because He said to him the third time, "Do you care for Me?"And he said to Him, "Lord, You know all things; You know that I care for You."Jesus said to him, "Feed My sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Most assuredly I say to you, when you were younger, you used to dress yourself and used to walk where you wished; but when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and will carry [you] where you do not wish."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>But this He said, signifying by what kind of death he would glorify God. And when He had spoken this, He said to him, "Follow Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Then Peter, turning around, saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following, who also had reclined on His chest at the supper, and said, "Lord, who is the one who betrays You?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter, seeing him, said to Jesus, "But Lord, what [about] this [man]?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus said to him, "If I will that he remain till I come, what is [that] to you? You follow Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>Therefore this saying went out among the brothers that this disciple would not die. Yet Jesus did not say to him that he would not die, but, "If I will that he remain till I come, what is [that] to you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who testifies of these things, and wrote these things; and we know that his testimony is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself would have room for the books which would be written. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>to whom He also presented Himself alive after His suffering by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking of the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And being assembled together with them, He commanded them not to withdraw from Jerusalem, but to await for the Promise of the Father, "which,"He said, "you have heard from Me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>for John baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>Therefore, when they had come together, they asked Him, saying, "Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>And He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons which the Father has placed in His own authority.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David says concerning Him, "I foresaw the Lord always before Me, because He is at My right hand, that I may not be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; moreover my flesh also will dwell in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>Because You will not abandon my soul in Hades, nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You have made known to me the ways of life; You will fill me full of joy in Your presence."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>"Men, brothers, let[ me] speak with boldness to you about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>"Therefore, being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that of the fruit of his loins, according to the flesh, He would raise up the Christ to seat [Him ]on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>foreseeing [this], he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, "that His soul was not left in Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>"This Jesus God has raised up, of which we all are witnesses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>"Therefore having being exalted to the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He poured out this which you now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>"For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he says himself: `The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at My right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>Till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>"Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Now having heard this, they were cut to the heart, and they said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Men and brothers, what shall we do?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Then Peter said to them, "Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>"For the promise is for you and for your children, and for all those afar off, as many as the Lord our God will call."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, "Be saved from this crooked generation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Then those who gladly received his word were baptized; and that day about three thousand souls were added.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they were continuing in the teaching of the apostles, and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>Then fear came upon every person, and many wonders and signs were taking place through the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>Now all who believed were together, and they had all things in common,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>and they were selling their possessions and goods, and were dividing them among all, to the degree that anyone had a need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>So continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they were sharing food with joy and simplicity of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord was adding to the church daily those who were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now Peter and John were going up together to the temple at the hour of prayer, [which was ]the ninth [hour].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a man lame from his mother's womb was being carried, whom they would lay each day at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms from those who entered the temple;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>who, when he saw Peter and John about to enter into the temple, began asking for alms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And looking intently on him, Peter together with John, said "Look at us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter said, "Silver and gold I do not have, but [that ]which I do have, I give to you: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, get up and walk."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And taking hold of him by his right hand, he raised [him]; and immediately his feet and ankles were strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>So he, leaping up, stood and walked and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>Then they recognized that this was the one sitting for the alms at the Beautiful Gate of the temple; and they were filled with astonishment and amazement because of that which had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And while the lame man who had been healed held on to Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch which is called Solomon's, utterly astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>So when Peter saw [this], he replied to the people: "Men of Israel, why do you marvel at this? Or why look so intently at us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made him to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified His Servant Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up and denied Him in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked that a murderer be released to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>and killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And on the basis of faith in His name, this [one ]whom you observe and know, was made strong by His name. And the faith, which is by Him, has given to him this wholeness before you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as your rulers did also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But those things which God announced beforehand by the mouth of all His prophets, that the Christ would suffer, He has thus fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent therefore and turn back, that your sins may be wiped away, in order that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>and that He may send He who had been ordained to be your Messiah, Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom[ ]heaven must receive until the times of restoration of all things, which God has spoken by the mouth of all His holy prophets since the world began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>For Moses said to the fathers, 'The LORD our God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever He says to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>'And it shall be that every person who does not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>Yes, and all the prophets, from Samuel and his successors, as many as have spoken, have proclaimed these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with our fathers, saying to Abraham, 'And in your offspring all the families of the earth shall be blessed.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>To you first, God, having raised up His Servant Jesus, sent Him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>Now while they were speaking to the people, the priests, the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees came upon them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being greatly disturbed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they laid hands on them, and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>However, many of those who heard the word believed; and the number of the men came to be about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>Now it came to pass, on the next day, that their rulers, elders, and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>as well as Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, and Alexander, and as many as were of high priestly descent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And they brought them forward and began to inquire, "By what power or by what name have you done this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter, having been filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>If we today are being judged for a good work to a weak man, by what means he has been made well,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>let it be known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by this[ name] this [man] stands here before you whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the 'stone which was rejected by you, the builders, which became the chief cornerstone.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>Nor is there salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven which has been given among men by which we must be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Now when they observed the boldness of Peter and John, and understood that they were uneducated and untrained men, they marveled. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>But because they saw standing with them the man who had been healed, they had nothing to say against [them].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>And they commanded them to go away outside the council, and began to confer among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, "What shall we do to these men? For indeed, that a known sign has come to pass by them is evident to all those who are dwelling in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But lest it be spread further among the people, let us threaten them with a threat, to speak no longer in this name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And summoning them, they commanded them not to speak at all nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answered them and said, "Whether it is right before God to hear you rather than God, you judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>For we can do none other but to speak the things which we saw and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>So having threatened them further, they released them, finding no way of punishing them, on account of the people, because they all were glorifying God over that which had occurred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man was over forty, on whom had come about this sign of healing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And being released, they came to their own, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>So when they heard that, they raised their voice to God with one mind and said: "Lord, You are God, who made heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>who by the mouth of Your servant David have said: 'Why did the nations rage, and the people conspired vain things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth took their stand, and the rulers were assembled together against the LORD and against His Christ.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>"For truly they were assembled against Your holy Servant Jesus, whom You anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the people of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do all that Your hand and Your counsel foreordained to come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>Now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to Your servants that with all boldness they may speak Your word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>by extending Your hand to heal, and that signs and wonders may come about through the name of Your holy Servant Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And when they had prayed, the place where they were gathered was shaken; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>Now the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and one soul; neither did anyone say that any of the things belonging to him was his own, but they had all things in common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And with great power the apostles were giving forth their witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus. And great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>Nor was there anyone needy among them; for all who were owners of lands or houses were selling them, and were bringing the proceeds of the things which had been sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and were placing them beside the feet of the apostles; and they were distributing to each, to the degree that anyone had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>And Joses, who was also named Barnabas by the apostles (which is translated Son of Encouragement), a Levite, a Cyprian by nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>who, possessing a field, sold it and brought the money and placed it beside the feet of the apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a certain man named Ananias, together with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>And he kept back for himself from the price, his wife also being aware of it, and brought a certain part and placed it beside the feet of the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart [for] you to lie to the Holy Spirit, and [for ]you to keep back for yourself from the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>While it remained unsold, did it not remain yours? And after it was sold, was it not in your control? Why have you purposed this thing in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>Then Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and died. And great fear came upon all those who heard of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>And the young men rose up and covered him up, carried him out, and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>And it happened about three hours later, that his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>And Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much?"She said, "Yes, for so much."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>Then Peter said to her, "Why is it that it was agreed by you to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they shall carry you out [as well]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>Then immediately she fell down beside his feet and died. And the young men came in and found her dead, and carrying her out, buried her with her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear came to be on all the church and upon all those who were hearing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>Now by the hands of the apostles, many signs and wonders took place among the people. And they were all with one mind in Solomon's Porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>But none of the rest dared join them, but the people were magnifying them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>And more than ever, believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>so that they were bringing the sick[ ]and placing them on couches and pallets, so that as Peter was passing by, at least his shadow might fall on some of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>And also the multitude from the surrounding cities were coming together into Jerusalem, bringing the[ ]sick and those[ ]who were tormented by unclean spirits, who were all being healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>Then the high priest rose up, and all those who were with him (which is the sect of the Sadducees), and they were filled with jealousy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>and laid their hands on the apostles and put them in the public custody.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But an angel of the Lord during the night opened the doors of the prison, and leading them out, he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>"Go, stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>And when they heard that, they entered the temple about daybreak and were teaching. Now when the high priest and those with him arrived, they called together the council, even all the elders of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison for them to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>But when the attendants arrived, and did not find them in the jail, they returned and announced,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying, "Indeed we found the prison shut in all security, and the guards standing before the doors; but when we opened them, we found no one [inside]!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>Now when they heard these words, both the high priest and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests, they were greatly perplexed about them, as to what would come of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>So one came and reported to them, [saying], "Behold, the men whom you put in jail are standing in the temple and teaching the people!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>Then the captain went with the officers and brought them without violence, for they were afraid of the people, lest they be stoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>And they brought them, and set them before the council. And the high priest asked them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>saying, "Did we not give you strict orders not to continue teaching in this name? And behold, you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you want to bring on us the blood of this Man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>But Peter and the apostles answered, and said: "We must obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom you murdered by hanging upon a cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>Him God has exalted to His right hand as Prince and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>And we are His witnesses of these words, and so also is the Holy Spirit whom God has given to those who obey Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>But when they heard this, they were infuriated and were resolving to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>Then someone in the council stood up, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, and commanded them to put the apostles outside for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>And he said to them: "Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves to these men, as to what you are about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For before these days, Theudas rose up, claiming himself to be someone, to whom was joined a number of men, about four hundred. He was slain, and all who obeyed him were scattered and came to nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After this arose Judas the Galilean, in the days of the census, and caused considerable number of people after him to revolt. He too perished, and as many as were persuaded by him were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>And now I say to you, keep away from these men and let them alone; for if the counsel or this work is of men, it will come to nothing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>but if it is of God, you cannot overthrow it-lest you even be found fighting against God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>And they were persuaded by him, and when they called the apostles and beaten them, they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and released them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>Then they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing because they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>And daily in the temple, and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and proclaiming the gospel of Jesus the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.6'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>Now in those days, as the disciples were increasing in number, there arose a complaint from the Greek speaking Jews against the Aramaic speaking Jews, because their widows were being overlooked in the daily distribution.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>Then the twelve summoned the multitude of the disciples and said, "It is not pleasing to us that we should forsake the word of God to serve tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>Therefore, brothers, select seven men from among you, of good reputation, full of the Holy Spirit and wisdom, whom we may appoint for this need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.4'>But we will faithfully engage in prayer and in the ministry of the word."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>And the word was pleasing before all the congregation, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, and Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte from Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>whom they set before the apostles; and when they had prayed, they laid their hands on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>And the word of God was growing, and the number of the disciples in Jerusalem was being multiplied exceedingly, and a great many of the priests were obeying the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>And Stephen, full of faith and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>But there arose some men from what was called the Synagogue of the Freedmen, both of the Cyrenians and the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, debating with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>And they were not able to withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>Then they secretly instigated men to say, "We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>And they aroused the people and the elders and the scribes; and coming upon him, they seized him, and led him to the council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>And they put forward false witnesses saying, "This man does not cease to speak blasphemous words against this holy place and the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.14'>for we have heard him say that this Nazarene, Jesus, will destroy this place and change the customs which Moses handed down to us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.15'>And looking intently at him, all those who sat in the council saw that his face was like[ ]the face of an angel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.7'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>Then the high priest said, "Are these things so?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>And he said, "Men, brothers and fathers, listen: The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.3'>and said to him, 'Go out from your land and from your relatives, and come to a land which I will show you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>Then he went forth from the land of the Chaldeans and settled down in Haran. And from there, after his father was dead, He moved him to this land in which you now dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>And He gave him no inheritance in it, not even a place to put his foot on, and He promised to give it to him for a possession, and to his descendants after him, though he had no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>But God spoke in this way: that his offspring would dwell in a foreign land, and that they would enslave them, and they would treat them badly four hundred years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>'And the nation which they will serve, I will judge,' said God, 'and after these things they will come out and serve Me in this place.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>Then He gave him the covenant of circumcision; and so Abraham fathered Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day; and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered the twelve patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>"And the patriarchs, being jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; and God was with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>and delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt; and he made him ruler over Egypt and all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.11'>And a famine came over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no provisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.12'>And Jacob, hearing that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.13'>And the second [visit] Joseph was made known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.14'>Then Joseph sent and summoned his father Jacob and all his relatives, seventy-five people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.15'>So Jacob went down to Egypt; and he died, he and our fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.16'>And they were brought back to Shechem, and were placed in the tomb which Abraham bought for a price of silver from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.17'>Now when the time of the promise drew near which God swore to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.18'>until there arose a different king, who did not know Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.19'>This [king] took advantage of our race, and oppressed our fathers, to make their babies exposed, in order that they might not preserve their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.20'>At this time Moses was born, and he was well pleasing to God; who was brought up in his father's house for three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.21'>But when he was exposed, the daughter of Pharaoh took him up, and brought him up for herself as a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.22'>And Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in words and deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.23'>Now when he had turned forty years old, it came into his heart to look upon his brothers, the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.24'>And seeing someone being wronged, he retaliated, and avenged him who was being oppressed, and struck the Egyptian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.25'>For he supposed that his brothers understood that God was giving to them deliverance by his hand, but they did not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.26'>And on the next day he appeared to them as they were fighting, and [tried to] reconcile them to peace, saying, 'Men, you are brothers; why do you wrong one another?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.27'>"But the one wronging his neighbor pushed him away, saying, 'Who appointed you a ruler and a judge over us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.28'>'Do you desire to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.29'>Now Moses, at this saying, fled and became a stranger in the land of Midian, where he fathered two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.30'>And forty years having been fulfilled, an Angel of the Lord appeared to him in a flame of fire in a bush, in the wilderness of Mount Sinai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.31'>And Moses, seeing it, marveled at the sight; and as he approached it to observe closely, the voice of the Lord came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.32'>saying, 'I am the God of your fathers-the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.' And Moses was trembling and was not bold enough to look closely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.33'>'Then the LORD said to him, "Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you stand is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.34'>"I have certainly seen the mistreatment of My people in Egypt; I have heard their groaning and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.35'>This Moses whom they denied, saying, 'Who appointed you a ruler and a judge?' This man God sent as a ruler and redeemer by the hand of the Angel who appeared to him in the bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.36'>He led them out, and did wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.37'>"This is that Moses who said to the sons of Israel, 'The LORD our God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from your brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.38'>This is he who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the Angel who was speaking to him on Mount Sinai, and [with] our fathers, the one who received the living oracles to give to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.39'>whom our fathers did not desire to be obedient, but they rejected [him] and returned in their heart back to Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.40'>saying to Aaron, 'Make for us gods who will go before us; as for this Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.41'>And they made a calf in those days, offered a sacrifice to the idol, and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.42'>But God turned away and gave them over to serve the host of heaven, just as it is written in the book of the Prophets: 'Did you offer Me slaughtered animals and sacrifices during forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.43'>Indeed you carried up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of your god Remphan, the images which you made to worship them; and I will relocate you beyond Babylon.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.44'>"The tabernacle of the testimony was with our fathers in the wilderness, just as the One speaking to Moses commanded him, to make it according to the pattern that he had seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.45'>which also our fathers, having received in turn, also brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers until the days of David,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.46'>who found favor before God and asked [opportunity ]to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.47'>But Solomon built Him a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.48'>However, the Most High does not dwell in hand-made sanctuaries, just as the prophet says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.49'>'Heaven is My throne, and [the ]earth is My footstool. What kind of house will you build for Me? says the LORD, or what is the place of My rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.50'>Did not My hand make all these things?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.51'>"You stiff-necked and uncircumcised in heart and ears! You always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers did, you also do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.52'>Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who foretold about the coming of the Righteous One, of whom you have now become betrayers and murderers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.53'>who have received the law as [the ]ordinances of angels and you did not keep it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.54'>Now hearing these things they were infuriated in their hearts, and were gnashing their teeth at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.55'>But being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.56'>and he said, "Behold! I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.57'>Then they cried out with a loud voice, covered their ears, and ran at him with one purpose;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.58'>and casting him outside the city, they stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their clothes beside the feet of a young man named Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.59'>And they stoned Stephen as he was calling on God and saying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.60'>Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not charge them with this sin."And having said this, he fell asleep."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.8'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.1'>Now Saul was agreeing with them in his murder. And in that day there arose a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and they all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.2'>And godly men buried Stephen, and they mourned deeply for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.3'>But Saul was doing injury to the church, going in from house to house, and dragging away both men and women, and putting them in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.4'>Therefore those who were scattered went about preaching the good news of the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.5'>And Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, was preaching to them the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.6'>And the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the signs which he was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.7'>For many of those having unclean spirits [had ]cried out with a loud voice, [and the spirits ]came out; and many who were paralyzed and lame were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.8'>And there was great joy in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.9'>Now a certain man named Simon was previously in the city practicing magic and astounding the people of Samaria, claiming himself to be someone great,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.10'>to whom they gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the great power of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.11'>But they gave heed to him because of the long time that he had astonished them with the magic arts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.12'>But when they believed Philip as he preached the good news of the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.13'>Then Simon himself also believed; and having been baptized, he was continuing with Philip, and observing miracles and signs occurring, he was astounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.14'>Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.15'>who, coming down, prayed concerning them in order that they might receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.16'>For He had not yet fallen upon any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.17'>Then they laid hands upon them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.18'>Now when Simon observed that by the laying on of the apostles' hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.19'>saying, "Give me this power also, that on whom ever I lay my hands he may receive the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.20'>But Peter said to him, "Your money perish with you, because you thought to acquire the gift of God through money!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.21'>You have neither part nor portion in this word, for your heart is not right before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.22'>Repent therefore from this your wickedness, and make petition to God, if perhaps the intent of your heart will be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.23'>For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of unrighteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.24'>Then Simon answered and said, "Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken may come upon me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.25'>Then solemnly bearing witness to and speaking the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many Samaritan villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.26'>Now an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip, saying, "Get up and go toward the south on the road which goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza."This is desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.27'>So he got up and went; and behold, a man of Ethiopia, a eunuch, a court official of Candace the queen of the Ethiopians, who was over all her treasury, and had come to Jerusalem worshipping,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.28'>and he was returning. And sitting upon his chariot, he was reading the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.29'>Then the Spirit said to Philip, "Go near, and join yourself to this chariot."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.30'>And Phillip, running up to it, heard him reading the prophet Isaiah, and said, "Do you understand what you are reading?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.31'>And he said, "How can I, unless someone helps me?"And he urged Philip to come up and sit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.32'>Now the portion of the Scripture which he was reading was this: "He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and as a lamb before its shearer is silent, thus He opened not His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.33'>In His humiliation His justice was taken away, and who will recount His generation? For His life is taken away from the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.34'>So the eunuch answered Philip and said, "Please tell me, of whom does the prophet say this; of himself, or of someone else?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>And Philip, opening his mouth, and beginning from this Scripture, preached the good news [about] Jesus to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>Now as they were going down the road, they came upon some water. And the eunuch said, "Behold, [here is] water: what prevents me from being baptized?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.37'>- - -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>And he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, both Phillip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>Now when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught up Philip, and the eunuch did not see him any longer; and he went on his way rejoicing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>But Philip was found at Azotus. And as he passed through, he preached the gospel to all the cities until he came to Caesarea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.9'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>Then Saul, still breathing murderous threats against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>and requested from him letters [of authority ]to the synagogues of Damascus, that if he should find any who were of the Way, both men or women, he might bring them, having been bound, to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>And as he was going, it came about that he drew near to Damascus, and suddenly a light shone around him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>And falling on the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>And he said, "Who are You, Lord?"And the Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>"But rise up and enter into the city, and it will be spoken to you what you must do."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>And the men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>And Saul got up from the ground, and although his eyes were open, he saw no one; and leading him by the hand, they brought [him] into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>And he was three days not seeing, and neither ate nor drank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>Now there was a certain disciple at Damascus named Ananias; and the Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias."And he said, "Behold I [am here], Lord."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And the Lord said to him, "Arise and go to Straight Street, and seek out in the house of Judas a man named Saul, of Tarsus; for behold, he is praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>And he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him, so that he might see again."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many wicked things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who are calling on Your name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen vessel to Me to bear My name before Gentiles and kings, and the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I will show him all the things that he must suffer for My name's sake."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>And Ananias departed and entered the house; and laying his hands on him, he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord has sent me, He who appeared to you in the way which you were coming, so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And immediately[ something] like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. And he got up and was baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Now Saul was with the disciples in Damascus three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And immediately in the synagogues he was proclaiming Christ, that He is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>And all those who heard were astounded, and were saying, "Is this not the one who destroyed those who called on this name in Jerusalem, and has come here for that purpose, so that he might take them having been bound, to the chief priests?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul all the more was growing strong, and was confounding the Jews who were dwelling in Damascus, proving that this [Jesus] is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>Now when many days were fulfilled, the Jews plotted to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>But their plot became known to Saul. And they closely watched the [city] gates both day and night, in order that they might kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>But the disciples, taking him by night, they let him down through the wall, lowering [him ]in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>Now when Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join himself to the disciples; but they all were afraid of him, not believing that he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas, taking hold of him, brought him to the apostles, and related to them how he had seen the Lord on the way, and that He had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he spoke boldly in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus, and he was speaking and disputing with the Greek-speaking Jews, but they were attempting to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>But the brothers, learning about it, brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>Then the churches throughout all Judea, Galilee, and Samaria had peace and were edified, and going in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, were multiplying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>Now it came to pass, as Peter went through all [parts of the country], that he went down to the saints who were dwelling in Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>And he found there a certain man named Aeneas, who had been confined to a bed for eight years,[ ]who was paralyzed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>And Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals you. Arise and make your bed."Then he arose immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>And all who were dwelling at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>Now in Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. This [woman] was full of good works and charitable giving which she was doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>But it came about in those days that she became ill and died; and they washed her, and put [her] in an upper room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>Now since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter was in Joppa, sent to him, urging him not to delay in coming to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>And arising, Peter went with them. When he arrived, they took him into the upper room, and all the widows stood beside him weeping, showing [him ]tunics and cloaks which Dorcas was making, [while ]she was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Peter, having put them all outside, knelt down and prayed. And turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, arise."And she opened her eyes, and seeing Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>And giving to her his hand, he raised her up; and when he called the saints and the widows, he presented her alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And it became known throughout all of Joppa, and many believed on the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>And he stayed for some time in Joppa with a tanner [named ]Simon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>Now there was a certain man in Caesarea named Cornelius, a centurion of what was called the Italian [Regiment],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>a devout [man], and one that feared God, together with all his household, who often gave alms to the people, and making petition to God always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>About the ninth hour of the day, he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, "Cornelius!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And looking intently at him and becoming fearful he said, "What is it, lord?"And he said to him, "Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>Now send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He is staying as a guest with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is beside the sea."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>Now when the angel who had been speaking to Cornelius had departed, he called two of his household servants and a devout soldier from among those who waited on him continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>And explaining to them everything, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>Now on the next day, as they were traveling and drawing near to the city, Peter went up on the housetop to pray, [at ]about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he became hungry and wanted to eat; but while they were preparing, a trance fell on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>And he saw heaven having been opened, and descending to him a certain vessel like a great sheet, having been bound at the four corners, and being let down upon the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which were all the four-footed [animals] of the earth and the wild animals, and the reptiles, and the birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And there[ ]came a voice to him, [saying], "Arise, Peter; kill and eat."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, "By no means, Lord! For never did I eat anything common or unclean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And a voice [spoke] again the second [time ]to him, "That which God has made clean, you must not make common."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>And this happened three times, and again the vessel was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Now as Peter was very perplexed within himself as to what the vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men who had been sent from Cornelius, having found by inquiry the house of Simon, stood at the gateway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>And they called and asked whether Simon, whose surname was Peter, was lodging there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>Now while Peter pondered about the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, men are seeking you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Arise therefore, go down and go with them, without wavering; for I have sent them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>And Peter, going down to the men, said, "Behold, I am he whom you seek. What is the reason for which you are here?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, "Cornelius the centurion, a righteous and God-fearing man, having a good reputation among all the nation of the Jews, was given a revelation by a holy angel to send for you to his house, and to hear words from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>Therefore he invited them in and received [them] as guests. Now on the next day Peter went forth with them, and some brothers from Joppa went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And on the next day they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his relatives and close friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>Now when it happened that Peter entered, Cornelius met him, [and] fell at his feet and worshipped [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter raised him up, saying, "Stand up; I myself am also a man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And talking with him he went in, and found many having gathered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>and he said to them, "You know how unlawful it is for a Jewish man to associate with or to approach a Gentile; and yet God has shown to me that I should call no man common or unclean;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>therefore also without objecting, I came when I was sent for. I ask, then, for what reason have you sent for me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>So Cornelius said, "From the fourth day until this hour I was fasting, and at the ninth hour I was praying in my house, and behold, a man stood before me in shining clothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your alms have been remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send therefore to Joppa and summon Simon, whose surname is Peter. He is staying as a guest in the house of Simon, a tanner, beside the sea. When he arrives, he will speak to you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>"Therefore immediately I sent to you, and you have done well to come. Now then we are all present before God, to hear all the things having been commanded you by God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>And Peter, opening his mouth, said: "In truth I comprehend that God is not One to show partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>But in every nation, he that fears Him and works righteousness is acceptable to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>The word which God sent to the sons of Israel, preaching the good news of peace through Jesus Christ--He being Lord of all-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>you know, the word coming to be throughout all of Judea, and beginning from Galilee after the baptism which John proclaimed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>Jesus of Nazareth, how God anointed Him with the Holy Spirit and with power, who went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are witnesses of all things which He did, both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem, whom they also killed by hanging on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>This [Jesus] God raised up on the third day, and caused Him to be seen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to witnesses, who having been chosen beforehand by God, [even] to us, who ate and drank together with Him after He arose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And He commanded us to proclaim to the people, and to testify solemnly that He is the [One] having been appointed by God [to be] Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To Him all the prophets bear witness, [that ]through His name, everyone believing in Him shall receive forgiveness of sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell upon all those who heard the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And those of the circumcision who believed were astounded, as many as had come with Peter, because the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>"Surely no one can forbid water, can he, that these should not be baptized who received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to stay for some days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that even the Gentiles had also received the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, those of the circumcision were contending with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, "You went in to uncircumcised men and ate with them!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>But Peter, beginning [to speak,] was setting forth to them in order, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>"I was in the city of Joppa praying; and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel coming down like a great sheet, being lowered by the four corners from heaven; and it came as far as me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>on which, looking intently, I was contemplating, and I saw the four-footed [animals] of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the reptiles, and the birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Arise, Peter; kill and eat.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>"But I said, 'By no means, Lord! For nothing common or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>"But the voice answered me a second [time] from heaven, 'What God has made clean, you must not make common.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>"And this was done three times, and again all things[ ]were drawn up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And behold, immediately three men stood before the house in which I was, having been sent from Caesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit said to me to go with them, without wavering. Now these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the house of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he related to us how he had seen the angel in his house, standing and saying to him, 'Send men to Joppa, and send for Simon whose surname is Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>'who will speak words to you by which you and all your household shall be saved.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>"And when I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, as also on us in the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>And I remembered the word of the Lord, how He said, 'John indeed baptized with water, but you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>"If then God has given to them the same gift as He gave to us, when we believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to hinder God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>And hearing these things, they remained silent, and [they] glorified God, saying, "Then God has also granted even to the Gentiles repentance unto life."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Then those who were scattered because of the tribulation coming about over Stephen, went about as far as Phoenicia, and Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>But some of them were men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who, entering into Antioch spoke to the Greek speaking Jews, preaching the good news of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number believed,[ ]and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And the word about them was heard in the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent forth Barnabas to go as far as Antioch;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>who, arriving and seeing the grace of God, was glad, and encouraged them all with purpose of heart to continue with the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a considerable crowd was added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>And Barnabas went forth to Tarsus to seek out Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>and having found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came about that for a whole year they assembled with the church and instructed many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>And rising up, one of them named Agabus, foretold by the Spirit of a great famine about to happen in all the world, which also came to pass in the time of Claudius Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>Then the disciples, each according to his ability, determined as a ministry to send relief to the brothers dwelling in Judea;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>which they also did, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>Now at that time Herod the king put [forth ]his hands to harm some from the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>And he put to death James the brother of John with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he proceeded further to arrest Peter also (these were during the Days of Unleavened Bread),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>whom also seizing, he put him in prison, and handed him over to four four-man squads of soldiers to guard him, planning after the Passover to bring him again to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>Therefore Peter was kept in prison; but earnest prayer was being made by the church to God [on] behalf of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>But when Herod was about to bring him forth, on that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, having been bound with two chains; and guards before the door were keeping the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>And behold, an angel of the Lord stood [there], and a light shined in the prison room; and striking the side of Peter, he roused him saying, "Arise quickly!"And his chains fell away from his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>And the angel said to him, "Gird yourself and put on your sandals"; and he did so. And he said to him, "Put on your cloak and follow me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>And going out, he was following him, and did not know that the thing taking place by the angel was true, but he was thinking that he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And going though the first and the second guard [posts], they came to the iron gate which leads into the city, which was opened to them of its own accord; and going out, they went forward one street, and immediately the angel withdrew from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And Peter, having come to himself, said, "Now I know truly that the Lord has sent forth His angel, and has delivered me from the hand of Herod and from all the expectation of the Jews."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And realizing [this], he came to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose surname was Mark, where a considerable [number] were gathered together and were praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And when Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a servant girl came to answer, named Rhoda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>When she recognized Peter's voice, because of her gladness she did not open the gate, but running in, she announced that Peter stood at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>But they said to her, "You are mad!"Yet she kept insisting that it was so. So they said, "It is his angel."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter was continuing knocking; and opening [the door] they saw him, and were astounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>And motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he related to them how the Lord had led him out of the prison. And he said, "Tell these things to James and to the brothers."And going out, he went to another place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>Now when day came, there was no small disturbance among the soldiers, as to what had become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And Herod, seeking for him and not finding him, he examined the guards, and commanded that they be executed. And going down from Judea to Caesarea, he was spending time [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon; and with one purpose they came to him, and persuading Blastus, the one over the king's bedroom, they asked for peace, because their country was fed from the king's [country].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>And on an appointed day Herod, clothing himself with royal apparel, and sitting on the judgment seat, was delivering an address to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>And the crowds kept calling out, "[This is the] voice of a god and not of a man!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>Then immediately an angel of the Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God. And he was eaten by worms and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But the word of God increased and multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>And Barnabas and Saul returned to Jerusalem, having fulfilled their ministry, taking along with [them] John also, whose surname was Mark.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now there were some in the church being in Antioch [who were] prophets and teachers: both Barnabas, and Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen, brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>Now as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Now separate to Me Barnabas and Saul for the work which I have called them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>Then, fasting and praying, and laying their hands on them, they sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>These two therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>And arriving in Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. They also had John as their assistant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>And going across the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew whose name was Bar-Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man summoned Barnabas and Saul, and sought to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) resisted them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>But Saul, who also is [called] Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and gazing intently at him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>[he ]said, "O full of all guile and all craft, [you] son of [the] devil, [you] enemy of all righteousness, will you not cease perverting the straight ways of the Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>And now behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you shall be blind, not seeing the sun for a season."And immediately a mistiness and darkness fell upon him, and going about, he sought someone to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then when the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Now Paul and his companions put to sea from Paphos, and came to Perga of Pamphylia; But John deserted them and returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>But they went from Perga, and arrived in Antioch of Pisidia, and entering into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>Now after the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders sent to them, saying, "Men and brothers, if there is by you a word of encouragement for the people, speak."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>And Paul, arising and motioning with his hand, said, "Men, Israelites, and you who fear God, listen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people chose our fathers, and lifting up the people during their sojourn in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm brought them out from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>Now for a time of about forty years He put up with them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>And destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, He gave their land to them as an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>And after these things, [for ]about four hundred and fifty years, He gave [them] judges until [the time of] Samuel the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>And then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>And removing him, He raised up for them David as king, to whom He also said bearing witness, 'I have found David the son of Jesse, [to be ]a man after My [own] heart, who will do all My will.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>God, from the seed of this [man,] according to the promise, has brought to Israel salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>after John had first proclaimed before His coming, the baptism of repentance to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>Now as John was finishing his course, he said, 'Whom do you suppose me to be? I am not He. But behold, there comes One after me, the sandal of whose feet I am not worthy to loosen.'</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>Now as the Jews were going out of the synagogue, the Gentiles begged that these words might be spoken to them the next Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>And when the synagogue service was broken up, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, speaking [to them], persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>On the coming Sabbath, almost all the city was assembled to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>And the Jews, seeing the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and spoke against the things being said by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>But Paul and Barnabas, speaking boldly said, "It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken to you first; but since you thrust it away, and judge yourselves not worthy of eternal life; behold, we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For so the Lord has commanded us: 'I have set you to be a light of the nations, that you should be for salvation to the end of the earth.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>Now when the Gentiles heard this, they rejoiced and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>And the word of the Lord was being spread throughout all the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews incited the devout and prominent women and the leading [men] of the city, and raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out from their borders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>But shaking off the dust from their feet against them, they went to Iconium.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>And a certain man in Lystra, powerless in his feet, was sitting, lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>This [man] heard Paul speaking; who, gazing intently on him and seeing that he had faith to be healed,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>And the crowds, seeing what Paul did, raised their voice, saying in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have been made like men and have come down to us!"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard this, they tore their clothes and rushed in to the crowd, crying out</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>and saying, "Men! Why are you doing these things? We men are of the same nature as you, preaching the gospel to you, that you must turn from these useless things to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and all the things in them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in the generations having gone by permitted all the Gentiles to walk in their ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>And yet He did not leave Himself without witness, in that He did good, giving to you rain from heaven and fruit bearing seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>And saying these things, they scarcely stopped the crowds from sacrificing to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>But there arrived from Antioch and Iconium [certain ]Jews, and having persuaded the crowds and having stoned Paul, they dragged [him] outside the city, thinking he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But when the disciples encircled him, he stood and entered into the city. And the next day he went out together with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>And having preached the gospel to that city and having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>strengthening the souls of the disciples, urging [them] to continue in the faith, [saying, "]Through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>And having chosen elders for them in every church, [and ]having prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>And having crossed Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>And having spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>From there they sailed to Antioch, from where they were commended to the grace of God for the work which they had completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>Now arriving and gathering the church together, they related all that God had done with them, and that He had opened the door of faith for the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>And they spent a long time there with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>And certain men coming down from Judea were teaching the brothers, "If you are not circumcised in the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Therefore when there arose a serious dissension and debate with Paul and Barnabus, they determined that Paul and Barnabas and some others of them should go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this issue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>Therefore, being sent forth by the church, they were passing through Phoenicia and Samaria, telling in detail [about] the conversion of the Gentiles; and they were causing great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>And having come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders; and they declared all that God had done with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some of those from the sect of the Pharisees rose up, saying, "It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>And the apostles and elders gathered together to see about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And after much dispute, Peter arose and said to them: "Men, brothers, you know that from early days God chose among us, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as also [He did] to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>and made no distinction between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>Now therefore, why do you test God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>But through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we believe that we will be saved in the same manner as they."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>Then all the multitude stopped speaking and listened to Barnabas and Paul telling as many signs and wonders as God had done among the Gentiles through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>Now after they had finished speaking, James answered, saying, "Men and brothers, listen to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon has declared how God first visited [them ]to take from the Gentiles a people for His name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>"After this I will return, and I will build again the tabernacle of David, which has fallen; and its ruins I will rebuild, and I will restore it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>in order that the rest of men may seek out the LORD, and all the Gentiles who are called by My name, says the LORD who does all these things.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>"Known from everlasting to God are all His works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>Therefore I judge that we must not cause trouble for those who are turning to God from [among] the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but that we write to them to abstain from things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, from things strangled, and [from] blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>"For Moses has had from ancient generations those who proclaim him in each city, being read in the synagogues from one Sabbath to another."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it seemed best to the apostles and the elders, together with the whole church, to send men being chosen from them to Antioch, together with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas who was also named Barsabas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>Writing by their hand these things: The apostles, the elders, and the brothers, to the brothers in Antioch, and Syria, and Cilicia who are of the Gentiles: Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>Inasmuch as we have heard that some went out from among us and troubled you with words, unsettling your souls, saying, 'that you must be circumcised and keep the law'-to whom we gave no [such] command-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>it seemed best to us, having come to be of the same mind, to send men being chosen to you, with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men having given over their lives for the sake of the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who will also tell you the same things by word [of mouth].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it seemed best to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to put on you no greater burden except for these necessary things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>that you abstain from meat offered to idols, and from blood, and from [anything] strangled, and from fornication; from which keeping yourselves back, you will do well. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>Then having been dismissed, they came to Antioch; and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>And when they had read it, they rejoiced over its encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>Now Judas and Silas, themselves being prophets also, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>And when time had passed, they were dismissed with peace from the brothers to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.34'>- - -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>But Paul and Barnabas spent time in Antioch, teaching and preaching the good news of the word of the Lord, with many others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>Then after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return now and visit our brothers in each city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are doing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>But Barnabas desired to take along with them John called Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul considered it fitting not to take along with them the one who withdrew from them in Pamphylia, and who had not gone together with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>Therefore a sharp disagreement arose so that they were separated from one another. And Barnabas, taking along Mark, sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>But Paul, choosing Silas, departed, being given over to the grace of God by the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>Now he arrived at Derbe and Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there named Timothy, the son of a certain Jewish woman who believed, but his father was Greek,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>who had a good testimony by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted [Timothy] to accompany him, and taking him, he circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they were going through the cities, they were delivering to them the decrees to keep, which had been decided by the apostles and the elders at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>Therefore the churches were strengthened in the faith, and were growing in number each day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>Now when they had gone through Phrygia and the Galatian region, they were forbidden by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>having come to Mysia they attempted to go to Bithynia, but the Spirit did not permit them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>So they bypassed Mysia, and went down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>And a vision appeared during the night to Paul. A certain man of Macedonia was standing, urging him, and saying, "Come across to Macedonia and help us."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>Now when he saw the vision, immediately we sought to go out to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Therefore, putting to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day came to Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and from there to Philippi, which is chief of that part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were spending some days in that very city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the city beside a river, where prayer was customarily made; and having sat down we spoke to the women who assembled together [there].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>And a certain woman named Lydia, a dealer of purple cloth of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard us, whose heart the Lord opened to give heed to the things spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And when she and her household were baptized, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay."So she persuaded us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>Now it came to pass, as we went to prayer, that a certain slave girl, having a spirit of Python, met us, who brought much profit to her masters by fortune telling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>This girl, following after Paul and us, was crying out, saying, "These men are the servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And this she did for many days. But Paul, being greatly annoyed and turning around, said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her."And he came out in that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>And when her masters saw that the hope of their profit was gone, they took Paul and Silas, and dragged [them] to the marketplace to the rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>And bringing them to the magistrates they said, "These men, being Jews, are agitating our city;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and they are proclaiming customs which are not lawful for us to receive or to do, since we are Romans."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the crowd rose up together against them; and the magistrates tore their clothes and ordered [men] to beat [them] with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And when they laid many strokes on them, they cast them into prison, commanding the prison keeper to keep them securely;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>who, having received such a command, cast them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>Now about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and all the bonds were loosed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>And becoming awake, the prison keeper, seeing the doors of the prison open, drawing a sword, he was about to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to have escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>And asking for a light he rushed in, and he came trembling, and fell before Paul and Silas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>and he brought them forth outside and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, "Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and you shall be saved, you and your household."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all those in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And taking them along in that same hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he and all his family were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And bringing them up into his house, he set a meal before them; and he rejoiced with his whole house, having believed in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>Now when it became day, the magistrates sent the officers, saying, "Release those men."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the prison keeper announced these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent so that you may be released. Now therefore depart, and go in peace."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, "They beat us publicly, although we were uncondemned Romans, and they cast [us] into prison, and now do they cast us out secretly? No indeed! Let them come themselves and lead us out."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the officers related to the magistrates these words, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>And coming, they appealed to them, and bringing them out, they asked them to depart from the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And coming out from the prison, they entered into [the house of] Lydia; and seeing the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Now traveling through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>And according to Paul's custom, he went in to them, and for three Sabbaths he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>interpreting and pointing out that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to arise from the dead, and [saying ]that "This is the Christ, Jesus, whom I proclaim to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And some of them were persuaded and were joined with Paul and Silas, both of the devout Greeks, a great multitude, and not a few of the chief women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>And the Jews who did not believe [ ]took some wicked men from the marketplace, and forming a mob, [they ]threw the city into disorder, and came upon the house of Jason, and sought to bring them to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>But when they did not find them, they dragged Jason and some brothers to the rulers of the city, crying out, "The men who have upset the whole world, these have come here, too;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>whom Jason has received; and these all practice contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying there is another king-Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And they troubled the crowd and the rulers of the city when they heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>And having taken the security bond from Jason and the rest, they released them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>Then the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away during the night to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>And these were more noble-minded than[ ]those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all readiness, each day examining the Scriptures [to see ]whether these things might be so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Therefore many of them believed, and not a few of the prominent Greek women and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul in Berea, they came there also, agitating the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>Then immediately the brothers sent Paul away, to go toward the sea; but both Silas and Timothy remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And those conducting Paul brought him to Athens; and receiving a command for Silas and Timothy, that as quickly as possible they should come to him, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>And in Athens, while Paul waited for them, his spirit was provoked within him when he saw that the city was full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and with the [Gentile] worshippers, and in the marketplace daily with those coming by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>And also some of the Epicurean and of the Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. And some were saying, "What does this seed-picker wish to say?"But others [said], "He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities,"because he was preaching the good news of Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And taking hold of him, they brought [him] to the Areopagus, saying, "Are we able to know what this new doctrine is you speak about?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For you are bringing some strange things to our ears. Therefore we desire to know what these things might mean."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>Now all the Athenians and the strangers staying there as visitors spent their time in nothing other than to say or to hear some new thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>Then Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, "Men, Athenians, according to all things I perceive you as [being ]very religious;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>for as I passed by and considered the objects of your worship, I found also an altar on which it had been inscribed: TO THE UNKNOWN GOD. Therefore, [Him] whom being ignorant of you worship, this [One] I announce to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God who made the world and all the things in it, Him being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples made by human hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>nor by the hands of men is He served, as though He needed anything, for He gives to all life, and breath, with respect to all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And He made from one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, and He ordained their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>[in order for them ]to seek the Lord, if perhaps indeed they might grope for Him and find [Him], and yet being indeed not far from each one of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>for in Him we live and move and have our being, as also some of your own poets have said, 'For we are also His offspring.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>"Therefore, being the offspring of God, we ought not to suppose that the Godhead is like gold or silver or stone, something shaped by art and the imagination of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>So then these times of ignorance God overlooked, but now He commands all men everywhere to repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>because He has appointed a day in which He is going to judge the world in righteousness by [the] Man whom He has appointed, having given proof to all, by raising Him from the dead."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>But when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some were scoffing, but others said, "We will hear you again concerning this."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>And thus Paul went forth from their midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>However, some men were joined to him and believed, among whom were also Dionysius the Areopagite, a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>Now after these things, having departed from Athens, Paul came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>And he found a certain Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, having recently come from Italy with Priscilla his wife (because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to depart from Rome); he came to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>and because he was of the same trade, he remained with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and persuaded both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>Now when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was compelled by the Spirit, solemnly bearing witness to the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But because they were opposing and blaspheming, he shook off his clothes and said to them, "Your blood [be] on your [own ]heads; I am clean. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And having gone over from there, he went into the house of a certain [man] named Justus, who worshipped God, whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with all his household. And many of the Corinthians, hearing, were believing and were being baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>Now the Lord spoke to Paul by a vision in the night, [saying], "Do not fear, but speak, and do not keep silent;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you; for I have many people in this city."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>And he settled [there] a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>Now while Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one purpose rose up against Paul and brought him before the judgment seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, "This [man] persuades men to worship God contrary to the law."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>And when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If then it was some misdeed or wicked crime, O Jews, according to reason I would bear with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But if it is a question about a word and names and your own law, see [to it] yourselves; for I do not wish to be a judge of these things."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them away from the judgment seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then all the Greeks, taking hold of Sosthenes the ruler of the synagogue, were beating him before the judgment seat. And none of these things was a concern to Gallio.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>Now Paul still remained there a good while, then bid farewell to the brothers, and sailed away for Syria, and Priscilla and Aquila were with him. He had his hair cut off in Cenchrea, for he had taken a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And he arrived in Ephesus, and he left those [two] there; but he, having entered into the synagogue, reasoned with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>And when they asked him to remain with them for a longer time, he did not consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but bid farewell to them saying, "I must by all means keep this coming feast which is in Jerusalem; but I will return again to you, God willing."And he put out to sea from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And having gone down to Caesarea, and having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>After having spent some time there, he went out, going through in order the Galatian region and the Phrygian [region], strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man and mighty in the Scriptures, had arrived in Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things about the Lord, although he knew only the baptism of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he desired to go across to Achaia, having urged him on, the brothers wrote to the disciples [there] to receive him; and when he arrived, he assisted greatly with those who had believed through grace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>for he was powerfully refuting the Jews publicly, demonstrating by the Scriptures [that] Jesus was the Messiah.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>And it came about, while Apollos was in Corinth, that Paul, having gone through the interior regions, came to Ephesus. And finding some disciples</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>[he] said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit, having believed?"So they said to him, "We have not even heard whether there is a Holy Spirit."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>And he said to them, "Into what then were you baptized?"So they said, "Into John's baptism."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>But Paul said, "John indeed baptized with a baptism of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in the One coming after him, that is, in Christ Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And when they heard [this], they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came upon them, and they spoke in tongues and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>Now all the men were about twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>And he entered into the synagogue and spoke boldly for three months, debating and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some became hardened and disbelieving, speaking evil against the Way before the multitude, he withdrew from them and separated the disciples, each day debating in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>Now this took place for two years, so that all who were dwelling in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so that even handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin were brought to those who were sick, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>Then some of the wandering Jews, exorcists, attempted to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those having the evil spirits, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul preaches."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>Now there were seven sons of Sceva, a Jewish high priest, doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the evil spirit answered and said, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize; but who are you?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>Then the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped upon them, and having subdued them, prevailed against them, so that they ran out of the house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>Now this became known to all both Jews and Greeks who were dwelling in Ephesus; and fear fell upon them all, and they were praising the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many of those who had believed were coming, confessing and disclosing their deeds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>And many of those who were practicing magic brought together their books and burned them up before everyone. And they counted up the prices of them, and [found it to be] fifty thousand [pieces] of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>Thus the word of the Lord was growing powerfully and prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>When these things were fulfilled, Paul resolved in his spirit, having gone through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And having sent to Macedonia two of those who were ministering to him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed on for a time in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>Now there arose during that time a serious disturbance concerning the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a certain man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, providing no little trade [for] the craftsmen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>whom he gathered, with the workers of similar occupation, and said: "Men, you know out of this trade is our prosperity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>And you observe and hear that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all of Asia, this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great multitude, saying that they are not gods which are made by human hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>And not only is this business of ours in danger to come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be despised and also her magnificence, about to be destroyed, she whom all Asia and the world worship."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And hearing [this], and becoming full of anger, they were crying out saying, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the whole city was filled with confusion, and they rushed with one purpose into the theater, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>Now when Paul wished to enter in among the crowd, the disciples would not permit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And also some of the officials of Asia, being friends with him, sent word to him and urged him not to present himself in the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Then others were calling out something different, for the assembly was confused, and the majority did not know for what reason they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And from the crowd they brought forward Alexander, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander motioned with his hand, and desired to make a defense to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But recognizing he was a Jew, there arose one voice from [them ]all, calling out for two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>And having quieted the crowd, the city clerk said: "Men of Ephesus, for what man is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is the temple keeper of the great goddess Artemis, and of the [image ]fallen from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Therefore, since these things are undeniable, it is necessary for you to be quieted and to do nothing rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For you brought these men, neither temple thieves nor blasphemers of your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>Therefore, if Demetrius and his fellow craftsmen have a word against anyone, the courts are in session, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if you are wanting to know anything about other [matters], it shall be determined by the lawful assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For we also are in danger of being accused of insurrection concerning today, there being no cause for which we will be able to give, [as ]an explanation for this commotion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>Now after the disturbance had ceased, Paul, summoning the disciples and greeting them, went away to go to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And going through those parts, and encouraging them with many words, he came to Greece</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>and spent three months [there]. And as a plot by the Jews developed against him, as he was to put to sea for Syria, a decision came about to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And Sopater, a Berean, was accompanying him to Asia-also Aristarchus of the Thessalonians, and Secundus, and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus, [the] Asians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These [men], having gone ahead, were waiting for us in Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>And we sailed away after the Days of Unleavened Bread, from Philippi, and we came to them in Troas within five days, where we spent seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>Now on the first [day] of the week, the disciples being assembled to break bread, Paul was discussing with them, being about to leave on the next day, and extended his message until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>And there were a considerable number of lamps in the upper room where we were assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain young man named Eutychus sat in the window, being overwhelmed by a deep sleep. While Paul was speaking for a while longer, having been overwhelmed by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>But Paul, going down, fell upon him, and embracing him said, "Do not be troubled, for his life is in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>And going up and breaking bread and eating, and talking for a considerable time, until daybreak, thus he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they brought the boy living, and they were encouraged greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>Now we, having gone ahead on the ship, put to sea for Assos, from there intending to take Paul on board; for thus it had been arranged, since he intended to go on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>And when he met us at Assos, having taken him aboard, we came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>And having sailing away from there, on the next day we arrived opposite Chios. The following day we approached to Samos and remained in Trogyllium. The following day we came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, in order that it might not happen to him to spend time in Asia; for he was hurrying, if it was possible for him to be in Jerusalem [on] the Day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>Now from Miletus, having sent to Ephesus, he summoned the elders of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And when they were present with him, he said to them: "You know from the first day which I arrived in Asia, how I was with you the whole time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears and trials which happened to me by the plots of the Jews;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>how I kept back nothing that was profitable, but declared it to you, teaching you publicly and from house to house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>solemnly bearing witness to both Jews and to Greeks, the repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now behold, I, having been bound in the spirit, am going to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>except that the Holy Spirit in every city is solemnly bearing witness, saying that bonds and tribulations are waiting for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I count myself as nothing; nor do I regard my life as valuable to myself, so that I may complete my course with joy, and the ministry which I received from the Lord Jesus, to bear solemn testimony to the gospel of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And now behold, now I know that you all, among whom I have passed through preaching the kingdom of God, will no longer see my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>Therefore I testify to you this very day, that I am innocent of all blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>For I did not draw back from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Therefore take heed to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit placed you [as ]overseers, to shepherd the church of the Lord, and of God, which He purchased with His own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>For I know this, that savage wolves will come in after my departure, not sparing the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>Also from among you yourselves will arise men speaking things having been distorted, [in order] to draw away the disciples after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years, night and day I did not cease, with tears, exhorting each one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>So for the present, I entrust you, brothers, to God and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>I have desired the silver or gold or clothes of no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>You yourselves know that these hands rendered service to my needs, and those who were with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>By all things I have shown you, that thus laboring it is necessary to help [those] being weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that He said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And having said these things, he knelt down, together with them all, and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And there was considerable weeping by all, and falling on Paul's neck, they kissed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>feeling pain most of all for the words which he said, that they were about to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>Now when it came to pass that we had put to sea, having withdrawn from them, running a straight course we came to Cos, and on the next [day] to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, we boarded it and put to sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>When we had sighted Cyprus, and had left it behind [on the ]left, we sailed to Syria, and put in to harbor in Tyre, for the ship was unloading its cargo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And having discovered disciples, we stayed there seven days. They said to Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>But when it came about that we had completed the days [there], having gone out we departed, all [of them] accompanying us, together with [their ]wives and children, until [we were] outside the city. And having bowed [our] knees on the shore, we prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>And having greeted one another, we went up into the ship, and they returned to their own [homes].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And completing our voyage from Tyre, we arrived in Ptolemais, and having greeted the brothers, we stayed one day with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>On the next day those accompanying Paul went forth and came to Caesarea, and entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, we stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And while we remained there several days, a certain prophet from Judea named Agabus came down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>And coming to us and taking Paul's belt, and binding his feet and hands, he said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, ' The man whose belt this is, the Jews will bind in this way in Jerusalem, and they will deliver [him] into the hands of the Gentiles.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>Now when we heard these things, both we and the local residents urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>Then Paul answered, "Why are you weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be bound, but also to die at Jerusalem, for the name of the Lord Jesus."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And when he remained unpersuaded, we were silent and said, "Let the will of the Lord be done."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>Now after those days, having prepared, we went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>Also some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us and brought with them a certain Cypriot named Mnason, a long-standing disciple, with whom we would stay as a guest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>And when we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers gladly received us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>On the next day Paul was going in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And having greeted them, he reported one by one those[ ]things which God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And hearing this, they were glorifying the Lord, saying to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are who have believed, and they are all zealous for the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>and they have been informed about you, that you are teaching defection from Moses, to all the Jews who are among the Gentiles, saying for them not to circumcise their children nor to walk in our customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What then? It is necessary for an assembly to come together; for they will hear that you have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Therefore do this, which we say to you: There[ ]are four men with us who have taken a vow upon themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take them and purify yourself with them, and pay for them that they may have their head shaved, and that all may know that those things of which they have been informed about you are nothing, but [that] you are agreeing with and keeping the law yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>But as for the Gentile believers, we wrote, having judged that they should keep no such thing, except that they should keep themselves from things offered to idols, from blood, and [from anything] strangled, and from fornication."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul, having taken the men, on the next day having been purified with them, entered into the temple, [thus] giving notice to the completion of the days of the purification, until [the time] when the offering was offered in behalf of each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>Now when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, were stirring up all the crowd and put their hands on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying out, "Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who is teaching all [people] everywhere against the people and the Law and this place; and furthermore he has brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And all the city was aroused; and there was a mob forming among the people, and taking hold of Paul they were dragging him outside the temple; and immediately the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And seeking to kill him, a report went up to the commander of the garrison that all Jerusalem had been stirred up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>who immediately having taken along soldiers and centurions, ran down among them. And when they saw the commander and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>And the commander, approaching, took hold of him, and ordered him to be bound with two chains; and he was inquiring who he might be and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>But others among the crowd were crying out one thing and some another; and because he was unable to ascertain the truth because of the noise, he commanded him to be brought into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>But when he arrived at the stairs, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>For the multitude of the people was following, calling out, "take him away!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>Then as Paul was about to be led into the barracks, he said to the commander, "Is it permitted from me to speak to you?"And he said, "Do you know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Are you not then the Egyptian who rose up before these days, and led forth the four thousand men of the assassins into the wilderness?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, "I am a Jew from Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city; and I request of you, permit me to speak to the people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And permitting him, Paul stood on the stairs and motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great silence, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>"Men, brothers and fathers, hear my defense to you now."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And hearing that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they granted [him ]more silence. And he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>"I am indeed a Jew, having been born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but having been brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, having been educated according to the exactness of the law of our forefathers, being zealous for God just as you all are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>I, who persecuted this Way to death, binding and handing over to prisons both men and women,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as also the high priest testifies of me, along with the council of the elders, from whom I also received letters to the brothers, and went to Damascus in order to bring those who were there, having been bound, to Jerusalem, that they might be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>Now it happened, as I was going and approaching Damascus, about midday, suddenly from heaven a great light shone about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>"So I answered, 'Who are You, Lord?' And He said to me, 'I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom you are persecuting.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>"And those who were with me observed the light and became terrified, but they did not hear the voice of the [One] speaking to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>So I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Arise and go into Damascus, and it will be told to you about all the[ ]things which it has been appointed for you to do.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>"And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, being led by the hand by those who were with me, I came into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And Ananias, a certain devout man according to the law, being testified of by all the Jews dwelling in Damascus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came to me and he stood and said to me, 'Brother Saul, see again.' And I, in that very hour, looked up at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, 'The God of our fathers has chosen you to know His will, and to see the Righteous One, and hear the voice from His mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>For you shall be a witness for Him to all men of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now, what are you going to do? Arise and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>"And it happened to me, having returned to Jerusalem and praying in the temple, that I came to be in a trance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and saw Him saying to me, 'Hurry and go out quickly from Jerusalem, for they will not receive your witness about Me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>"And I said, 'Lord, they know that in every synagogue I was imprisoning and beating those believing on You.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And when the blood of Your witness Stephen was shed, I myself was standing by consenting to his murder, and guarding the clothes of those murdering him.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>"Then He said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>Now they were listening to him until this statement, and they lifted their voice saying, "Take away such a [man] from the earth, for it is not fitting [for] him to live!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And as they were crying out and throwing off their clothes, and throwing dust in the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the commander ordered him to be brought into the barracks, and said for him that he should be given a hearing with scourging, so that he might learn why they were crying thus against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>But as they were stretching him out with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion standing there, "Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman, and uncondemned?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And the centurion, hearing this, going to the commander he reported, saying, "Watch what you are about to do, for this man is a Roman."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>Then the commander came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman?"He said, "Yes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>And the commander answered, "I acquired this citizenship with much money."And Paul said, "But I was born [a citizen]."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Then immediately those who were about to interrogate him withdrew from him; and even the commander was afraid, having learned he was a Roman, and that he had bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>Now on the next day, desiring to know the truth [as to] why he was accused by the Jews, he released him from the bonds, and ordered the chief priests and their whole council to come, and brought Paul down and presented [him] to them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>Then Paul, looking intently at the council, said, "Men, brothers, I have lived with all good conscience toward God until this day."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>But the high priest Ananias commanded those standing by him to strike his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said to him, "God is about to strike you, you whitewashed wall! For you sit judging me according to the law, and contrary to the law do you command that I should be struck?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>But those standing by said, "Do you revile the high priest of God?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Then Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he is the high priest; for it is written, 'You shall not speak wickedly of a ruler of your people.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But when Paul perceived that one part was of the Sadducees and the other of the Pharisees, he cried out in the Sanhedrin, "Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of a Pharisee; concerning the hope and resurrection of the dead I am being judged!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he had spoken this, there came to be a dispute between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection-nor angel nor spirit; but the Pharisees confess both.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there came to be a great outcry, and the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, saying, "We find no evil in this man; but if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him, let us not fight against God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And when much dissension developed, the commander, fearing lest Paul might be torn apart by them, commanded the detachment of soldiers to go down and seize him from the midst of them, and to bring [him] into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>Now on the next night the Lord stood by him and said, "Take courage, Paul; for as you solemnly testified about the things concerning Me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>Now when it was day, some of the Jews joined in a conspiracy and bound themselves by a curse, saying neither would they eat nor drink until they would kill Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And there were over four hundred who had made this plot;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>who came to the chief priests and to the elders and said, "We have bound ourselves by oath with a curse to taste nothing until we kill Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now you, therefore, together with the council, suggest to the commander that he be brought down to you tomorrow, as though you are going to determine more accurately the things concerning him; but we, before he comes near, are prepared to kill him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But when Paul's sister's son heard about the ambush, he came and entered into the barracks, and told [this] to Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paul, summoning one of the centurions and said, "Lead this young man away to the commander, for he has something to tell him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>Therefore taking him along, he brought him to the commander and said, "The prisoner Paul, having summoned me, asked me to bring this young man to you, for he has something to say to you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the commander, taking him by his hand, withdrew to a private place and inquired, "What is it that you have to tell me?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask that tomorrow you bring Paul down to the Sanhedrin, as though they are going to learn something more accurate concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>Therefore you [must] not be persuaded by them; for more than four hundred of them are lying in wait for him, who have bound themselves by a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they kill him; and now they are prepared, waiting for the promise from you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>Then the commander dismissed the young man, and commanded him, "Tell no one that you have made known these things to me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And having summoned two of the centurions he said, "Make ready two hundred soldiers, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen, in order that they may go to Caesarea, to leave at the third hour of the night;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>and place mounts at [their] disposal, in order that they may put Paul on them, and bring him safely to Felix the governor."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>And he wrote a letter which contained this content:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias, to the most excellent governor Felix: Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man, having been arrested by the Jews, was about to be killed by them. I came upon [them] with the detachment of soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And desiring to know the cause for which they were accusing him, I took him down to their council;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>and I found that he was accused concerning questions of their law, [but] had no accusation [against him] worthy of death or chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And when it became known to me that a plot against the man by the Jews was about to happen, I sent him at once to you, and also commanded the accusers to state the charges against him before you. Farewell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>Then the soldiers, as they were commanded, took Paul and brought him during the night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>And on the next day they left the horsemen to go on with him, and returned to the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>When they entered into Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, [they] also presented Paul to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And when the governor read the letter, he asked what province he was from. And learning that he was from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said, "I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive."And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's Praetorium.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>Now after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders and a certain attorney named Tertullus, who made known to the governor the charges against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And when he had been called, Tertullus began to accuse [him], saying: "Attaining much peace by you and successes coming about for this nation by your foresight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>both in everything and everywhere we accept [it], most excellent Felix, with all thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But that I not weary you any longer, I beseech you to hear us briefly in your graciousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For [we] have found this man [to ]be a plague, and [one] causing discord among all the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the Nazarenes sect,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>who also attempted to profane the temple, whom we also arrested,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.7'>- - -</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>from whom you will be able, having judged [him] yourself, to learn about all these things of which we are accusing him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also joined in the attack, asserting that these things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>But Paul answered (the governor, having nodded for him to speak): "Knowing that you have been a judge of this nation for many years, the more cheerfully I defend the things concerning myself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>because you being able to know that it has not been more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>And they did not find me with anyone in the temple disputing, or inciting a crowd to rise up, neither in the synagogues nor in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>Nor are they able to prove [against ]me the things about which they are now accusing me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But I confess this to you, that according to the Way which they call a sect, so I worship the God of my fathers, believing in all things which are written throughout the Law and in the Prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>having hope in God, which even they themselves are waiting for, that there is going to be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and the unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>And in this I myself am engaging, having a conscience blameless toward God and men through everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>And after many years I arrived to bring alms and offerings to my nation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>among whom some Jews from Asia found me, having been purified in the temple, not with a crowd nor with turmoil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>who ought to be present before you and to make accusation if anything they might have against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me, when I stood before the council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>unless it is because of this one statement which I cried out, standing among them, 'Concerning the resurrection of the dead I am being judged by you today.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>And when he heard these things, Felix adjourned them, knowing more accurately the things[ ]concerning the Way, and said, "When Lysias the commander comes down, I will decide your case."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>And ordering the centurion to keep watch over Paul and to let him have some liberty, and not to forbid [any] of his own to serve or to come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>Now after some days, when Felix arrived with Drusilla his wife, who was Jewish, he sent for Paul and heard him concerning the faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he reasoned about righteousness, self-control, and the judgment which is going to be, Felix became afraid and answered, "Go away for now; but when I have opportunity I will summon you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>Meanwhile he also hoped that money would be given him by Paul, that he might release him. Therefore sending for him more often, he was conversing with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But after two years had passed, Felix received Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desiring to grant favors to the Jews, left Paul in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Now when Festus had set foot in the province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from Ceasarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>And the high priest and the prominent men of the Jews made known to him the case against Paul; and they were appealing to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking for favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem-while planning an ambush to kill him along the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>But Festus answered that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he was about to go there shortly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>"Therefore,"he said, "the prominent men among you, let them go with me and accuse this man, if there is anything in this man."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And when he had stayed among them more than ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day, sitting on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious accusations against Paul, which they were not able to prove,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>while he defended himself, [saying,] "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar did I commit any sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, desiring to grant a favor to the Jews, answered Paul and said, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem and there be judged before me concerning these things?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul said, "I am standing before the judicial bench of Caesar, by whom it is necessary [for] me to be judged. I have done no wrong to the Jews, as also you know very well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>For if I am doing wrong, and have done anything worthy of death, I am not trying to escape a death sentence; but if there is nothing in these things of which these [people] are accusing me, no one is able to deliver me to them. I appeal to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, having talked together with the council, answered, "Have you appealed to Caesar? Before Caesar you shall go!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>And after some days King Agrippa and Bernice arrived in Caesarea and greeted Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And as he was spending many days there, Festus laid before the king the charges against Paul, saying: "There is a certain man who was left a prisoner by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>about whom the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed me, when I was in Jerusalem, asking for punishment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To them I answered, 'It is not a custom with Romans to deliver any man to destruction before the [one] being accused may meet his accusers face to face, and may receive an opportunity for defense concerning the charge.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>"Therefore when they had assembled here, having made no delay, on the next day I took my seat at the judicial bench, and I commanded the man to be brought [in];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>concerning whom, when the accusers stood, they brought no accusation of the[ ]things which I was supposing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but had some questions against him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who had died, whom Paul affirmed to be living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And being uncertain [as to] the investigation concerning this, I asked whether he was willing to go to Jerusalem and there be judged concerning these charges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But when Paul appealed that he be kept for the decision of His Majesty the Emperor, I commanded him to be kept until I may send him to Caesar."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I also was wishing to hear the man myself.""Tomorrow,"he said, "you shall hear him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>Therefore on the next day, when Agrippa and Bernice had come with all pomp, and had entered into the auditorium together with the commanders and the prominent men of the city, and when Festus had commanded, Paul was brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus said: "King Agrippa and all the men who are with us, observe this man about whom the people of the Jews petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, crying against [him] that it is not fitting [for] him to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But when I came to understand him to have done nothing worthy of death, and also he had appealed to His Majesty the Emperor, I decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>About whom I have nothing certain to write to my lord. Therefore I have brought him before you, and especially before you King Agrippa, in order that when this hearing is finished I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seems unreasonable to me to send a prisoner and not to signify the accusations against him."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, "It is permitted for you to speak for yourself."So Paul, having extended his hand, spoke in his own defense:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>I have considered myself fortunate, King Agrippa, being able to speak in my own defense today, concerning all the things of which I am accused of by the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>especially since you are well versed both in all the customs and questions in relation to the Jews; therefore I beg you to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>Therefore my way of life from my youth, which from the beginning was spent among my own nation in Jerusalem, all the Jews know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>since they have known me for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now for the hope of the promise having been made by God to the fathers, I stand before you judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>[a promise] to which our twelve tribes, as they earnestly serve God night and day, hope to attain. Concerning which hope I am accused by [the] Jews, King Agrippa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it considered [such ]an unbelievable thing by you [people ]if God raises the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>Therefore I thought in myself that it was necessary to do many hostile things against the name of Jesus the Nazarene;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>which also I did in Jerusalem, and many of the saints I shut up in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were being put to death, I cast my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And I punished them often in all the synagogues, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly enraged against them, I persecuted them even as far as to foreign cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>"In which [pursuits] also, as I traveled to Damascus with authority and commission from the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at midday, O king, along the road I saw a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, shining around me and those traveling with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And when we all had fallen down to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me and saying in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>"So I said, 'Who are You, Lord?' And He said, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But arise and stand on your feet; for I have appeared to you, to appoint you a minister and a witness both [of the things] which you have seen, and [of the things] which I will yet reveal to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>delivering you from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes, in order to turn them from darkness to light, and from the authority of Satan to God, [in order for ]them to receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified by faith in Me.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>"Therefore, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but to those first in Damascus and in Jerusalem, and throughout all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, proclaiming that they must repent and turn to God, and do works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>Because of these things the Jews arrested me in the temple and attempted to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Therefore, having obtained help from God, until this day I stand, witnessing both to common [people] and great [people], saying nothing except the things which both the prophets and Moses spoke of as being about to happen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the Christ was to suffer, that as the first to rise from the dead, He was about to proclaim light to the Jewish people and to the Gentiles."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>Now as he spoke these things, Festus said with a loud voice, "You are mad, Paul! Your higher learning is driving you to madness!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But he said, "I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I boldly declare words of truth and reason.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king knows about these things, to whom also I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things escapes his notice, since this thing was not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>"Do you believe the prophets, King Agrippa? I know that you believe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>And Agrippa said to Paul, "In a short time, you are persuading me to become a Christian!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul said, "I would pray to God, both in a short time and a long time, not only you, but also all who are hearing me today, would become such as I am, except for these chains."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>When he had said these things, the king stood up, as well as the governor and Bernice and those sitting together with them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>and when they withdrew, they were speaking among themselves, saying, "This man practices nothing worthy of death or chains."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>Then Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been released if he had not appealed to Caesar."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>Now when it was decided that we should sail away to Italy, they handed over both Paul and certain other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the Augustan Regiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And having boarded a ship of Adramyttium, scheduled to sail to the ports along the Asian coasts, we put to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And from there having put to sea, we sailed under the sheltered side of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And having sailed across the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we docked at Myra, in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And there the centurion found an Alexandrian ship sailing to Italy, and he put us aboard in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And sailing slowly many days, and with difficulty arriving down off Cnidus, since the wind would not permit us to go on, we sailed under the sheltered side of Crete, down off Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>And with difficulty sailing past it, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the city of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>Now when much time had been spent, the voyage having already become dangerous, because the Fast had already gone by, Paul recommended,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>saying to them, "Men, I perceive this voyage is going to be with hardship and much loss, not only of the cargo and of the ship but also our lives."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion was persuaded by the helmsman and the ship owner, rather than by the things being said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And because the harbor was not suitable to winter in, the majority gave counsel to put to sea from there, if perhaps they might be able to get to Phoenix to spend the winter there, a harbor of Crete opening toward the southwest and to the northwest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And when a south wind blew gently, supposing they had attained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along close in shore to Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long after, a head wind like a hurricane arose, called [a ]Euroclydon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>and when the ship was seized by it, and not being able to face into the wind, we were being driven along, [having ]given in [to the wind.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And running under the sheltered side of a certain little island called Clauda, we secured the skiff with difficulty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>And having hoisted it up, they used cables for undergirding the ship; and being afraid lest they run aground in the Syrtes [Shallows], they let down the driving anchor, thus they were being driven along [by the wind.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And because we were exceedingly tempest-tossed, the next day they lightened the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And on the third day we threw off the equipment of the ship with our own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>And neither the sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small storm pressed on us, finally all hope for us to be saved was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>Now when they had abstained from food for a long time, then stood Paul in the midst of them and said, "Men, you should have followed my advice and not put to sea from Crete, and to spare [yourselves ]this hardship and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>And now I urge you to keep up [your] courage, for there will be loss of not one life among you, only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For there stood by me this night an angel of the God to whom I belong, whom also I serve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; for it is necessary for you to stand before Caesar; and behold, God has granted you all those sailing with you.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>"Therefore keep up your courage, men; for I believe God that it will be in the very manner it has been spoken to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>However, it is necessary [for] us to run aground on a certain island."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>Now when it was the fourteenth night, as we were driven about in the Adriatic Sea, in the middle of the night the sailors sensed that land was approaching them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>And having taken a sounding, they found it to be twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little farther, they took soundings again and found it to be fifteen fathoms;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>and being afraid lest we should run aground on the rocks, they threw out four anchors from the stern, and were praying for day to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>Now as the sailors were seeking to flee from the ship, and letting down the skiff into the sea, in pretense of spreading out anchors from the prow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "If these men do not remain in the ship, you cannot be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the skiff and let it fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And until the [time] was about to be day, Paul was urging them all to receive their share of food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day you continue waiting without eating, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore I urge you to take food, for this is for your deliverance; for not a hair from your head shall fall."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And having said these things and having taken bread, he gave thanks to God in the presence of all, and having broken it, he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>And they all became cheerful and also took food themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>And in all we were two hundred and seventy-six persons on the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And having eaten enough, they began lightening the ship and throwing out the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>Now when it became day, they did not recognize the land; but they noticed a certain bay which had a beach, on which they resolved, if possible, to run the ship ashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And casting off the anchors, they were leaving them in the sea, meanwhile loosening the ropes of the rudders; and having raised the mainsail to the wind, they began steering toward the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But they struck a reef and ran the vessel aground, and the prow became stuck and remained unmoved, but the stern was being broken up by the violence of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And the soldiers' decision was that they would kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, wanting to rescue Paul, hindered them in their intention, and commanded that those who were able to swim to jump down first to go toward the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and the rest, some on boards and others on parts from the ship. And in this way it came about that all were brought to safety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And when they were rescued, then they learned that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the natives were showing us extraordinary kindness; for having kindled a fire they accepted us all into [their] society, because of the rain which had begun, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>But when Paul had gathered a large bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper having come out because of the heat, fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the natives saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "Certainly this man is a murderer, whom though he was rescued from the sea, justice does not permit to continue living."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>Then, having shaken off the creature into the fire, he suffered nothing harmful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>And they were expecting him to be about to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But after they had waited for a long time and observed nothing unusual happening to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>Now in the areas around that place were pieces of land [belonging] to the leading citizen of the island, named Publius, who welcomed us, and received us hospitably as guests for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>And it came to pass that the father of Publius lay sick of a fever and dysentery, to whom Paul came in and prayed, and laying his hands on him, healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>Then after this happened, also the rest who were ill on the island were coming to him and were being healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>who also honored us with many honors, and when we put to sea, they gave us the things that we needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>Now after three months we put to sea in a ship that had wintered on the island, [belonging] to Alexandria, with the figurehead of the Twin Brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And putting in to harbor at Syracuse, we stayed there three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>from where having sailed around we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day arose a south wind, on the second day we came to Puteoli,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where having found brothers, we were urged by them to stay for seven days; and so we came to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And from there the brothers, when they heard about our circumstances, they came to meet with us as far as Appii Forum and Three Inns, whom when Paul saw, he gave thanks to God and took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>Now when we came to Rome, the centurion handed over the prisoners to the captain of the guard; but Paul was allowed to stay by himself with the soldier guarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And it came to pass after three days that Paul called together those who were prominent among the Jews; and when they had come together, he said to them: "Men, brothers, though I have done nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers, yet I was handed over as a prisoner from Jerusalem, into the hands of the Romans,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, when they had examined me, were wanting to release me because there was no cause for my case.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But when the Jews spoke in opposition, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar, not that I had anything of which to accuse my nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>Therefore for this reason I have requested you, to see and to speak to you, for because of the hope of Israel I am wearing this chain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>Then they said to him, "We neither received letters from Judea concerning you, nor have any of the brothers who arrived report or speak anything evil about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we request to hear from you the[ ]things which you think; for concerning this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And having appointed for him a day, many came to him at his house, to whom he was explaining and solemnly testifying to the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things concerning Jesus from both the Law of Moses and from the Prophets, from morning till evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some were persuaded by the things being said, but others refused to believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And being in disagreement with one another, they went away after Paul had said one word: "The Holy Spirit spoke rightly through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying, 'Go to this people and say: "Hearing you will hear, and by no means understand; and seeing you shall see, and by no means perceive;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For the hearts of this people has become dull. Their ears are hard of hearing, and their eyes have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and they should hear with their ears, lest they should understand with their heart and turn back, so that I should heal them."'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>"Therefore let it be known to you that the salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear it!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>And when he had said these things, the Jews went away, having a great dispute among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>Then Paul remained two full years in his own rented house, and he was receiving all those who were coming to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>preaching the kingdom of God and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.1'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.1'>Paul, a bondservant of Jesus Christ, called [to be ]an apostle, having been separated unto the gospel of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>which He promised beforehand through His prophets in the Holy Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>concerning His Son, who came of [the] seed of David according to the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>who was declared Son of God with power according to the Spirit of holiness by the resurrection of [the] dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>through whom we received grace and apostleship for [the ]obedience of faith among all the nations for His name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>among whom you also are the called of Jesus Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>To all those who are in Rome, beloved of God, called [to be] saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for you all, that your faith is spoken of throughout the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of His Son, that without ceasing I make mention of you always in my prayers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>requesting if somehow now at sometime I shall succeed in the will of God to come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>For I long to see you, so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift, that you may be established-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>that is, that I may be encouraged together with you through the mutual faith both of you and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, that often I planned to come to you (and I was hindered until now), that I might have some fruit among you also, just as among the other Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>I am a debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to [the ]wise and to [the ]unwise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>So, as much as is in me, I am eager to preach the gospel to you who are in Rome also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>For I am not ashamed of the gospel of Christ, for it is the power of God unto salvation to everyone that believes, both to the Jew first and to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>For in it [the] righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith; as it is written, "The just shall live by faith."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven upon all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>Because that which is known of God is manifest in them, for God has shown [it] to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>For the invisible things of Him from the creation of[ ]the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things made, both His eternal power and divinity, so that they are without excuse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>Because, having known God, they did not glorify [Him] as God, or give thanks, but became vain in their reasonings, and their foolish heart was darkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.22'>Asserting themselves to be wise, they became fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>and changed the glory of the incorruptible God for a likeness of an image of corruptible man and of birds and four-footed animals and reptiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>Therefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of the own hearts, to dishonor their own bodies among themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>who exchanged the truth of God for the lie, and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>For this reason God gave them up to shameful lusts, for even their women exchanged the natural use for that which is contrary to nature,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>and likewise also the men, having forsaken the natural use of the woman, were inflamed by their lust for one another, men with men, committing what is shameful, and receiving in themselves the recompense which was fitting for their error.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>And just as they did not approve to have God in their knowledge, God gave them up to a reprobate mind, to do the things which are not fitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>having been filled with all unrighteousness, fornication, wickedness, greed, malice; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness; they are whisperers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>slanderers, haters of God, insolent men, proud, braggarts, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>without understanding, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>who, having known the righteous judgment of God, that those practicing such things are worthy of death, not only do them, but also approve of those who practice them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>Therefore you are inexcusable, O man, everyone who judges, for in whatever you judge another you condemn yourself, for you who judge are practicing the same things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>But we know that the judgment of God is according to truth upon those practicing such things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>But do you suppose this, O man, you who judge those practicing such things yet doing them, that you will escape the judgment of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>Or do you despise the riches of His kindness and tolerance and patience, not knowing that the kindness of God leads you to repentance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>But according to your hardness and impenitent heart you are storing up for yourself wrath in the day of wrath and revelation, and of the righteous judgment of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>who will recompense to each one according to his works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>to those who by the endurance of good works are seeking glory and honor and incorruption-eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>But to those who are contentious, and who disobey the truth, but obey unrighteousness-indignation and wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>tribulation and anguish, upon every soul of man that works evil, of the Jew first and also of the Greek;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>but glory, honor, and peace to everyone that works good, both to the Jew first and to the Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>For there is no partiality with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>For all who have sinned without the law shall also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law shall be judged by the law</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>(for [it is ]not the hearers of the law [who ]are righteous before God, but the doers of the law shall be justified;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>for whenever Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, these, not having the law, are a law unto themselves,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>in the day when God shall judge the secrets of men according to my gospel through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>Behold, you are called a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast in God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>and know His will, and approve the things that are more excellent, being instructed out of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>and are convinced that you are a guide to the blind, a light to those in darkness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of the immature, having the embodiment of knowledge and of the truth in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>You, therefore, who teach another, do you not teach yourself? You who preach that a man should not steal, do you steal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>You who say, "Do not commit adultery,"do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you commit sacrilege?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>You who boast in the law, do you dishonor God through the transgression of the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>For "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you,"just as it is written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>For indeed circumcision profits if you keep the law; but if you are a transgressor of the law, your circumcision has become uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>Therefore, if an uncircumcised man keeps the righteous requirements of the law, will not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>And will not the physically uncircumcised, who keeps the law, judge you along with your written [code] and circumcision, as a lawbreaker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>For he is not a Jew who is one outwardly, nor is circumcision that which is outward in flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>but he [is] a Jew that [is one] inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in [the] spirit, not in [the ]letter, whose praise is not from men but from God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>What then [is] the superiority of the Jew, or what is the profit of circumcision?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>Much in every way! First of all, that they were entrusted with the [very ]words of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>For what if some did not believe? Will their unbelief nullify the faithfulness of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>By no means! Indeed, let God be true but every man a liar, just as it is written: "That You may be justified in Your words, and You may prevail when You are judged."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>But if our unrighteousness demonstrates the righteousness of God, what shall we say? [Surely] God, the [One ]inflicting wrath is not unrighteous, is [He]? (I speak as a man).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>By no means! For otherwise how shall God judge the world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>For if by my lie the truth of God has abounded to His glory, why am I also still judged as a sinner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>And why not say, "Let us do evil so that good may come"?-just as we are slandered, and just as some affirm that we say. [The] judgment of whom is just.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>What then? Are we [any] better? Not at all. For we previously charged both Jews and Greeks that they are all under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>Just as it is written: "There is none righteous, no not one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>There is none who understands; there is none who seeks God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>All [have ]turned aside; together they became unprofitable; there is not [one] doing kindness, there is not so much as one."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>"Their throat is an opened grave; with their tongues they deceived"; "[the ]poison of asps is under their lips";</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>Their feet are swift to shed blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>Ruin and misery are in their ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>And the way of peace they did not know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>There is no fear of God before their eyes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>Now we know that as many things as the law says, it speaks to those under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become guilty before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>Therefore by works of the law no flesh shall be justified in His sight, for through the law [comes] [the] knowledge of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>But now the righteousness of God apart from the law has been revealed, being witnessed to by the Law and the Prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>even the righteousness of God, through [the] faithfulness of Jesus Christ, to all and upon all those that believe. For there is no distinction;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>whom God set forth as a propitiation through faith in His blood, for a demonstration of His righteousness through the passing over of the sins having previously committed, in the forbearance of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>for a demonstration of His righteousness in the present time, that He might be just and the justifier of he who has [the] faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>Where then is the boasting? It is excluded. Through what law? Of works? No, but through the law of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith apart from works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>Or is He the God of the Jews only? But is He not also the God of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>since there is one God who will justify [the ]circumcision by faith, and the uncircumcised through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>Therefore do we nullify the law through faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold [the] law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>What then shall we say that Abraham our father has found according to the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>For if Abraham was justified by works, he has [grounds for] boasting, but not before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>Now to him who works, his wage is not reckoned as a gift, but as his due.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>But to him who does not work but believes on Him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>just as David also speaks of the blessing of the man to whom God credits righteousness apart from works:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>"Blessed [are] [they] whose lawless deeds have been forgiven, and whose sins have been covered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>Blessed is the man to whom the LORD shall by no means impute sin."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>Does this blessing then come upon the circumcision, or also upon the uncircumcised? For we say that faith was credited to Abraham as righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>How then was it credited? While he was circumcised, or in uncircumcision? Not in circumcision, but in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>And he received the sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the faith which [he had while ]in uncircumcision, so that he should be the father of all those that believe, although uncircumcised, so that righteousness should also be imputed to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>and the father of circumcision to those not only of circumcision, but also to those following in the steps of the faith which our father Abraham[ had while] in uncircumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>For the promise that he should be heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through [the] law, but through [the] righteousness of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>For if those who are of [the] law are heirs, faith is made void and the promise has been nullified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>because the law produces wrath; for where there is no law neither is there transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>Therefore it is of faith that it may be according to grace, so that the promise might be sure to all the seed, not only to those[ ]of the law, but also to those of the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>(just as it is written, "I have appointed you a father of many nations") before God, whom he believed, the [One] who gives life to the dead and calls those things which are not as though they were;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>who, contrary to hope, on hope believed, so that he should become a father of many nations, according to what was spoken, "So shall your descendants be."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>And not weakening in faith, he did not consider his own body, already having been worn out (being about a hundred years old), and the deadness of Sarah's womb,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>he did not waver at the promise of God in unbelief, but was empowered by faith, giving glory to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>and being fully convinced that what He had promised He was also able to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>And therefore "it was credited to him as righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>Now it was not written for his sake alone that it was credited to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>but for us also, to whom it was going to be credited, those believing on Him who raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>who was delivered up for our transgressions, and was raised for our justification.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>Therefore, having been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>through whom we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>And not only that, but we also rejoice in tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces endurance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>and endurance, character; and character, hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>And hope does not put to shame, because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>For while we were still weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.7'>For scarcely on behalf of a righteous [man] will anyone die; yet perhaps for a good man someone might even dare to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.8'>But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.9'>Much more then, having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from wrath through Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.10'>For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more, having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.11'>And not only that, but we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom now we received the reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.12'>Therefore, just as through one man sin entered the world, and death through sin, and thus death passed to all men, because all sinned-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.13'>(For until the law sin was in the world, but sin is not imputed when there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.14'>Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin according to the likeness of the transgression of Adam, who is a type of Him who was to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.15'>But the free gift is not like the transgression. For if by the transgression of the one man many died, much more the grace of God and the gift by the grace of the one Man, Jesus Christ, abounded to the many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>And the gift is not as by one having sinned. For the judgment [which came] from one [transgression resulted] in condemnation, but the free gift from many offenses [brought ] justification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.17'>For if by the transgression of the one man death reigned through the one [man], much more those receiving the abundance of the grace and of the gift of righteousness will reign in life through the One, Jesus Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>So then, as through one [man's] transgression [judgment came] to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one [Man's] righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.19'>For through the disobedience of the one man the many were constituted sinners, so also through the obedience of the One many shall be constituted righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.20'>But [the] law came in alongside, so that the offense might abound. But where sin abounded, grace superabounded,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.21'>so that just as sin reigned in death, so also grace might reign through righteousness to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.1'>What shall we say then? Shall we go on sinning so that grace may abound?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.2'>By no means! We died to sin-How shall we live any longer in it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.3'>Or do you not know that as many [of us] as were baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.4'>Therefore we were buried with Him through baptism into death, so that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we also should walk in newness of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.5'>For if we have been united together in the likeness of His death, certainly we shall also be [in the likeness] of [His] resurrection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.6'>knowing this, that our old man was crucified [with Him], so that the body of sin may be done away with, [that] we should no longer serve sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.7'>For he who has died has been justified from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.8'>But if we died with Christ, we believe that we also shall live together with Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.9'>knowing that Christ, having been raised from the dead, no longer dies. Death is no longer master [over] Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.10'>For what [death] He died, He died to sin once for all; but what [life] He lives, He lives to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.11'>Likewise you also, consider yourselves to be dead indeed to sin, but alive to God in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.12'>Therefore do not let sin reign in your mortal body, that you should obey it in its lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.13'>nor present your members as instruments of unrighteousness to sin, but present yourselves to God as being alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.14'>For sin shall not be master over you, for you are not under law but under grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.15'>What then? Shall we sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.16'>Do you not know that to whom you present yourselves as obedient slaves, you are slaves to whom you obey, whether of sin [resulting] in death, or of obedience [resulting] in righteousness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.17'>But thanks be to God, that though you used to be slaves of sin, yet you obeyed from [your] heart that form of doctrine to which you were delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.18'>And having been freed from sin, you became enslaved to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.19'>I speak in human terms on account of the weakness of your flesh. For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness, and to lawlessness [resulting] in [more] lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness [resulting] in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.20'>For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.21'>So what fruit did you have then of which [things] you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.22'>But now having been freed from sin, and having become enslaved to God, you have your fruit [resulting] in sanctification, and the end, eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.6.23'>For the wages of sin [is] death, but the gift of God [is] eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.1'>Or do you not know, brothers (for I speak to those knowing the law), that the law has jurisdiction over a man as long as he lives?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.2'>For the woman who is under a man has been bound by law to the living husband. But if the husband should die, she is released from the law of the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.3'>So then, while the husband is living, she will be called an adulteress if she becomes [married] to a different husband; but if her husband should die, she is free from the law, so that she is not an adulteress, having become [married] to a different husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.4'>Therefore, my brothers, you also were put to death to the law through the body of Christ, that you may be married to another-to Him who was raised from the dead, so that we might bear fruit to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>For when we were in the flesh, the sinful passions aroused through the law were at work in our members to bear fruit to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>But now we were released from the law, having died in [that] to which we were held fast, so that we should serve as slaves in the newness of the Spirit and not in the oldness of the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.7'>What shall we say then? Is the law sin? By no means! On the contrary, I would not have known sin except through the law. For I would not have known lust unless the law had said, "You shall not covet."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.8'>But sin, taking opportunity through the commandment, produced in me every kind of lust. For apart from the law sin [was] dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.9'>For I was alive apart from the law once, but when the commandment came, sin revived, but I died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.10'>And the commandment, which [was] to [bring] life, I found to [bring] death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.11'>For sin, taking opportunity by the commandment, deceived me, and by it, killed me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.12'>Therefore the law indeed is holy, and the commandment holy and righteous and good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.13'>Then has that which is good become death to me? By no means! But sin, that it might appear sin, was producing death in me through that which is good, so that sin through the commandment might become exceedingly sinful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.14'>For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal, having been sold under sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.15'>For what I am doing, I do not know. For what I want to do, I do not do; but what I hate, this I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.16'>But if I do what I do not want to do, I agree with the law that [it is] good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.17'>But now [it is] no longer I [who] am doing it, but the sin living in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.18'>For I know that in me (that is, in my flesh) nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but [how] to do the good, I do not find.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.19'>For the good that I want to do I do not do; but the evil I do not want to do, this I practice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.20'>But if I do what I do not want to do, it is no longer I [who] do it, but the sin living in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.21'>Therefore I find this law, that [when] I wish to do the right[ thing], evil is right there with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.22'>For I delight in the law of God in my inner being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.23'>But I see a different law in my members, waging war against the law of my mind, and capturing me by the law of sin which is in my members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.24'>O wretched man that I am! Who shall deliver me from this body of death?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.25'>I thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself with the mind serve the law of God, but with the flesh the law of sin.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.1'>[There is] therefore now no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus, who do not walk according to the flesh, but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.2'>For the law of the Spirit of life in Christ Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.3'>For what [was] impossible [for] the law to do in that it was weak through the flesh, God [did] by sending His own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh, and concerning sin, He condemned sin in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.4'>so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.5'>For those who are fleshly set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those [who live] according to the Spirit, the things of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.6'>For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the Spirit is life and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.7'>Because the mind set on the flesh is hostile toward God; for it does not submit to the law of God, nor indeed can it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.8'>And those that are in the flesh cannot please God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.9'>But you are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. But if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not His.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.10'>But if Christ is in you, the body indeed is dead because of sin, but the Spirit is alive because of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.11'>But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit indwelling in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.12'>Therefore, brothers, we are debtors-not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.13'>For if you live according to the flesh you shall die; but if by [the] Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.14'>For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.15'>For you did not receive the spirit of bondage again unto fear, but you received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, "Abba, Father."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.16'>The Spirit Himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.17'>And if children, then heirs-heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, if indeed we suffer together, so that we may also be glorified together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.18'>For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy [to be compared] with the coming glory to be revealed in us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.19'>For the earnest expectation of the creation eagerly awaits the unveiling of the sons of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.20'>For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but on account of Him who subjected it in hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.21'>because even the creation itself shall be freed from the slavery of corruption into the freedom of the glory of the children of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.22'>For we know that all the creation groans together and labors in birth together until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.23'>And not only that, but also [we ]ourselves having the firstfruits of the Spirit, even we ourselves groan within ourselves, eagerly waiting adoption, the redemption of our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.24'>For by this hope we were saved, but hope that is seen is not hope; for why does one still hope for what he[ ]sees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.25'>But if we hope for what we do not see, we eagerly await it with endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.26'>Likewise the Spirit also helps in our weaknesses. For we do not know what we should pray for as we ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with inexpressible groanings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.27'>But He that searches the hearts knows what the mind of the Spirit is, because He intercedes on behalf of the saints according to [the will] [of] God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.8.32'>He who did not spare His own Son, but gave Him up on behalf of us all, how shall He not with Him also freely give us all things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.33'>Who shall bring an accusation against God's elect? It is God who justifies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.34'>Who is he that condemns? Christ is the [One] having died, but rather also having been raised, who is even at [the] right [hand] of God, who also intercedes on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.8.35'>Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.9.18'>So then He has mercy on whom He wills, and whom He wills He hardens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.19'>You will say to me then, "Why does He still find fault? For who can resist His will?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.20'>But indeed, O man, who are you to [be ]answering back against God? Shall the thing formed say to him who formed it, "Why have you made me like this?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.21'>Or does not the potter have the right over the clay, from the same lump to make one vessel for honor and the other for dishonor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.22'>But what if God, wanting to show His wrath and to make His power known, endured with much longsuffering the vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.23'>and so that He might make known the riches of His glory on the vessels of mercy, which He had prepared beforehand for glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.24'>even us whom He called, not only of the Jews, but also of the Gentiles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.25'>As also in Hosea He says: "I will call those My people who were not My people, and her beloved, who was not beloved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.26'>"And it shall be in the place where it was said to them, 'You are not My people,' there they shall be called sons of the living God."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.27'>Isaiah also cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the sons of Israel were as the sand of the sea, the remnant shall be saved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.28'>For He is finishing and cutting short an account in righteousness, because the LORD will make a short account upon the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.29'>And just as Isaiah foretold: "If the LORD of hosts had not left us a seed, we would have become like Sodom, and would have resembled Gomorrah."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.30'>What shall we say then? That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness, have attained righteousness, even the righteousness of faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.31'>but Israel, pursuing a law of righteousness, did not attain to the law of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.32'>Why? Because [they did] not [seek it] by faith, but rather by the works of the law. For they stumbled at that stone of stumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.9.33'>Just as it is written: "Behold, I lay in Zion a stone of stumbling and rock of offense, and everyone believing on Him will not be put to shame."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rom.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.1'>Brothers, the good pleasure of my heart and my supplication to God on behalf of Israel, is for [their] salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.2'>For I testify concerning them, that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.3'>For they, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.4'>For Christ is the end of [the] law for righteousness to everyone that believes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.5'>For Moses writes about the righteousness which [is] of the law, "That the man who does those things shall live by them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.6'>But the righteousness of faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who shall ascend into heaven?' "(that is, to bring Christ down)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.7'>or, "'Who shall descend into the abyss?' "(that is, to bring up Christ from the dead).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.8'>But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart"(that is, the word of faith which we proclaim):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.9'>that if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and you believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.10'>For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.11'>For the Scripture says, "Whoever believes on Him shall not be put to shame."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.12'>For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek, for the same Lord of all is rich to all who call on Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.13'>For "whosoever shall call upon the name of the LORD shall be saved."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.14'>How then shall they call on Him in[ ]whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear apart from a preacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.15'>And how shall they preach unless they are sent? Just as it is written: "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the gospel of peace, of those preaching the gospel of good things!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.16'>But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed our report?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.17'>So then faith [comes] by hearing, and hearing by [the] word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.18'>But I say, have they not heard? Yes, indeed [they have]: "Their voice went out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.19'>But I say, did Israel not know? First Moses says: "I will provoke you to jealousy by [those who are] not a nation, by a foolish nation I will anger you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.20'>But Isaiah is very bold and says: "I was found by those who did not seek Me; I was made manifest to those who did not ask for Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.10.21'>But to Israel he says: "the whole day long I have stretched out My hands to a disobedient and obstinate people."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.11'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.1'>I say then, has God cast away His people? By no means! For I too am an Israelite, of the seed of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.2'>God has not cast away His people whom He foreknew. Or do you not know [what the Scripture says] in Elijah, how he pleads with God against Israel, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.3'>"LORD, they killed Your prophets and they torn down Your altars, and I alone am left, and they are seeking my life"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.4'>But what does the divine response say to him? "I have reserved for Myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.7'>What then? Israel has not obtained what it seeks; but the elect have obtained [it], and the rest were blinded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.8'>Just as it is written: "God has given them a spirit of stupor, eyes that they should not see, and ears that they should not hear, down to this very day."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.11'>I say then, have they stumbled that they should fall? By no means! But by their transgression, salvation [has come] to the Gentiles, to provoke them to jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.12'>But if their transgression is [the] riches of the world, and their defeat is [the] riches of the Gentiles, how much more their fullness!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.13'>For I speak to you Gentiles; inasmuch as I am indeed an apostle to the Gentiles, I glorify my ministry,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.15'>For if their casting away means reconciliation [for the] world, what will their acceptance be, if not life from the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.16'>For if the firstfruit is holy, [so] also the lump; and if the root is holy, so also the branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.17'>But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, being a wild olive tree, were grafted in [among] them, and became a partaker of the root and of the fatness of the olive tree,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.19'>You will say then, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.20'>That is true. By unbelief they were broken off, but you stand by faith. Do not be arrogant, but fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.21'>For if God did not spare the natural branches, perhaps He may not spare you either.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.22'>Behold then the kindness and severity of God: upon those that fell, severity; but upon you, kindness, if you continue in His kindness. Otherwise you also shall be cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.23'>And they also, if they do not remain in unbelief, shall be grafted in, for God is able to graft them in again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.24'>For if you were cut out of the olive tree which is wild by nature, and were grafted contrary to nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more shall these, the natural ones, be grafted into their own olive tree?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.25'>For I do not want you to be unaware of this mystery, brothers, lest you be wise in your own opinion, that blindness in part has happened to Israel until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.11.26'>And so all Israel shall be saved, as it is written: "The Deliverer shall come out of Zion, and He shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.11.30'>For just as you once were disobedient to God, but now you were shown mercy through their disobedience,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.12.3'>For I say, through the grace given to me, to everyone who is among you, not to think of himself too highly, beyond what you should think, but to think soberly, as God has imparted to each one a measure of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.4'>For just as we have many members in one body, but all the members do not have the same function,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.12.5'>so we, [being] many, are one body in Christ, and individually members of one another.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.13.3'>For rulers are not a fear to good works, but to evil. And do you wish not to fear the authority?[ ]Do what is good, and you shall have praise from the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.4'>For he is God's servant to you for good. But if you do evil, fear; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is God's servant, an avenger for wrath to the [one] practicing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.5'>Therefore it is necessary to be subject, not only on account of wrath, but also for conscience' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.13.6'>For on account of this you also pay taxes, for they are ministers of God, always giving attention to this very thing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rom.15.22'>For this reason I also have been hindered many times from coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.23'>But now no longer having a place in these regions, and having a longing to come to you for many years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.24'>whenever I travel to Spain, I shall come to you. For I hope [while] traveling through to see you, and to be sent forward there by you, if I may be filled in part [from] you first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.25'>But now I am traveling to Jerusalem ministering to the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.26'>For Macedonia and Achaia thought it good to make some contribution for the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.27'>For they thought it good, and they are their debtors. For if the Gentiles shared in spiritual things, they are obligated also to minister to them in material things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.28'>Therefore, having finished and having sealed to them this fruit, I shall go by way of you to Spain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.29'>But I know that coming to you, I shall come in the fullness of the blessing of the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.30'>Now I beg you, brothers, through the Lord Jesus Christ, and through the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in prayers to God on my behalf,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.15.31'>that I may be delivered from those in Judea who do not believe, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>to the church of God which is at Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called [to be] saints, with all those who in every place are calling on the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always on your behalf for the grace of God which was given to you in Christ Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>that in everything you were enriched by Him in all speech and all knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>just as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>so that you are not lacking in any gift, eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>who will also confirm you until the end, [that you may be] unimpeachable in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I beseech you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but you be made complete in the same mind and in the same opinion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it has been reported to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of Chloe's household, that there is quarreling among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now I say this, that each of you says, "I am of Paul,"and "I[ ]of Apollos,"and "I[ ]of Cephas,"and "I of Christ."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Has Christ been divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>lest anyone should say that I had baptized in my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>Yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas. Besides, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not in eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ should be deprived of its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the message of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written: "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the understanding of the prudent I will annul."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the philosopher of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through wisdom did not know God, God was well pleased, through the foolishness of our preaching, to save those that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For Jews request a sign, and Greeks seek after wisdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>but we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumbling block, and to the Greeks foolishness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For you see your calling, brothers, that not many wise according to the flesh, not many powerful, not many noble, [are called].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God chose the foolish things of the world in order that He might humiliate the wise, and God chose the weak things of the world in order that He might humiliate the mighty[.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And the lowly things of the world, and the despised things God has chosen, and the things which are not, in order that He might nullify the things which are,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>so that no man may boast before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But from Him you are in Christ Jesus, who became for us wisdom from God, and righteousness and sanctification and redemption;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>that, as it is written, "He that boasts, let him boast in the LORD."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brothers, when I came to you, did not come with excellence of speech or of wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness, in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my message and my preaching [were] not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>in order that your faith might not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>However, we speak wisdom among those that are mature, but not the wisdom of this age, nor of the rulers of this age, who are being destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, the [wisdom] having been hidden, which God foreordained before the ages for our glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>which none of the rulers of this age understood (for had they understood, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory).</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written: "Eye has not seen, nor ear heard, nor have entered into the heart of man, the things which God has prepared for those who love Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God has revealed [them] to us through His Spirit. For the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For who among men knows the things of a man, except the spirit of the man which is in him? Even so, no one knows the things of God except the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we did not receive the spirit of the world, but the Spirit which is from God, in order that we might know the things freely given to us by God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>which things we also speak, not in words taught in human wisdom, but in words taught by the Holy Spirit, comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; nor can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he that is spiritual discerns all things, yet he himself is discerned by no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For "Who has known the mind of the LORD, that he may instruct Him?"But we have the mind of Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brothers, was not able to speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I gave you milk to drink, and not solid food; for you were not yet able [to receive it]. Indeed, neither are you now yet able;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>for you are still carnal. For where there are envy, strife, and divisions among you, are you not carnal, and walking according to human principles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For when one says, "I am of Paul,"and another, "I [am] of Apollos,"are you not carnal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers through whom you believed, as the Lord has given to each one?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I planted, Apollos watered, but God gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, and each one will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are coworkers with God; you are God's field, you are God's building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which was given to me, as a wise architect I have laid the foundation, but another builds on it. But let each one take heed how he builds on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For no other foundation can anyone lay, other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if anyone builds on this foundation [with] gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>each one's work shall be made manifest; for the Day shall reveal it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall test each one's work, as to what sort it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If anyone's work which he has built remains, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If anyone's work is burned up, he shall suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, but so as through fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God shall destroy him. For the temple of God is holy, which [temple] you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you seems to be wise in this age, let him become a fool, that he may become wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their craftiness";</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>and again, "The LORD knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are useless."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no one boast in men. For all things are yours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas, or the world or life or death, or things present or things to come-all things[ ]are yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>And you are of Christ, and Christ is of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so consider us, as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Now furthermore what is required among the stewards, is that one be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But to me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by a human court. Indeed, I do not even judge myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I am conscious of nothing, but I have not been justified by this; but He who judges me is the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>So then judge nothing before the time, until the Lord comes, who also will bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will make clear the purposes of the hearts. Then each one's praise shall come from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>Now these things, brothers, I have figuratively applied to myself and Apollos for your sakes, in order that you may learn in us not to think beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up on behalf of one against the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who makes you differ from another? And what do you have that you did not receive? And if you did indeed receive [what you have], why do you boast as though you did not receive it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>You are already full! You are already rich! You have reigned [as kings] without us; and I wish [that] indeed you did reign, in order that we also might reign with you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God has displayed us, the apostles, last, as men appointed to death; for we became a spectacle to the world, both to angels and to men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! You are distinguished, but we are despised!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst, and we are naked, and beaten, and homeless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>And we labor, working with our own hands. Being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>being defamed, we encourage; we have become as the sweepings of the world, the offscouring of all things until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I do not write these things to shame you, but as my beloved children I admonish [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though you might have ten thousand tutors in Christ, yet [you do] not have many fathers; for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I exhort you, be imitators of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>Because of this I sent Timothy to you, who is my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, who will remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach everywhere in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you quickly, if the Lord wills, and I will know, not the word of those who are arrogant, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What do you desire? Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and a spirit of gentleness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is actually heard that there is fornication among you, and such fornication as is not even named among the Gentiles-that a man has his father's wife!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And you have become arrogant, and have not rather grieved, so that he who did this deed would be removed from your midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I indeed, as being absent in body but present in spirit, have already judged (as though I were present) him who has done this deed in this way,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when you are gathered together, along with my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>hand this man over to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, in order that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole batch?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Purge out the old leaven, in order that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are unleavened. For indeed Christ, our Passover, was sacrificed for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>So then let us observe the feast, not with old leaven, nor with the leaven of malice and wickedness, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in my epistle not to associate with fornicators.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>Yet I certainly did not mean with the fornicators of this world, or with the covetous, or swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to leave this world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you not to associate with anyone named a brother, who is a fornicator, or covetous person, or an idolater, or abusive person, or a drunkard, or a swindler-not even to eat with such a person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do with judging those also who are outside? Do you not judge those who are inside?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But those who are outside God will judge. Therefore "put away the evil person from yourselves."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Does any of you, having a matter against another, dare go to court before the unrighteous, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world will be judged by you, are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Do you not know that we will judge angels? Let alone ordinary [matters]!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then you have ordinary lawsuits, do you appoint those who are disdained within the church [to judge?]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I say [this] to your shame. So is there not among you a wise [man], not even one, who will be able to judge between his brother [and another]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goes to court against brother, and that before unbelievers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Actually then, it is already a defeat for you that you have lawsuits against one another. Why not rather accept wrong? Why not rather accept being defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But you wrong and defraud, and these things [to your] [own ]brothers!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the[ ]things of which you wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Nevertheless, to avoid fornication, let each [man] have his own wife, and let each [woman] have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render to his wife the affection due her, and likewise also the wife to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.4'>The wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband [does]. And likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife [does].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.5'>Do not deprive one another, except by mutual agreement, [and that] for a season, so that you may devote yourselves to fasting and prayer; and come together again, lest Satan tempt you because of your lack of self-control.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.6'>But I say this as a concession, not as a commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.7'>For I wish that all men would be as I myself. But each one has his own gift from God, one in this way and another in that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.8'>But I say to the unmarried and to the widows: It is good for them if they should remain as I also [remain];</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.9'>but if they are not exercising self-control, let them marry. For it is better to marry than to burn [with passion].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.10'>Now to those who have married I command, yet not I, but the Lord: A wife is not to be separated from her husband-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.11'>and even if she does separate, let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband-and a husband is not to divorce his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.12'>But to the rest I, not the Lord, say: If any brother has an unbelieving wife, and she consents to live with him, let him not divorce her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.13'>And a wife who has an unbelieving husband, if he consents to live with her, let her not divorce him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.14'>For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified by the husband; otherwise your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.15'>But if the unbelieving [spouse] separates, let [him or her ]separate; the brother or the sister has not been bound in such cases; but God has called us to peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.16'>For how do you know, O wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, O husband, whether you will save your wife?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.17'>Otherwise as God has distributed to each one, as the Lord has called each one, so let him walk. And so I command in all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.18'>Was anyone called while circumcised? Let him not become uncircumcised. Was anyone called while uncircumcised? Let him not be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.19'>Circumcision is nothing and uncircumcision is nothing, but keeping the commandments of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.20'>Let each one remain in the same calling in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.21'>Were you called as a slave? Do not be concerned about it; but if you can be made free, rather make use of [it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.22'>For he who is called in the Lord while a slave is the Lord's free [man]. Likewise he who is called as a free [man] is Christ's slave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.23'>You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.24'>Brothers, let each one remain with God in [the state] in which he was called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.25'>Now concerning virgins, I have no command of the Lord; but I give judgment, as having received mercy by the Lord to be faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.26'>Therefore I consider this to be good because of the present distress, that [it is] good for a man to be as he is:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.27'>Have you been bound to a wife? Do not seek to be released. Have you been released from a wife? Do not seek a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.28'>But even if you should marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin should marry, she has not sinned. But such will have trouble in the flesh, and I would spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.29'>But this I say, brothers, the time has been shortened; so that from now on even those having wives should be as though they had none,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.30'>and those weeping as though not weeping, and those rejoicing as though not rejoicing, and those buying as though not possessing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.31'>and those using this world as not using it up. For the form of this world is passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.32'>But I want you to be without anxiety. The unmarried man cares about the things of the Lord-[about ]how he may please the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.33'>But the [man] having married cares about the things of the world-[about ]how he may please his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.34'>And the wife and the virgin are different. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But the woman having married cares about the things of the world-about how she may please her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.35'>And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a snare upon you, but for that which is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.36'>But if any man thinks he is behaving improperly toward his virgin, if she is past her youth, and thus it must be, let him do what he desires. He does not sin; let them marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.37'>But [he] who stands in his heart, not having necessity, but has power over his own desire, and has decided this in his heart that he will keep his virgin, does well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.38'>So then he who gives her in marriage does well, but he who does not give her in marriage does better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.39'>A wife has been bound by law as long as her husband lives; but if her husband also dies, she is free to be married to whom she desires, only in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.40'>But she is more blessed if she remains as she is, in my opinion-and I think I also have the Spirit of God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.9'>But beware lest somehow this liberty of yours become a stumbling block to those who are weak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.8.10'>For if anyone should see you who has knowledge dining in an idol's temple, will not his conscience, being weak, be strengthened so that they eat foods offered to idols?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.28'>But let a man examine himself, and in this way let him eat from the bread and drink from the cup.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.29'>For he that eats and drinks irreverently eats and drinks judgment to himself, not judging correctly the body of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.30'>Because of this many among you are weak and sick, and many have died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.31'>For if we judge ourselves correctly, we would not be judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.32'>But when we are judged, we are disciplined by the Lord, in order that we may not be condemned along with the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.33'>Therefore, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.11.34'>But if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home, lest you come together for judgment. And the rest I will put in order when I come.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.1'>Now concerning spiritual [gifts], brothers, I do not want you to be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>You know that when you were pagans, how you were led, being carried away to these speechless idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>Therefore I make known to you that no one speaking by the Spirit of God says "Jesus be cursed,"and no one can say that Jesus [is] Lord except by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>Now there are varieties of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>And there are varieties of ministries, but the same Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>And there are varieties of activities, but the same God works all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>But to each [one] the manifestation of the Spirit is given for the profit [of all.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>For to one is given a word of wisdom through the Spirit, to another a word of knowledge according to the same Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>and to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healings by the same Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>to another the working of miracles, and to another prophecy, and to another discerning of spirits, and to another [different] kinds of tongues, and to another interpretation of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>But one and the same Spirit works all these things, distributing to each one individually just as He wills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>For just as the body is one and has many parts, but all the parts of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body-whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free-and we were all given to drink into one Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>For in fact the body is not one part but many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I am not of the body,"is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I am not of the body,"is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If the whole body [were] an eye, where [would be] the hearing? If the whole [were] hearing, where [would be] the smelling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But now God has set the parts, each one of them, in the body just as He desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>And if all [parts ]were one part, where [would be] the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now indeed there[ are] many parts, but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>And the eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you"; nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>But to a greater degree the parts of the body which seem weaker are necessary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And [the parts] of the body which we consider to be less honorable, on these we bestow greater honor; and our unpresentable parts have greater propriety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>But our presentable [parts] have no need. But God united the body, giving greater honor to the [part] being inferior,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>lest there be divisions in the body, but the parts care the same for one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one part suffers, all the parts suffer together; or if one part is honored, all the parts rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now you are the body of Christ, and members individually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And [those] whom God has appointed in the church [are]: first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, administrations, kinds of tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>All [are] not apostles, [are they]? All [are] not prophets, [are they]? Are all teachers? [Are] all [workers of] miracles?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Do all have gifts of healings? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But strive for the better gifts. And yet I make known a more excellent way.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I have become [as] sounding brass or a clashing cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And though I have [the gift of] prophecy, and know all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>Now we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when that which is perfect has come, then that which is partial shall pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I thought as a child, I reasoned as a child; but when I became a man, I put away the things of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>For now we see through a mirror by reflection, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I shall know just as I also am known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>And now abide faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Pursue love, and desire the spiritual [gifts], but especially that you may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he who speaks in an [unknown] tongue speaks not to men, but to God, for no one understands him; however, in the spirit he speaks mysteries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he who prophesies speaks edification and exhortation and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He who speaks in an [unknown] tongue edifies himself, but he who prophesies edifies the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>Now I wish you all spoke in tongues, but even more that you should prophesy; for he who prophesies is greater than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, so that the church may be edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>But now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, what shall I profit you unless I speak to you either in a revelation, or in knowledge, or in a prophesy, or in doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>Likewise the lifeless things, when they make a sound, whether flute or harp, unless they make a distinction in the tones, how will it be known what is being played on the flute, or what is being played on the harp?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For if the trumpet gives an indistinct sound, who will prepare for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So also you, [if you] do not give a clear word by the tongue, how will it be known what is being spoken? For you will be speaking into the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, perhaps, so many kinds of sounds in the world, and none of them without meaning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore, if I do not know the meaning of the sound, I shall be as a foreigner to the [one ]speaking, and the [one] speaking [shall be] as a foreigner to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>So also you, since you are zealous of spiritual [gifts], seek that you may abound to the edification of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let he that speaks in an [unknown] tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is the conclusion then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will also pray with the mind. I will sing with the spirit, and I will also sing with the mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Otherwise, if you bless with the spirit, how will he who occupies the place of the uninformed say "Amen"when you give thanks, since he does not know what you are saying?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For you indeed give thanks well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank my God I speak with tongues more than you all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>but in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding, in order that I may instruct others, rather than ten thousand words in an [unknown] tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brothers, do not be children in your understanding; rather, in malice be children, but in understanding be men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written: "With men of other tongues and by strange lips I will speak to this people; and yet not even in this way will they hear Me,"says the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>So then tongues are for a sign, not to those who believe but to unbelievers; but prophesying is not for unbelievers but for those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If then the whole church comes together at the same place, and all speak in tongues, and there come in [those that are] unlearned or unbelievers, will they not say that you are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or an unlearned person comes in, he is reproved by all, he is discerned by all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>And so the secrets of his heart become clear; and so, falling down on his face, he will worship God, reporting that God is truly among you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>What is it then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each of you has a song, has a teaching, has a tongue, has a revelation, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If anyone speaks in an [unknown] tongue, [let it be ]by two or at the most three, each in turn, and let one interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, let him be silent in church, and let him speak to himself and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let two or three prophets speak, and let others discriminate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>But if [something] is revealed to another who sits by, let the first be silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For you can all prophesy [one] by one, that all may learn and all may be encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not [the author] of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>let your women be silent in the churches, for it is not permitted for them to speak, but to be in subjection, just as the law also says.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is shameful for women to speak in church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>Or did the word of God go forth from you? Or did it come to you only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or [is] spiritual[,] let him recognize that the things which I am writing to you are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if anyone is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Therefore, brothers, seek to prophesy, and do not forbid to speak in tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done properly and according to order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Now I made known to you, brothers, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which you also stand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>through which also you are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you-unless you believed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received: that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>and that He was buried, and that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>and that He appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>Thereafter He appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, of whom the majority remain until now, but some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>Thereafter He appeared to James, then to all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>And last of all, as of [one] born out of due time, He appeared to me also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than them all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is vain and your faith also is vain!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>And we are found [to be ]false witnesses of God, because we bore witness concerning God, that He raised Christ, whom He did not raise-if in fact the dead are not raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead are not raised, [then] neither has Christ been raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is worthless; you are still in your sins!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then also those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are to be pitied above all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now Christ has been raised from the dead, [and] has become the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since by a man [came] death, also by a Man came the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ all will be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But each one in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then those who belong to Christ at His coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then [will be] the end, when He hands over the kingdom to God, even the Father, when He abolishes every ruler and every authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For He must reign until He puts all His enemies under His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy that will be abolished is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For "He has subjected all things under His feet."But when He says that "all things have been subjected,"it is evident that [this is] except for Him who subjected all things to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>Now when all things are made subject to Him, then also the Son Himself will be subjected to Him who subjected all things to Him, in order that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Otherwise, what will they do who are being baptized for the dead, if the dead are not raised at all? Why are they also baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why are we also in danger every hour?</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Awake to righteousness, and do not sin! For some have no knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But someone will say, "How are the dead raised? And with what sort of body do they come?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Fool, what you sow is not made alive unless it dies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And what you sow, you do not sow that body that will be, but a bare grain-perhaps wheat or some other [grains].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God gives to it a body just as He desired, and to each of the seeds its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh, but there is a different [kind] [of flesh] for men, and another flesh for beasts, another for fish, and another for birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>And there[ are ]heavenly bodies, and earthly bodies; but the glory of the heavenly is one, and the glory of the earthly is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for one star differs from [another] star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead. The body is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>Thus also it is written, "The first man Adam [became] a living being;"the last Adam [became] a life-giving spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>However, that which is spiritual is not first, but that which is natural, then that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man [was ]from earth, made of dust; the second Man is the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>Like the [man] made of dust, so also [are] those who are made of dust; and as is the heavenly [Man], so also [are ]those [who are ]heavenly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now this I say, brothers, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; nor can corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I tell you a mystery: We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>So when this corruptible should put on incorruption, and this mortal should put on immortality, then will come to pass the word which was written: "Death was swallowed up in victory."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.7'>For I do not wish to see you now in passing; but I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, to the church of God which is at Corinth, together with all the saints who are in all Achaia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.2'>Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.3'>Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.4'>who comforts us in all our tribulation, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, by means of the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.5'>Because just as the sufferings of Christ abound in us, so our consolation also abounds through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.6'>Now if we are afflicted, it is for your consolation and salvation, which is effective for enduring the same sufferings which we also suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>(And our hope concerning you is steadfast); if we are comforted, it is for your consolation and salvation, knowing that as you are partakers of the sufferings, thus also [you will partake] of the consolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>For we do not desire you to be ignorant, brothers, concerning our affliction which happened to us in Asia: that we were burdened beyond measure, beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>Yes, we have had the sentence of death in ourselves, that we should not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.10'>who delivered us from so great a death, and is delivering [us]; in whom we trust that He will still deliver [us],</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>you also laboring together for us in prayer, that thanks may be given by many persons on your behalf for the gift [given] to us through many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>For our boasting is this: the testimony of our conscience, that we have conducted ourselves in the world in simplicity and godly sincerity, not with fleshly wisdom but by the grace of God, and especially toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>For we do not write other things to you except what you read or also understand. And I hope that you will understand, even until the end</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>just as also you have understood us in part, that we are your boasting, as indeed you also are ours, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.15'>And in this confidence I intended to come to you earlier, that you might have a second benefit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.16'>and through you to pass into Macedonia, and again from Macedonia to come to you, and by you to be sent on to Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.17'>Therefore, when I decided this, did I do it lightly? Or the things I decide, do I decide according to the flesh, that there may be with me "Yes, Yes,"and "No, No?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.18'>But [as ]God [is] faithful, our word unto you was not "Yes and no."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.19'>For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you by us-by me, Silvanus, and Timothy-was not "Yes and no,"but in Him was "Yes."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.20'>For all the promises of God in Him [are] "Yes,"and in Him "Amen,"to the glory of God through us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.21'>Now He who establishes us together with you in Christ and who has anointed us is God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.22'>who also has sealed us, and given us the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.23'>Moreover I call upon God as a witness against my soul, that in order to spare you, I came no more to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.24'>Not that we lord it over your faith, but are fellow workers for your joy; for by faith you stand.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>But I determined this within myself, that I would not come again to you in sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.2'>For if I make you sorrowful, then who is he who makes me glad if not the [one] which is made sorrowful by me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote this very thing to you, lest when I came, I should have sorrow from those from whom I ought to have joy, having confidence in you all that my joy is [the joy] of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>For out of much affliction and distress of heart I wrote to you, through many tears, not that you might be made sorrowful, but that you might know the love which I have more abundantly towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>Now if anyone has caused grief, he has not grieved me, but in part-lest I burden you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient to such a person is this punishment which was [inflicted] by the majority,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that, on the contrary, you ought rather to forgive and comfort him, lest somehow such a person be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Therefore I appeal to you to reaffirm [your] love towards him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>For to this end I also wrote, so that I might put you to the test, [to see] if you are obedient in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>And to whom you forgive anything, I also [forgive;] for if indeed I have forgiven anything, [the ]one whom I have forgiven, [I have done so] for your sakes in the presence of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>lest we be taken advantage of by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Now when I came to Troas for the gospel of Christ, and a door was opened to me by the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>I had no rest in my spirit, because I did not find Titus my brother; but saying farewell to them, I departed for Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>Now thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, and making known through us the fragrance of His knowledge in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>For we are the fragrance of Christ to God among those being saved, and among those perishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>To some we are the fragrance of death [leading] to death, but to others the fragrance of life [leading] to life. And who is sufficient for these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>For we are not as the rest, corrupting the word of God; but as of sincerity, but as from God, we speak in the sight of God in Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we begin again to commend ourselves? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or [letters] of recommendation from you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.2'>You are our letter, having been written in our hearts, being known and being read by all men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>being made known that you are [the] letter of Christ, which was ministered by us, having been written not with ink but by the Spirit of the living God, not in tablets of stone but in tablets of flesh, [namely] in hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>And we have such trust through Christ toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to consider anything as from ourselves, but our sufficiency is from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also has made us efficient as ministers of the new covenant, not of [the] letter but of [the] Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit makes alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>Now if the ministry of death, having been engraved in letters on stones, came to be with glory, so that the sons of Israel could not look intently into the face of Moses because of the glory of his countenance, the [glory which] [was] passing away,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how will the ministry of the Spirit not be more glorious?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.9'>For if the ministry of condemnation [had] glory, the ministry of righteousness exceeds much more in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.10'>For even that which has been glorified has not been glorified in this respect, because of the surpassing glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.11'>For if that which passes away [was] glorious, then that which remains is much more glorious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Therefore, having such hope, we use great boldness of speech-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and not as Moses, who put a veil over his face so that the sons of Israel could not look intently at the end of what was passing away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.14'>But their minds were blinded. For until this day the same veil remains unlifted in the reading of the Old Testament, because the veil is removed in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.15'>But even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.16'>But whenever one turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.17'>Now the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord [is], there is freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.18'>But we all, with unveiled face, beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, just as by the Spirit of the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.1'>Therefore, since we have this ministry, as we received mercy, we do not despair,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.2'>but we have renounced the hidden things of shame, not walking in craftiness nor falsifying the word of God, but by the disclosure of the truth, commending ourselves to every man's conscience before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>But even if our gospel is hidden, it is hidden among those who are perishing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>among whom the god of this age has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, so that the illumination of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God, should not shine on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.5'>For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus the Lord, and ourselves your bondservants for Jesus' sake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.6'>Because it is God who commanded light to shine out of darkness, who shined in our hearts to give [the] light of the knowledge of the glory of God in [the] face of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.7'>But we have this treasure in clay vessels, so that the extraordinary character of the power may be of God and not of us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.8'>in everything being oppressed, yet not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.9'>persecuted, but not abandoned; cast down, but not destroyed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.10'>always carrying about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, so that also the life of Jesus may be revealed in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.11'>For we who are living are always handed over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifest in our body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.12'>So then death is working in us, but life in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.13'>And since we have the same spirit of faith, according to that which is written, "I believed, and therefore I spoke,"we also believe, therefore we also speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.14'>knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us through Jesus, and will present us together with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.15'>For all things[ are] for your sakes, that grace, having spread through the many, may cause thanksgiving to abound to the glory of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.16'>Therefore we do not despair, but even if our outward man is being destroyed, yet the inward man is being renewed day by day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.17'>For our momentary light affliction is working out for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.18'>while we do not look at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen. For the things which are seen are for a season, but the things which are not seen last forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.1'>For we know that if our earthly house, this tent, is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made by hand, eternal in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.2'>For also in this we groan, earnestly desiring to be clothed with our habitation which is from heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.3'>if indeed, having been clothed, we shall not be found naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.4'>For we who are in this tent groan, being burdened, inasmuch as we do not desire to be stripped, but to put on [clothing], that that which is mortal may be swallowed up by life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.5'>Now He who has prepared us for this same thing is God, who also gave to us the down payment of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.6'>Therefore always being confident, and knowing that while we are in the body, we are away from home from the Lord</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.7'>(for we walk by faith, not by sight),</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.8'>but we are confident and prefer rather to be away from home from the body, and to be at home with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.9'>Therefore also we have as our ambition, whether being at home, or being away from home, to be well pleasing to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.10'>For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done in the body, in accordance with the things which he did, whether good or bad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.11'>Knowing, therefore, the fear of the Lord, we persuade men; but we have been made known to God. And I also hope to have been made known in your consciences.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.12'>For we do not commend ourselves again to you, but give to you an opportunity of boasting on our behalf, so that you may have [an answer] for those who boast in appearance and not in heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.13'>For if we were beside ourselves, it [was] for God; or if we are of sound mind, [it is] for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.14'>For the love of Christ compels us, having concluded this: that if One died for all, then all died;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.15'>and He died for all, so that they who live should live no longer for themselves, but for the [One] who died for them and rose again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.16'>Therefore, from now on, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know [Him thus] no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.17'>Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation; the old things passed away; behold, all things have become new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.18'>And all things are of God, who reconciled us to Himself through Jesus Christ, and who gave to us the ministry of this reconciliation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.19'>that is, that God was in Christ reconciling the world to Himself, not reckoning their transgressions to them, and committing to us the word of this reconciliation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.20'>Now then, we serve as ambassadors for Christ, as though God were appealing through us: we implore [you] on Christ's behalf, be reconciled to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.5.21'>For He made Him who knew no sin to be sin for us, so that we might become the righteousness of God in Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.1'>And working together [with Him,] we also urge that you not receive the grace of God in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.2'>For He says: "In an acceptable time I have heard you, and in the day of salvation I have helped you."Behold, now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.3'>We give no occasion for offense in anything, lest the ministry be blamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.4'>but in everything commending ourselves as ministers of God: in much endurance, in tribulations, in hardships, in distresses,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.5'>in stripes, in imprisonments, in disturbances, in labors, in sleepless nights, in fastings;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.6'>in purity, in knowledge, in longsuffering, in kindness, in the Holy Spirit, in sincere love,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.7'>through the word of truth, through the power of God, through the weapons of righteousness on the right hand and on the left hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.8'>by honor and dishonor, by ill repute and good repute; as deceivers, and yet true;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.9'>as being unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as being disciplined, and not being put to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.10'>as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, and yet possessing all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.11'>O Corinthians! We have spoken openly to you, our heart has been opened wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.12'>You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted by your own affections.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.13'>Now in return for the same-I speak as to children-you also be opened wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.14'>Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what participation is there for righteousness with lawlessness? And what communion is there for light with darkness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.15'>And what agreement is there for Christ with Belial? Or what part is there for a believer with an infidel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.16'>And what union is there for the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God, just as God has said: "I will dwell in them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be My people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.17'>Therefore "Come out from the midst of them and be separated,"says the Lord. "Do not touch what is unclean, and I will receive you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.6.18'>"I will be a Father to you, and you will be My sons and daughters, says the LORD Almighty."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.1'>Therefore, having these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit, perfecting holiness in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.2'>Receive us [in your hearts]. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have defrauded no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.3'>I do not speak to condemn you; for I have said before that you are in our hearts, so that we die together and we live together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.4'>Great is my confidence toward you, great is my boasting concerning you. I have been filled with comfort. I am exceedingly joyful in all our tribulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.5'>For indeed, when we came to Macedonia, our flesh had no rest, but we were afflicted on every side; outside [were] fightings, inside [were] fears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.6'>Nevertheless God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.7'>and not only by his coming, but also by the consolation with which he was comforted over you, as he reported to us your earnest longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced even more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.8'>Because even if I made you sorry in the letter, I do not regret it, even if I did regret it. For I perceive that the same letter made you sorry, though only for a season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.9'>Now I rejoice, not because you were made sorry, but because your sorrow led to repentance; for you were made sorry in a godly manner, that you might suffer loss from us in nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.10'>For godly sorrow produces repentance leading to salvation, without regret; but worldly sorrow produces death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.11'>For behold this very thing, that you sorrowed in a godly manner, how much diligence it produced in you, even an eagerness to defend, even indignation, even fear, even longing, even zeal, even vengeance! In all things you demonstrated yourselves to be pure in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.12'>Therefore, although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of him who did the wrong, nor for the sake of him who was wronged, but so that your diligence on our behalf might be made known to you before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.13'>Because of this we have been comforted. And in your comfort we rejoiced exceedingly more over the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.14'>Because if in anything I have boasted to him concerning you, I was not put to shame, but as we spoke all things to you in truth, thus also our boasting to Titus became truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.15'>And his affections are far greater toward you as he remembers the obedience of you all, how with fear and trembling you received him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.7.16'>[Therefore] I rejoice that in everything I am confident in you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.1'>Now we make known to you brothers, the grace of God which has been given to the churches of Macedonia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.2'>how that in a great trial of affliction the abundance of their joy and their deep poverty abounded in the riches of their generosity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.3'>For I bear witness that according to their ability, and beyond their ability, they were freely willing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.4'>with much appeal, begging us [for ]the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.5'>and not as we hoped, but they first gave their own selves to the Lord, and then to us by the will of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.6'>so that we urged Titus, that just as he had begun before, thus he would also finish this grace also in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.7'>But as you abound in everything-in faith, in word, in knowledge, in all diligence, and in your love for us-see that you abound in this grace also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.8'>I speak not by a command, but I am testing the genuineness of your love by means of the diligence of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.9'>For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though He was rich, yet on account of you He became poor, that you through His poverty might become rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.10'>And I give [my] opinion in this: For this is profitable for you, who not only previously began doing [this], but also desired to, since last year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.11'>And now also complete doing [it]; that as indeed there[ was ]the readiness to desire [it], thus also there[ may be] the completion from what you have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.12'>For if there is first a readiness, it is acceptable according to what one has, and not according to what he does not have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.13'>For I do not [mean] that others should be relieved and you burdened;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.14'>but by way of equality, that now at the present time your abundance [may supply] their need, that their abundance also may supply your need, in order that there may be equality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.15'>As it is written, "He [who ga]there[d] much did not have too much, and he [who gathered] little had no lack."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.16'>But thanks be to God who puts the same earnest care for you in the heart of Titus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.17'>Because he accepted my appeal, but being more diligent, he came to you of his own accord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.18'>And we sent together with him the brother whose praise is in the gospel throughout all the churches,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.19'>and not only that, but who was also chosen by the churches as our traveling companion with this gift, which is ministered by us to the glory of the Lord Himself and [to show] our readiness-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.20'>avoiding this, lest anyone should blame us in this abundance which is ministered by us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.21'>having regard for honorable things, not only before the Lord, but also before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.22'>And we sent together with them our brother whom we often approved in many things, being diligent, but now [being ]much more diligent, by [his] great confidence in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.23'>If [anyone inquires ]about Titus, [he is] my partner and fellow worker concerning you; or if our brothers [are inquired about], [they are] messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.8.24'>Therefore show to them the proof of your love, and of our boasting concerning you, before the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.1'>Now concerning the ministering to the saints, it is unnecessary for me to write to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.2'>for I know your readiness, about which I boast concerning you to the Macedonians, that Achaia has been prepared since last year, and your zeal has provoked the majority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.3'>And I have sent the brothers, lest our boasting about you lose its justification in this matter, that just as I said, you may be prepared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.4'>lest perhaps if [some] Macedonians come with me and find you unprepared, we (not to mention you!) should be ashamed of this confident boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.5'>Therefore I thought it necessary to urge the brothers, that they should go before [me] to you, and should arrange in advance your generous gift, which you had previously promised, [that] this would be ready, thus as a blessing and not as grudgingly given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.6'>But this I say: he who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and he who sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.7'>Let each [one give] just as he decides in his heart, not grudgingly or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful giver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.8'>And God is able to make all grace abound toward you, that in everything always having all sufficiency, you may abound for every good work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.9'>just as it is written: "He has dispersed, He has given to the poor; His righteousness endures forever."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.10'>Now may He who supplies seed to the sower, and bread for food, supply and multiply the seed you have sown and increase the fruits of your righteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.11'>in everything being made rich to all generosity, which produces thanksgiving through us to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.12'>Because the ministry of this service not only is supplying the needs of the saints, but also is abounding through many thanksgivings to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.13'>while through the approved character of this ministry, they glorify God for the obedience of your confession to the gospel of Christ, and [for the] generosity of your sharing toward them and toward all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.14'>and by their prayer for you, who long for you because of the surpassing grace of God in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.9.15'>Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.1'>Now I, Paul, myself appeal to you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ, I who face to face [am] lowly among you, but when I am away am bold toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.2'>But I beseech [you] that when I am present I may not be bold with the confidence with which I plan to be bold toward some, who consider us as walking according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.3'>For though we walk in the flesh, we do not war according to the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.4'>For the weapons of our warfare are not carnal, but mighty by God to the pulling down of strongholds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.5'>casting down imaginations and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the obedience of Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.6'>and being ready to avenge every act of disobedience, whenever your obedience is fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.7'>Do you look at things as they appear? If anyone has persuaded himself that he is Christ's, let him again consider this in himself, that just as he is Christ's, even so we are Christ's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.8'>For even if I should boast somewhat more concerning our authority, which the Lord gave us for edification and not for your destruction, I will not be ashamed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.9'>lest I seem to terrify you by my letters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.10'>"For his letters,"they say, "are severe and boisterous, but his bodily presence [is] feeble, and his speech amounts to nothing."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.11'>Let such a person consider this, that of what sort we are in word by letters when we are absent, of such a kind [we will] also [be] in deed when we are present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.12'>For we dare not to class ourselves or to compare ourselves with those who commend themselves, but they, measuring themselves by themselves, and comparing themselves among themselves, do not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.13'>But we will not boast beyond limits, but according to the measure of the sphere [of influence ]which God assigned us as a measure, to reach even as far as you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.14'>For we are not overextending ourselves, as though our authority did not reach to you, for it was to you that we came with the gospel of Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.15'>not boasting beyond the limits in the labors of others, but having hope, that as your faith is increased, we shall be greatly enlarged by you according to our sphere [of influence],</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.16'>to preach the gospel to the [regions] beyond you, [and] not to boast in the things done in the sphere [of influence] of others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.17'>But "he who boasts, let him boast in the LORD."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.10.18'>For not he who commends himself is approved, but he[ ]whom the Lord commends.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.11'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.1'>Oh, that you would bear with me a little in my foolishness; but indeed you do bear with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.2'>For I am jealous over you with godly jealousy, for I have betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.3'>But I fear, lest perhaps as the serpent deceived Eve by his craftiness, so your minds may be corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.4'>For if he who comes [to you ]preaches another Jesus whom we did not preach, or if you receive a different spirit which you have not received, or a different gospel which you did not accept, you may well put up with him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.5'>For I consider [myself] [in] nothing to have been inferior to the most super apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.6'>But even if I [am] unskilled in speech, yet [I am] not [inferior ]in knowledge, but in every [way] I was made known to you in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.7'>Or did I commit sin in humbling myself in order that you might be exalted, because I preached the gospel of God to you free of charge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.8'>I robbed other churches, taking wages [from them] to minister to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.9'>and when I was present with you, and in need, I did not burden anyone; for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. And in everything I kept myself from being a burden to you, and so I will keep myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.10'>As the truth of Christ is in me, that this boasting will not be silenced in me in the regions of Achaia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.11'>Why? Because I do not love you? God knows!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.12'>But what I am doing, I will also continue to do, that I may cut off the opportunity of those who desire an opportunity, that in what they boast they may be found just as we [are].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.13'>For such are false apostles, deceitful workers, transforming themselves into apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.14'>And no wonder! For Satan himself transforms himself into an angel of light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.15'>Therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also transform themselves into ministers of righteousness, whose end will be according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.16'>Again I say, let no one think me a fool. Otherwise, at least receive me as a fool, that I also may boast a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.17'>What I speak, I speak not according to the Lord, but as it were, foolishly, in this confidence of boasting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.18'>Since many are boasting according to the flesh, I also will boast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.19'>For you bear with fools gladly, being wise [yourselves]!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.20'>For you put up with it if someone enslaves you, if someone devours you, if someone takes from you, if someone exalts himself, if someone strikes you in the face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.21'>To our shame, I say that we were too weak [for that]! But in whatever anyone is bold (I speak foolishly) I am bold also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.22'>Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they the seed of Abraham? So am I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.23'>Are they ministers of Christ? (I speak as a fool) I [am] even more: in labors far more, in beatings immeasurably, in imprisonments far more, in deaths often.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.24'>By [the] Jews five times I received forty stripes minus one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.25'>Three times I was beaten with rods; once I was stoned; three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I have spent in the depth [of the sea].</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.26'>In journeys often, in dangers of rivers, in dangers of robbers, in dangers from my own race, in dangers from the Gentiles, in dangers in the city, in dangers in the wilderness, in dangers in the sea, in dangers among false brothers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.27'>in labor and hardship, in sleepless nights often, in hunger and thirst, in fastings often, in cold and nakedness-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.28'>apart from what I leave unmentioned, what comes against me daily: the anxiety for all the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.29'>Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is caused to stumble, and I do not burn [with indignation]?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.30'>If I must boast, I will boast about the things concerning my weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.31'>The God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.32'>In Damascus the governor, under Aretas the king, was guarding the city of the Damascenes with a garrison, desiring to arrest me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.11.33'>but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped from his hands.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.12'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.1'>It is indeed not profitable for me to boast. I will come to visions and revelations of the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.2'>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago-whether in the body I do not know, or whether out of the body I do not know, God knows-such a one was caught up to the third heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.3'>And I know such a man-whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.4'>that he was caught up into Paradise and heard unspeakable words, which it is not permitted for a man to utter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.5'>Concerning such a one I will boast, but concerning myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.6'>For if I should desire to boast, I will not be foolish; for I will speak [the] truth. But I spare [you], lest anyone consider me to be beyond what he sees me [to be] or hears something from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.7'>And lest I exalt myself above measure by the excellence of the revelations, a thorn in the flesh was given to me, an angel of Satan, that it might beat me, lest I exalt myself above measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.8'>Concerning this I pleaded with the Lord three times that it might depart from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.9'>And He said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness."Therefore most gladly I will rather boast in my weaknesses, in order that the power of Christ may rest upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.10'>Therefore I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in calamities, in persecutions, in distresses, for Christ's sake. For whenever I am weak, then I am strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.11'>I have become a fool in boasting; you have compelled me! For I ought to have been commended by you; for in nothing have I been inferior to the super apostles, though I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.12'>Truly the signs of an apostle were worked among you with all perseverance, in signs and wonders and miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.13'>For what is it in which you were inferior to other churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.14'>Now for the third time I am ready to come to you, and I will not burden you. For I do not seek what is yours, but you. For the children ought not to store up for the parents, but the parents for the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.15'>And I gladly will spend and be expended for your souls; although the more abundantly I love you, the less I am loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.16'>But be that as it may, I did not burden you. Nevertheless, being crafty, I took you with guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.17'>Did I take advantage of you by any of those whom I sent to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.18'>I urged Titus, and I sent with him the brother. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did [we] not [walk] in the same Spirit? Did we not walk in the same steps?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.19'>Again, do you think that we are defending ourselves to you? We speak before God in Christ. But we do all things, beloved, for your edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.20'>For I am afraid, lest perhaps when I come, I will not find you as I desire, and that I will be found by you as you do not desire; lest perhaps there[ be] contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, disputes, slanders, gossipings, pride, disorders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.12.21'>lest, when I come again, my God will humble me before you, and I will mourn for many who have previously sinned and have not repented for the impurity and fornication and lewdness which they practiced.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.1'>This [will be] the third time I am coming to you. "By the mouth of two or three witnesses every word shall be established."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.2'>I have previously said, and I say beforehand, as being present the second [time], and now being absent I write to those who have sinned before, and to all the rest, that if I come again I will not spare [you,]</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.3'>since you are seeking proof of Christ speaking in me, who is not weak toward you, but strong in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.4'>For although He was crucified in weakness, yet He lives by the power of God. For we are weak in Him, yet we shall live with Him by the power of God toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.5'>Scrutinize yourselves as to whether you are in the faith; prove your own selves. Or do you not know yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you are reprobates?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.6'>But I trust that you will know that we are not reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.7'>Now I pray to God that you do no evil, not that we may appear approved, but that you may do what is honorable, though we may be as reprobates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.8'>For we can do nothing against the truth, but on behalf of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.9'>For we rejoice whenever we are weak, but you are strong. And this also we pray, that you may be made complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.10'>Because of this I write these things being absent, in order that when I am present I may not deal sharply with you, according to the authority which the Lord gave me for edification and not for destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.11'>Finally brothers, farewell. Restore [yourselves,] comfort [yourselves], be in agreement, be at peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.12'>Greet one another with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.13'>All the saints greet you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.13.14'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Amen.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostle (not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father who raised Him from the dead),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brothers with me, to the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave Himself for our sins, so that He might deliver us from this present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom [be] glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that you are turning so quickly from Him who called you in the grace of Christ, to a different gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>which is not another; except there are certain people who trouble you and wish to pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But even if we, or an angel from heaven, should preach a gospel to you other than what we preached to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, and I say again just now, if anyone preaches a gospel to you other than what you received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For do I now persuade men, or God? Or do I seek to please men? For if I still pleased men, I would not be a bondservant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I make known to you, brothers, the gospel preached by me is not according to man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For I neither received it from man, nor was I taught it, but through the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For you have heard of my former conduct at one time in Judaism, that beyond measure I used to persecute the church of God, and I was devastating it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And I was advancing in Judaism above many my own age, being far more zealous for the traditions of my forefathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it pleased God, who separated me from my mother's womb and called me through His grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal His Son in me, so that I might preach Him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with flesh and blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>neither did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me; but I went to Arabia, and returned once more to Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Peter, and I stayed with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But I saw none of the other apostles except James, the Lord's brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now what I write to you, behold, before God, I do not lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And I was unknown by face to the churches of Judea which are in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>But they heard only, "He who persecuted us in times past now preaches the faith which at one time he was devastating."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, also taking Titus along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went up by revelation, and I set before them that gospel which I preach among the Gentiles, but privately to those with influence, lest somehow I might run, or had run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But not even Titus who was with me, although he was a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>and that was because of false brothers secretly brought in (who slipped in to spy out our freedom which we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might reduce us to slavery),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>to whom not even for an hour did we yield in subjection, that the truth of the gospel might remain with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But from those who seemed to be something-whatever they were, it makes no difference to me; God shows partiality to no man-so to me, those with influence contributed nothing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but on the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted [with] the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter [was with the gospel ]for the circumcised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for He who worked with Peter in [the] apostleship to the circumcised, worked also with me in [that for] the Gentiles),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and when James, Cephas, and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace which was given to me, they gave me and Barnabas the right hand of fellowship, that we [should go] to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>only they desired that we should remember the poor, which indeed I made every effort to do this very thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Peter came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was to be blamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before certain [men] came from James, he would eat together with the Gentiles; but when they came, he began to draw back and began to separate himself, fearing those of the circumcision party.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy, so that even Barnabas was carried away with their hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they did not act rightly with respect to the truth of the gospel, I said to Peter before them all, "If you, being a Jew, live in Gentile fashion and not in Jewish fashion, why do you compel the Gentiles to live as Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We [who are] Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but by [the ]faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be justified by [the] faith of Christ, and not by [the] works of the law; because no flesh shall be justified by [the] works of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if by seeking to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, then is Christ a minister of sin? By no means!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build again the[ ]things which I destroyed, I make myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I through the law died to the law, that I might live to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I have been crucified with Christ; it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me; and the [life] which I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave Himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not annul the grace of God; for if righteousness comes through the law, then Christ died for nothing."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you, that you should not obey the truth, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was portrayed publicly among you as crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only do I wish to learn from you: Did you receive the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish? Having begun in the Spirit, will you now be made perfect in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Have you suffered so many things in vain-If indeed [they] really [were] in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>Therefore He who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you, does He do it by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Just as Abraham "believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know therefore that those who are of faith, these are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, [saying] that, "In you all the nations shall be blessed."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>Therefore those who are of faith are blessed with believing Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse; for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who does not continue in all the things which are written in the book of the law, to do them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that no one is justified by the law before God is evident, for "The just shall live by faith."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>But the law is not of faith, but "the man who does them shall live by them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us, for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>so that the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brothers, I speak in human fashion: A covenant is of a man, yet having been confirmed, no one annuls or adds to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham and his Seed were the promises spoken. He does not say, "And to seeds,"as of many, but as of one, "And to your Seed,"who is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>And this I say, that the law, which was four hundred and thirty years later, does not annul the covenant previously confirmed to Christ by God, so that it make the promise of no effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance [comes] by the law, it is no longer of promise; but God has given it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Why then the law? It was added on account of transgressions, until the Seed should come to whom it had been promised; and it was commanded through angels by the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now the mediator is not for one person, but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Therefore, [is] the law against the promises of God? By no means! For if a law had been given which was able to give life, truly righteousness would have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the Scripture has confined all under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept in custody under the law, having been hemmed in for the faith which was to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>Therefore the law has become our custodian, [leading us] to Christ, so that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But after faith has come, we are no longer under a custodian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all sons of God through faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There is neither Jew nor Greek, neither slave nor free, there is neither male nor female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's seed, and heirs according to the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>Now I say, for as much time as the heir is a minor, he does not differ at all from a slave, though he is master of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under guardians and stewards until the time appointed by the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>Even so we, when we were minors, were enslaved by the elements of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fullness of the time had come, God sent forth His Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>so that He might redeem those under the law, so that we might receive the adoption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into your hearts, crying out, "Abba, Father!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>Therefore you are no longer a slave but a son, and if a son, also an heir of God through Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>But at one time indeed, when you did not know God, you were slaves to those which by nature were not gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>But now, having known God, or rather, having been known by God, how is it that you turn again to the weak and beggarly elements, to which once again you wish to be slaves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>You observe days and months and seasons and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid for you, lest somehow I have worked hard for you in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Brothers, I beseech you, become as I am, because I also [am] as you [are]. You have not wronged me at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>You know that because of weakness in the flesh I preached the gospel to you the former [time.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And my trial which was in my flesh you did not despise nor disdain, but as an angel of God you received me, even as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>What then was your blessing? For I bear you witness that, if possible, you would have torn out your own eyes and given them to me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Have I therefore become your enemy by speaking the truth to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They are zealous about you in the wrong way; but they wish to shut you out, so that you will be zealous about them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is good to be zealous in a good thing always, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, for whom I labor in birth again until Christ is formed in you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>And I wanted to be present with you just now and to change my tone; because I am uncertain about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you who wish to be under the law, do you not hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written that Abraham had two sons: the one by the servant girl, the other by a freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he who was of the servant girl was born according to the flesh, and he of the freewoman through the promise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>which things are symbolic. For these are two covenants: one in fact from Mount Sinai, bearing children into slavery, which is Hagar-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>for Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia, and corresponds to the present Jerusalem, and is in slavery with her children-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>but the Jerusalem above is free, which is the mother of us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written: "Rejoice, O barren, who does not give birth; break forth and shout, who does not have birth pangs; because the children of the desolate are many more than those of her who has a husband."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>But we, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But just as then the [one] who was born according to the flesh persecuted the [one born] according to the Spirit, so also it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the servant girl and her son, for the son of the servant girl shall by no means inherit with the son of the freewoman."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>So then, brothers, we are not children of the servant girl, but of the free[woman].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Stand fast therefore in the freedom in which Christ has made us free, and do not be loaded down again with a yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Indeed I, Paul, say to you that if you become circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>And I testify again to every man who becomes circumcised that he is a obligated to keep the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>You have become estranged from Christ, you who are justified by law; you have fallen from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we by the Spirit eagerly await [for] the hope of righteousness by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>You were running well; who hindered you from obeying the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion does not come from Him who calls you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leavens the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence in you, in the Lord, that you will be intent on nothing else; but he who troubles you will bear his judgment, whoever he may be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>And I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been done away with.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>Oh that those who disturb you would even castrate themselves!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For you, brothers were called to freedom; only do not use freedom for an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the law is fulfilled in one word, in [this]: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>I say then: Walk in the Spirit, and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; and these things oppose each other, so that you do not do the things that you wish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are: adultery, fornication, immorality, lewdness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, outbursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissensions, factions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envies, murders, drinking bouts, revelries, and the like; which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>gentleness, self-control-against such things there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brothers, if a man is overtaken in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a person in a spirit of gentleness, looking out for yourself lest you also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear one another's burdens, and thus fulfill the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if anyone thinks that he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let each [person] examine his own work, and then he will have boasting in himself alone, and not in the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For each one shall bear his own load.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>Let him who is taught the word share in all good things with him who teaches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Do not be deceived, God is not mocked; for what a man sows, this also he will reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he who sows to his flesh, from his own flesh will reap corruption, but he who sows to the Spirit, from the Spirit will reap everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And while we do good, let us not lose heart, for in due season we shall reap if we do not become weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>So then, as we have opportunity, let us work what is good toward all, but especially toward those who are of the household of faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See with what large letters I have written to you with my own hand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as wish to make a good showing in the flesh, these compel you to get circumcised, only so that they should not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For not even those who are circumcised keep the law themselves, but they wish you to be circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But God forbid that I should boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision means anything, but a new creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>Finally, let no one cause me trouble, for I bear in my body the marks of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>Brothers, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>being diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This I say, therefore, and testify in the Lord, that you should no longer walk as the rest of the Gentiles walk, in the vanity of their mind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>having been darkened in understanding, being estranged from the life of God, because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>for the fruit of the Spirit is in all goodness, righteousness, and truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>proving what is well-pleasing to the Lord.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For it is shameful even to speak of those things being done by them in secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>But all things that are exposed are made manifest by the light, for whatever makes manifest is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Therefore He says: "Awake, you who are sleeping, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See then that you walk carefully, not as unwise, but as wise,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>redeeming the time, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord [is].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And do not get drunk with wine, in which is dissipation; but be filled with the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>subjecting yourselves to one another in the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>Wives, subject yourselves to your own husbands, as to the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>because the husband is head of the wife, as also Christ is head of the church; and He is the Savior of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But just as the church is subject to Christ, so also the wives be to their own husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your own wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>in order that He might sanctify her, cleansing her by the washing of water by the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>that He might present her to Himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies; he that loves his own wife loves himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as also the Lord does the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are members of His body, of His flesh and of His bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This is a great mystery, but I speak in reference to Christ and to the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless you also individually, let each one love his own wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respect her husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.2.26'>since he was longing for you all, and was distressed because you had heard that he was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.27'>For indeed he was sick, [and ]near death; but God showed mercy [on] him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.2.28'>Therefore I sent him more eagerly, in order that when you see him again you may have joy, and I may be less anxious.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.2'>Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the [false] circumcision!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.3'>For we are the [true] circumcision, worshipping by the Spirit of God, rejoicing in Christ Jesus, and having no confidence in the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.4'>although I also [am] having confidence in the flesh. If any other [person] thinks to have confidence in the flesh, I even more:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.6'>with respect to zeal, persecuting the church; with respect to righteousness which is in the law, blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.7'>But such things as were gain to me, these I have considered loss for the sake of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.8'>More than that I also consider all things to be loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have sustained the loss of all things, and I consider them to be rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.9'>and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness, which is of the law, but that which is through [the] faith of Christ, the righteousness [which is] of God by faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.10'>[so as] to know Him and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.11'>if in some way I may attain to the resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.12'>Not that I have already obtained, or have already been made perfect; but I press on, if also I may lay hold of that for which I was laid hold of by Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.13'>Brothers, I do not count myself to have laid hold; but one thing[ I do], forgetting those things which are behind, and reaching forward to those things which are ahead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.14'>I press toward the goal for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.15'>Therefore, as many as are mature, let us think this way; and if in anything you think otherwise, even this God will reveal to you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.3.18'>For many walk, of whom often I was speaking to you, and now even weeping I tell you, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.19'>whose end is destruction, whose god is their belly, and whose glory is in their shame-who are mindful of earthly things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.20'>For our citizenship exists in heaven, from which also we eagerly await for the Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.3.21'>who will transform our lowly body, that it may be conformed to His glorious body, according to the working by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.4.11'>Not that I am speaking with respect to need, for I have learned to be content in whatever state I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.12'>I know how to be abased, and I know how to abound. In every place and in all [circumstances] I have learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in need.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Phil.4.15'>Now you Philippians also know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, no church shared with me in an accounting of giving and receiving except you only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.16'>Because even in Thessalonica, both once and again you sent for my need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.17'>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which is increasing to your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.18'>And I have all things and abound. I have been made full, having received from Epaphroditus the things [sent] from you, a fragrant aroma, an acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Phil.4.19'>And my God will supply all your need according to His riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Thess.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.1'>For you yourselves know, brothers, [regarding] our coming to you, that it was not in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.2'>But suffering before and being spitefully treated at Philippi, just as you know, we were bold in our God to speak to you the gospel of God with much conflict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.3'>For our exhortation [was ]not from error nor from uncleanness, nor in trickery,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.4'>but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, even so we speak, not as pleasing men, but God who is testing our hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.5'>For neither were we using flattering speech, as you know, nor covering up greed, God is [our ]witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.6'>Nor seeking glory from men, neither from you, nor from others, even though we were able to carry weight as apostles of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.7'>But we proved to be gentle in your midst, as a nursing [mother] cherishes her own children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.8'>In this way longing for you, we were well pleased to impart to you not only the gospel of God, but also our own lives, because you had become dear to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.9'>For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil; for laboring night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.10'>You are witnesses, and [so is ]God, how devoutly and justly and blamelessly we were among you that believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.11'>as indeed you know how each one of you, as a father [to] his own children, we exhorted, and comforted [you], and imploring you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.12'>that you would walk worthy of God who calls you into His own kingdom and glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.13'>Because of this we also give thanks to God unceasingly, so that when you received the word of God which you heard from us, you received not the word of men, but just as it truly is, the word of God, which also is at work in you that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.14'>For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God which are in Judea in Christ Jesus, because you suffered the same things from your fellow countrymen, just as also they [did] by the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.15'>who killed both the Lord Jesus and their own prophets, and have persecuted us; and they do not please God and [are] against all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.16'>forbidding us from speaking to the Gentiles so that they may be saved, so as always to fill up [the measure of] their sins; but the wrath [of God ]has come upon them to the uttermost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.17'>But we, brothers, being unwillingly separated from you for a short season, in presence, not in heart, were all the more eager to see your face with much desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.18'>Therefore we desired to come to you-I, Paul, time and again, but Satan hindered us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.19'>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of boasting? [Is] it not even you, in the presence of our Lord Jesus at His coming?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.2.20'>For you are our glory and joy.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.1'>Therefore, when we could no longer endure it, we were well pleased to be left behind in Athens alone,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.2'>and sent Timothy, our brother and minister of God, and our fellow worker in the gospel of Christ, in order to establish you and encourage you concerning your faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.3'>that no one should be disturbed by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed unto this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.4'>For even when we were with you, we were telling you in advance that we were going to be afflicted, just as it also happened, and you know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.5'>Because of this, when I could no longer endure [it], I sent to learn about your faith, lest somehow the tempter had tempted you, and our labor be in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.6'>But now when Timothy came to us from you, and brought good news to us of your faith and your love, and that you have good remembrance of us always, longing to see us, as we also [long to see] you-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.7'>because of this we were encouraged, brothers, in regard to you in all our affliction and distress by your faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.8'>Because now we live, if you stand firm in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.9'>For whatever thanksgiving can we render to God for you, for all the joy with which we are rejoicing because of you in the presence of our God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.10'>night and day praying exceedingly that we may see your face and to perfect what is lacking in your faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.11'>Now may our God and Father Himself, and our Lord Jesus Christ, lead us directly to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.12'>And may the Lord make you to increase and abound in love toward one another and toward all [men], as indeed we also do toward you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.3.13'>so that He may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all His saints.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.1'>Finally then, brothers, we request of you and exhort [you] in the Lord Jesus, just as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, that you should abound more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.2'>For you know what commandments we gave you through the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.3'>For this is [the] will of God, your sanctification: that you should abstain from fornication,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.4'>that each of you should know how to possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.5'>not in lustful passion, like the Gentiles who do not know God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.6'>that no one should transgress against and to defraud his brother in this matter, because the Lord is the avenger concerning all, just as we told you before and solemnly testified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.7'>For God did not call us to uncleanness, but in sanctification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.8'>Therefore he who rejects [this] does not reject man, but God, who has given His Holy Spirit to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.9'>Now concerning brotherly love you have no need [for me] to write to you, for you yourselves are taught by God to love one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.10'>For indeed you do so toward all the brothers in all Macedonia. But we exhort you, brothers, that you increase more and more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.11'>and that you aspire to be quiet, and to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, just as we commanded you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.12'>in order that you may walk decently toward those that are outside, and may have need of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.13'>Now we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, concerning those who have fallen asleep, lest you be sorrowful as those who have no hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.14'>For if we believe that Jesus died and rose [again], thus also God will bring with Him those who sleep in Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.15'>For this we say to you by the word of the Lord, that we who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord shall by no means precede those who are asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.16'>Because the Lord Himself shall descend from heaven with a word of command, with [the] voice of an archangel, and with [the] trumpet of God, and the dead in Christ shall rise first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.17'>Then we who are alive [and] remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. And thus we shall always be with the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.4.18'>So then comfort one another with these words.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Thess.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.1'>But concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need that I should write to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.2'>For you yourselves know accurately that the day of the Lord so comes as a thief in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.3'>For when they say, "Peace and safety!"then sudden destruction comes upon them, just as labor pains upon the woman that is pregnant, and they shall by no means escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.4'>But you, brothers, are not in darkness, so that this Day should overtake you as a thief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.5'>You are all sons of light and sons of the day. We are not of the night nor of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.6'>Therefore let us not sleep, as others do, but let us watch and be sober.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.7'>For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those[ ]getting drunk, are drunk at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.8'>But we, since we are of the day, let us be sober, putting on a breastplate of faith and love, and as a helmet, the hope of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.9'>For God did not appoint us to wrath, but to [the] obtaining of salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.10'>who died for us, in order that whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.11'>Therefore comfort each other and edify one another, just as you also are doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.12'>And we request of you, brothers, to recognize those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and instruct you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.13'>and to regard them beyond all measure in love, because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.14'>Now we exhort you, brothers, admonish the disorderly, encourage the discouraged, be supportive of the weak, be patient toward all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.15'>See that no one pays back evil for evil to anyone, but always pursue that which is good, both for one another and for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.16'>Rejoice always!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.17'>Pray without ceasing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.18'>In everything give thanks; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.19'>Do not quench the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.20'>Do not despise prophecies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.21'>But test all things; hold fast that which is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.22'>Abstain from every form of evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.23'>Now [may] the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely; and may your whole spirit, soul, and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.24'>He who calls you is faithful, who also will do [this].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.25'>Brothers, pray for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.26'>Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Thess.5.27'>I adjure you by the Lord [for] this letter to be read to all the holy brothers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>in hope of eternal life which God, who cannot lie, promised before time [itself],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>but has in due time manifested His word in a proclamation, [with ]which I was entrusted according to the command of God our Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus, [my ]own son according to [our] common faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God [the] Father and [the] Lord Jesus Christ our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>For this reason I left you behind in Crete, so that you should set in order the things[ ]that are lacking, and you should appoint elders in every city as I commanded you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>if a man is unimpeachable, the husband of one wife, having faithful children not accused of dissipation or [who are ]insubordinate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>For a bishop must be unimpeachable, as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered, not given to wine, not violent, not greedy for money,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>but hospitable, loving good, prudent, just, holy, temperate,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>holding fast to the faithful word as he was taught, that he may be able to exhort by sound doctrine, and to convince those who oppose it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are also many insubordinate, both idle talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>whom it is necessary to shut [their] mouths, who overturn whole households, teaching things which they ought not, for the sake of dishonest gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>There said a certain one of them, a prophet of their own, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, idle gluttons."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>This testimony is true; for which cause rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>not giving heed to Jewish myths and to commands of men turning away from the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>All things indeed are pure to the pure; but to those who are defiled and unbelieving nothing is pure; but even their mind and conscience have been defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They profess to know God, but in their works they deny Him, being abominable, disobedient, and disqualified for every good work.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But you speak the[ ]things which suit sound doctrine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>temperate, pure, homemakers, good, submitting to their own husbands, lest the word of God be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Likewise exhort the young men to be sensible,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>sound speech that cannot be condemned, in order that the [one] who is an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we should live soberly, righteously, and godly in the present age,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>to slander no one, to be peaceable, gentle, demonstrating all meekness to all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>For we ourselves were also once foolish, disobedient, being deceived, being enslaved to various lusts and pleasures, living in malice and envy, hateful, and hating one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>But when the kindness and the love of God our Savior toward man appeared,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>not by works of righteousness which we did, but according to His mercy He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>Reject a divisive man after the first and second admonition,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has in these last days spoken to us by [His] Son, whom He has appointed heir [of] all things, through whom also He made the worlds;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who being the radiance of His glory and the exact expression of His substance, and upholding all things by the word of His power, when He had by Himself purged our sins, sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>having become so much better than the angels, as He has inherited a more excellent name than they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did He ever say: "You are My Son, today I have begotten You"? And again: "I will be a Father to Him, and He shall be a Son to Me"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>But when He again brings the firstborn into the world, He says: "Let all the angels of God worship Him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And of the angels He says, "He who makes His angels spirits and His ministers flames of fire."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But of the Son [He says]: "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever; the scepter of righteousness is the scepter of Your Kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your companions."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And: "You, LORD, in the beginning laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish, but You continue; and they all shall grow old like a garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and like a cloak You will roll them up, and they shall be changed. But You are the same, and Your years shall not fail."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels has He ever said: "Sit at My right hand, till I make Your enemies a footstool for Your feet"?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Are they not all ministering spirits being sent out to minister for the sake of those who shall be heirs of salvation?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>On account of this we must give the more earnest heed to the things we have heard, lest we drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the word which was spoken through angels was confirmed, and every transgression and disobedience received a just retribution,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how shall we escape if we neglect so great a salvation, which in the beginning was spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed to us by those who heard,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>God also bearing witness both with signs and wonders, with various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For He did not subject the world which is to come, concerning which we speak, to angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>But someone somewhere testified, saying: "What is man that You are mindful of him, or the son of man that You visit him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You made him a little lower than the angels, You crowned him with glory and honor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>You have subjected all things under his feet."For in subjecting to him all things[, ]He left nothing not subjected to him. But now we do not yet see all things having been subjected to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels, through the suffering of death, having been crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God, He might taste death for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>For it was fitting for Him, on account of whom [are] all things and through whom [are] all things, in bringing many sons to glory, to perfect the Author of their salvation through sufferings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of one; for which reason He is not ashamed to call them brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying: "I will declare Your name to My brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing praise to You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again: "I will put My trust in Him."And again: "Behold I and the children to whom God has given Me."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Therefore since the children have partaken of flesh and blood, He Himself likewise shared in the same things, in order that through death He might destroy the [one] having the power of death, that is, the devil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and that He might set free these, as many as by fear of death through all of their lives, were subject to bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For indeed He does not take hold of angels, but He does take hold of the seed of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Therefore He was obligated to become like His brothers in all [respects], in order that He might become a merciful and faithful High Priest in things [pertaining] to God, in order that He might make propitiation for the sins of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>For in that which He Himself has suffered, being tempted, He is able to help those who are tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brothers, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and High Priest of our confession, Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>who is faithful to Him who appointed Him, as Moses also was faithful in all His house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For He has been counted worthy of more honor than Moses, inasmuch as He who built the house has more honor than the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>For every house is built by someone, but He[ ]who built all things is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses indeed was faithful in all His house as a servant, for a testimony of the things which would be spoken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ [was faithful ]as a Son over His own house, whose house we are if we hold fast the confidence and the boast of hope firm until [the] end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, just as the Holy Spirit says: "Today, if you will hear His voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>Do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the day of trial in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>Where your fathers tested Me, they tried Me, and saw My works forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>Therefore I was indignant with that generation, and said, 'They go astray in their heart; and they did not know My ways.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So I swore in My wrath, 'They shall not enter My rest.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take heed, brothers, lest there be in any one of you a wicked heart of unbelief in departing from the living God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>but encourage yourselves every day, while it is called "Today,"lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we have become partakers of Christ, if indeed we hold fast the beginning of the assurance firm until the end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>while it is said: "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>For some, having heard, did provoke: but not all who came out of Egypt through Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was He indignant forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did He swear that they would not enter into His rest, except to those who disobeyed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And we see that they were not able to enter on account of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore let us fear, lest while the promise remains to enter into His rest, any one of you seems to have fallen short.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For indeed we have had the gospel preached [to us] just as those also; but the word which they heard did not profit those, not having been mixed with faith in those having heard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have believed enter that rest, as He has said: "So I swore in My wrath, they shall not enter My rest,"although His works were finished from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For He has said somewhere concerning the seventh day thus, "And God rested on the seventh day from all His works;"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and again in this place: "They shall not enter My rest."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Therefore since it remains [for] some to enter into it, and those formerly having the gospel preached [to them] did not enter on account of disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again He appoints a certain day, saying in David, "Today,"after such a time, just as it has been said: "Today, if you will hear His voice, do not harden your hearts."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them rest, then He would not have spoken afterward of another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>Then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For he who has entered into His rest also rested himself from his works, as God [did] from His own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Therefore let us be diligent to enter into that rest, lest anyone falls in the same example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the division of soul and spirit, and of joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>And there is no creature hidden before Him, but all things are naked and open to His eyes, to whom we must give an account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Therefore having a great High Priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast the confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we do not have a High Priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses, but having been tempted in all [respects] in quite the same way as [we are], yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest taken from among men is appointed for men in the things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>being able to deal gently with those who sin in ignorance and go astray, since he himself is also subject to weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>On account of this he is obligated to offer [sacrifices ]for sins, just as concerning the people, so also concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And no man takes this honor for himself, but he that is called by God, just as Aaron also [was].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>So also Christ did not glorify Himself to become High Priest, but it was He who said to Him: "You are My Son, Today I have begotten You."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>Just as He also says in another place: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek";</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>who, in the days of His flesh, when He had offered up both prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears to the [One] who was able to save Him from death, and was heard because of His fear of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>though He was a Son, He learned obedience by the things which He suffered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>And having been perfected, He became the author of eternal salvation to all who obey Him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>having been designated by God a High Priest "according to the order of Melchizedek,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>concerning whom we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become sluggish in hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>For indeed, although you ought to be teachers by this time, again you have need [for someone ]to teach you what are the elements of the beginning of the oracles of God; and you have come to need milk and not solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For everyone who partakes [only ]of milk is unacquainted with the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food is for the mature, for those because of their practice have their senses trained for the distinguishing of both good and evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, leaving the subject of the beginning of Christ, let us be moved to perfection, not again laying down a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>of the doctrine of baptisms, of laying on of hands, and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And let us do this if indeed God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and became partakers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>and have tasted the good word of God and [the] powerful deeds of the age to come,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and having fallen away, to renew [them] again to repentance, since they crucify again for themselves the Son of God, and hold Him up to contempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For the earth which drinks the rain often coming upon it, and bears suitable vegetation for those on account of whom it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>but if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, of which the end [is] for burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>But we are persuaded concerning you, beloved, of better things and those pertaining to salvation, even though we speak in this manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not unjust to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward His name, in that you have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we desire that each one of you show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until [the] end,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>lest you become dull, but [become] imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since He could swear by no one greater, He swore by Himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>saying, "Surely blessing I will bless you, and multiplying I will multiply you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so, after he had been patient, he obtained the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For men indeed swear by the greater, and the oath for confirmation [is] an end of every dispute to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>Thus God, wanting to show even more clearly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness of His counsel, guaranteed it by an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>in order that through two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we might have strong encouragement, who have fled to take hold of the hope being set before [us];</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>which [hope] we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and secure, and which enters into the inner [side] of the veil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where the Forerunner has entered on our behalf, [even] Jesus, having become a High Priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>to whom also Abraham divided a tenth from all, first being interpreted "king of righteousness,"and then also king of Salem, which is "king of peace,"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>without father, without mother, without genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but having been made like the Son of God, remains a priest continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>But observe how great this [man was], to whom even the patriarch Abraham gave a tenth of the spoils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>And indeed those who are of the sons of Levi, who receive the priesthood, have a commandment to collect tithes from the people according to the law, that is, from their brothers, though they have come from the loins of Abraham;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>but the [one] not tracing his descent from them has received tithes from Abraham, and he has blessed the [one] having the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>Now without any contradiction the lesser is blessed by the better.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>And here on the one hand mortal men receive tithes, but there on the other he[ receives them], of whom[ ]it is witnessed that he lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>Even Levi, the [one] receiving tithes, has paid tithes through Abraham, so to speak,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Therefore, if perfection was through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people have received the law), why is there yet a need [for] another priest to rise, according to the order of Melchizedek, and not to be called according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For the priesthood being changed, of necessity there occurs a change of law also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For He concerning whom these things are spoken belongs to another tribe, from which no one has officiated at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is evident that our Lord has risen out of Judah, regarding which tribe Moses spoke nothing concerning priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>And it is yet even more clearer, if according to the likeness of Melchizedek, there arises another priest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who has come, not according to the law of a fleshly commandment, but according to the power of an endless life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For He testifies: "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>For on the one hand an annulment comes about of the preceding commandment on account of its weakness and uselessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>For the law made nothing perfect; but there[ is] the bringing in of a better hope, through which we draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>And inasmuch as [it was] not without an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>for they have become priests without an oath, but He with an oath by Him that said to Him: "The LORD has sworn and will not relent, 'You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek' ",</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>by so much more Jesus has become the guarantee of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>Also there were many priests, because they were prevented by death from continuing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But He, because He remains forever, has an unchangeable priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Therefore He is also able to save to the uttermost those coming to God through Him, since He always lives to make intercession for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>For such a High Priest was fitting for us, who is holy, innocent, undefiled, having been separated from sinners, and has become higher than the heavens;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>who does not need daily, as those high priests, to offer up sacrifices beforehand, on behalf of His own sins and then for the people's, for this He did once for all when He offered up Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law appoints men as high priests who have weakness, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, [appoints] a Son who has been perfected forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now this is the main point of the things being said: We have such a High Priest, who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord set up, and not man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices; therefore it is necessary that this [high priest] also have something to offer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>For if He were on earth, He would not be a priest, since there are priests who offer the gifts according to the law;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>who serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things, just as Moses had been warned when he was about to complete the tabernacle, for He says, "See, you shall make all things according to the pattern shown to you on the mountain."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>But now He has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as He is also Mediator of a better covenant, which has been enacted upon better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if that first [covenant] had been faultless, then no place would have been sought for a second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>For finding fault [with] them, He says: "Behold, the days are coming, says the LORD, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>not according to the covenant which I made with their fathers, in the day when I took their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. Because they did not persevere in My covenant, and I disregarded them, says the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws in their mind, and I will inscribe them upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they shall be My people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>And by no means will they teach each [one ]his fellow citizen, and each [one] his brother, saying, 'Know the LORD,' for all shall know Me, from the least of them to the greatest of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful to their iniquities, and their sins and their lawless deeds I shall by no means remember anymore."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In that He says, "A new [covenant],"He has made the first obsolete. And whatever is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now even the first [covenant] had ordinances of [divine] service and the earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tabernacle was prepared: the first [part], in which [were] both the lampstand and the table and the showbread, which is called the holy place;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>and after the second veil, the part of the tabernacle which is called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>having a golden altar, and the ark of the covenant having been overlaid on all sides with gold, in which [was] a golden jar holding the manna, and the rod of Aaron which budded, and the tablets of the covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>and above it [were] cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat; concerning these things we cannot now speak in detail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>Now when these things had been thus prepared, the priests always went into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the services,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>but into the second [part] the high priest [goes] alone once during the year, not without blood, which he offers for himself and for the people's sins committed in ignorance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>the Holy Spirit signifying this, that the way into the Holiest of All was not yet revealed while the first tabernacle was still standing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>which [was] symbolic for the present time, according to which both gifts and sacrifices are being offered, which are not able, in respect to conscience, to make perfect the [one] performing the service,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>[concerned] only with foods and drinks, various washings, and fleshly ordinances which are imposed until a time of reformation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But Christ came [as] a High Priest of the good things to come, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not made with hands, that is, not of this creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood, He entered once for all into the Holies, having obtained eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of bulls and goats and the ashes of a heifer, sprinkling those having been defiled, sanctifies for the purity of the flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>by how much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without spot to God, will cleanse your conscience from dead works in order that we might serve the living God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>And on account of this He is the Mediator of the new covenant, so that, since a death has occurred for redemption of the transgressions at the time of the first covenant, that those having been called may receive the promise of the eternal inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there [is] a testament, there is necessity for death to be offered of the [one] making the testament.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a testament is valid over dead [people], since it is never valid when the [one] making the testament lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>Therefore not even the first [covenant] has been dedicated without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For when every commandment had been spoken by Moses according to law to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water, scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, "This is the blood of the covenant which God has commanded you."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>And likewise he sprinkled both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service with the blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>And according to the law almost all things are purified with blood, and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>Therefore it [was] necessary that the copies of the things in the heavens to be continually purified with these, but the heavenly things themselves by better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ did not enter into [the] holies made by hands, which are copies of the true, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>not that He should offer Himself often, as the high priest enters into the Holies every year with another's blood-</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>since it would have been necessary [for] Him to suffer often from the foundation of the world; but now, once at the consummation of the ages, He has appeared to put away sin through the sacrifice of Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>And inasmuch as it is appointed for men once to die and after this judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so also Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time apart from sin unto salvation, to those who eagerly await Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the image itself of the things, can never with the same sacrifices, which they offer continually every year, make those approaching perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>Otherwise they would not have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>But in them there is a reminder of sins every year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>For it is not possible for [the] blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>Therefore, when He entered into the world, He said: "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, but a body You have prepared for Me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In burnt offerings and [sacrifices] for sin You had no pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, 'Behold, I have come-In the volume of the book it is written of Me- To do Your will, O God.' "</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>Earlier saying, "Sacrifice and offering, burnt offerings, and [sacrifices] for sin You did not desire, nor had pleasure in them"(which are offered according to the law),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>then He has said, "Behold, I have come to do Your will, O God."He takes away the first in order that He may establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which are never able to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But He Himself, having offered one sacrifice for sins forever, He sat down at the right hand of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>from that time waiting till His enemies are placed as a footstool for His feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>"This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the LORD: I will put My laws on their hearts, and I will inscribe them on their minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>and their sins and their lawless deeds I shall by no means remember any longer."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, brothers, having boldness to enter the Holiest by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>by a new and living way which He inaugurated for us, through the veil, that is, His flesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and [having] a High Priest over the house of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us approach with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our bodies having been washed with clean water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us consider one another for the stirring up of love and of good works,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not forsaking the assembling of ourselves, just as is the custom for some, but exhorting [one another], and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but a certain fearful expectation of judgment, and fiery zeal being about to devour the adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Anyone disregarding the law of Moses dies without compassions on [the testimony of] two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>By how much worse punishment, do you think, will he be deemed worthy who has trampled the Son of God underfoot, and has regarded as common the blood of the covenant, by which he was sanctified, and has insulted the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know Him who said, "Vengeance is Mine; I will repay,"says the Lord. And again, "The LORD will judge His people."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a fearful [thing] to fall into the hands of the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But remember the former days, in which after you were enlightened, you endured a great struggle of sufferings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>in part being exposed publicly, both to reproaches and to afflictions, and in part having become partners of those treated in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you sympathized with me in my chains, and you received the plunder of your possessions with joy, knowing that you have for yourselves a better and enduring possession in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>Therefore do not cast away your confidence, which has a great recompense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you have need of endurance, so that having done the will of God, you may receive the promise:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>"For yet a little while, and He who is coming will come and will not delay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>But the just shall live by faith, and if he withdraws, My soul has no pleasure in him."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>But we are not of [those] shrinking back to destruction, but of faith, to the saving of the soul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it the elders obtained witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand that time [itself] was framed by a command of God, so that the things which are seen were not made of things which are visible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God testifying concerning his gifts; and through it, although he died, he still speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was translated [so as] not to see death, "and he was not found, because God translated him"; for before his translation he had obtained witness that he was pleasing to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>But without faith it is impossible to please [God], for it is necessary [for] the [one] approaching God to believe that He is, and that He becomes a rewarder of those who diligently seek Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, having being warned [by God] concerning the things[ ]not yet seen, being reverent, prepared an ark for the salvation of his household, through which he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness which is according to faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go forth to the place which he was about to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>for he waited for the city having foundations, whose builder and maker is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith Sarah herself also received power for conception of seed, and she bore a child past the normal age, because she regarded [Him] faithful who had promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Therefore even from one [man ]they were begotten, and him as good as dead, just as the stars of the sky in multitude, and innumerable as the sand by the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>These all died according to faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them afar off and welcoming [them], and confessing that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For those saying such things make evident that they seek a fatherland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>And indeed if they had remembered that land from which they went out, they would have had opportunity to turn back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>But now they desire a better [land], that is, a heavenly [one]. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for He has prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, had offered up Isaac, and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten [son],</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.5'>And you have forgotten the exhortation which speaks to you as sons: "My son, do not despise the discipline of the LORD, nor be discouraged when you are reproved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.6'>For whom the LORD loves He disciplines, and scourges every son whom He receives."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.7'>It is for discipline [that] you endure; God deals with you as with sons. For what son is there whom a father does not discipline?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.9'>Furthermore, we have had human fathers who corrected us, and we respected [them.] Shall we not much more readily be in subjection to the Father of spirits and live?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.10'>For they indeed disciplined us for a few days, as seemed best to them, but He [disciplines us ]for [our] good, so that we may partake of His holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.11'>Now no discipline seems to be joyful for the present, but painful; nevertheless, later it yields the peaceable fruit of righteousness to those having been trained by it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.14'>Pursue peace and holiness with all [people], without which no one shall see the Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.15'>looking diligently lest anyone fall from the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness growing up cause trouble, and through this many be defiled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.16'>lest there be any fornicator or profane [person] like Esau, who in exchange for one meal gave up his birthright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.17'>For you know that indeed afterward, wishing to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, having sought it out diligently with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.18'>For you have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and to a whirlwind,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.24'>and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling which speaks better things than the [blood] of Abel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.25'>See that you do not refuse Him who speaks. For if they did not escape, having refused Him who warned [them], how much more [shall we not escape] if we turn away from Him who warns from heaven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.26'>whose voice then shook the earth; but now He has promised, saying, "Yet once more I shake not only the earth, but also the heaven."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.27'>Now the [phrase], "Yet once more,"signifies the removal of the things being shaken, as having been made, so that the things which cannot be shaken may remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.28'>Therefore, since we are receiving an unshakable kingdom, let us have grace, through which we serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jas.5.1'>Listen now, you rich, weep and howl at your miseries which are coming upon you!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.2'>Your riches have decayed, and your garments have become moth-eaten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.3'>Your gold and silver have become corroded, and their poison will be a witness against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You stored up treasure in the last days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.4'>Indeed, the wages of the laborers who reaped your fields, which were kept back by you, cry out, and the cries of the reapers have entered into the ears of the Lord of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.5'>You lived luxuriously upon the earth and you lived riotously, you nourished your hearts as in a day of slaughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.6'>You have condemned; you have murdered the just[. ]He does not resist you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.7'>Therefore be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer awaits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient for it, until it receives the early and late rain.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jas.5.10'>My brothers, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord, as an example of evil suffering and of longsuffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.11'>Indeed we count those blessed who endure. You have heard of the patience of Job, and you saw the end of the Lord-that He is compassionate and He is merciful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.12'>But above all, my brothers, do not swear, neither by heaven nor the earth, nor any other oath. But let your "Yes"be "Yes,"and [your] "No,""No,"so that you may not fall into hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jas.5.13'>Does anyone among you suffer misfortune? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praises.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.6'>In which you greatly rejoice, [though for] a little while now, if need be, you have been distressed by various trials,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.7'>so that the genuineness of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes, though being tested with fire, may be found to praise, honor, and glory at the revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.8'>Whom not having seen, you love, in whom now not seeing, but believing, you rejoice with inexpressible joy and glorified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.9'>obtaining for yourselves the outcome your faith-the salvation [of your] souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.10'>Concerning this salvation the prophets have sought out and inquired carefully, having prophesied of the grace [that would come] to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.11'>searching for who or what kind of time the Spirit of Christ in them was revealing when He testified beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories which were to follow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.12'>To them it was revealed that, not to themselves, but to you they were ministering these things, which things were now announced to you by those who proclaimed the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven-things which angels desire to look into.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.13'>Therefore gird up the loins of your mind, stay sober, put your hope fully in the grace brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.14'>as obedient children, not fashioning yourselves [after] the former lusts, [as you did in ]your ignorance;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.15'>but as He[ ]who called you is holy, you also be holy in all manner of life,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.1.16'>because it is written, "Be holy, for I am holy."</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.1'>Therefore having put away all malice, all guile, hypocrisy, envy, and all slanders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.2'>as newborn babes, desire the genuine milk of the word, that by it you may grow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.3'>if indeed you tasted that the Lord is good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.4'>Coming to Him as to a living stone, having been rejected indeed by men, but chosen by God and precious,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.5'>you also, as living stones, are being built [into] a spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.6'>For it is also contained in the Scripture, "Behold, I place in Zion a chief cornerstone, chosen, precious, and he who believes on Him shall by no means be put to shame."</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.8'>and "a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense."They stumble, being disobedient to the word, to which they also were appointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.9'>But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for God's [own] possession, that you may proclaim the excellent virtues of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.10'>who formerly [were] not a people but now [are the] people of God, who had not received mercy, but now have received mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.11'>Beloved, I implore you as sojourners and pilgrims, to abstain from the lusts of the flesh which war against the soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.12'>having your manner of life noble among the Gentiles, so that, whenever they speak against you as evildoers, when they observe the good works, they may glorify God in the day of visitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.13'>Therefore subject yourselves to every human institution on account of the Lord: whether to the king as [to one] having authority,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.14'>or to governors, as to those being sent for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise [of those] doing good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.15'>For this is the will of God, that by doing good you may silence the ignorance of foolish men-</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.16'>as free, yet not using freedom as a cover for wickedness, but as bondservants of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.17'>Honor all [people]. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.18'>Servants, subject yourselves to your masters with all fear, not only to the good and gentle, but also to the crooked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.19'>For this is admirable, if because of conscience toward God someone endures pain, suffering unjustly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.20'>For what glory [is it,] if when you sin and are beaten, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer [for it,] you endure, this is admirable before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.21'>For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered for us, leaving behind an example for you, that you should follow in His footsteps,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.22'>"Who committed no sin, nor was deceit found in His mouth";</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.23'>who, being verbally abused, did not return verbal insults, when [He] suffered, [He] did not threaten, but committed [Himself] to Him who judges righteously;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.24'>who Himself bore our sins in His body on the tree, in order that having died to sins, we might live unto righteousness-by whose stripes you were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.2.25'>For you were like sheep going astray, but you have turned back now to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.1'>Wives, likewise, subject yourselves to your own husbands, so that even if some are disobedient to the word, [that] by the conduct of their wives, without a word, they shall be gained [for Christ],</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.2'>when they observe your chaste conduct with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.3'>Of whom let it not be the outward adorning of braiding of hair, and wearing of gold, or of putting on of [fine] clothes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.4'>rather [let it be] the hidden person of the heart, with the incorruptible [attitude] of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is very precious before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.5'>For thus formerly, the holy women who hoped on God also adorned themselves, subjecting themselves to their own husbands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.6'>as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord, of whom you became children, when you do good and are not afraid of any terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.7'>Husbands, likewise, live together according to knowledge as with a weaker vessel, with the wife, showing her honor as also a fellow heir of the grace of life, in order that your prayers may not be hindered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.8'>Finally, all [of you] be like-minded, sympathetic, loving the brothers, compassionate, friendly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.9'>not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing, knowing that you were called for this purpose, that you may inherit a blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.10'>For "He that desires to love life and see good days, let him stop his tongue from evil, and his lips from speaking guile.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.11'>Let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.12'>For the eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and His ears [open] to their prayer; but the face of the LORD is against those doing evil."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.13'>And who is he that shall injure you if you become imitators of that which is good?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.14'>But even if you should suffer on account of righteousness, [you are] blessed. "But do not fear their threats, nor be troubled."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.15'>But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and always be prepared with a defense to everyone who asks you a reason for the hope that is in you, with meekness and fear;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.16'>having a good conscience, so that in what they speak against you as evildoers, those reviling your good conduct in Christ may be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.17'>For it is better to suffer for doing good, if it is the will of God, than [for] doing evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.18'>For Christ also suffered once to atone for sins, [the] just for [the] unjust, that He might bring you to God, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive by the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.19'>by whom also He went and preached to the spirits in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.20'>who formerly disobeyed, when the longsuffering of God was waiting in the days of Noah, when the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.21'>which [as] an antitype, baptism now also saves us-(not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but an appeal to God [for] a good conscience), through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.3.22'>who having gone into heaven, is at the right hand of God, angels and authorities and powers being subjected to Him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Pet.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.1'>Therefore, since Christ suffered for us in the flesh, you also arm yourselves [with] the same mind, because he who suffered in [the] flesh has ceased from sin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.2'>that he no longer should live the remaining time in the flesh for the lusts of men, but for the will of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.3'>For we have spent enough of our past lifetime to accomplish the will of the Gentiles-having walked in wantonness, lusts, drunkenness, revelries, drinking parties, and abominable idolatries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.4'>In regard to these, they are surprised that you do not run with them in the same flood of debauchery, reviling you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.5'>They will render an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.6'>Unto this [end] was the gospel proclaimed also to those who are dead, in order that they might be judged according to men in [the] flesh, but [that] they might live according to God in [the] spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.7'>Now the end of all things is at hand; therefore be of sound mind and self-controlled in your prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.8'>And above all things have fervent love for one another, because "love will cover a multitude of sins."</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.9'>Be hospitable to one another without grumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.10'>As each one has received a gift, minister it to one another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.11'>If anyone speaks, [let him speak] as the utterances of God. If anyone serves, [let him serve] as from strength, as God supplies, so that in all things God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and the power forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.12'>Beloved, do not be surprised by the fiery trial among you, taking place to test you, as though some strange thing [was] happening to you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.13'>but inasmuch as you partake in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice, in order that also at the unveiling of His glory, you may rejoice with great happiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.14'>If you are reviled in the name of Christ, blessed are you, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you. On the one hand He is blasphemed, but on the other He is glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.15'>For let not anyone of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler in other people's affairs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.16'>but if anyone [suffers] as a Christian, let him not be put to shame, but let him glorify God in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.17'>For the time [has come] for judgment to begin at the house of God; and if [it begins] with us first, what will be the end of those who are disobedient to the gospel of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.18'>And "If the righteous [one] is scarcely saved, where will the godless and the sinner appear?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Pet.4.19'>Therefore let those who suffer according to the will of God entrust their souls to Him in doing good, as to a faithful Creator.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.19'>And we have the prophetic word made more sure, which you do well to heed, as a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.1.21'>for prophecy never came by the will of man, but holy men of God spoke, being brought along by [the] Holy Spirit.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Pet.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.1'>But there were also false prophets among the people, even as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master, the [One] having bought them, and bringing upon themselves swift destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.2'>And many will follow after their debaucheries, because of whom the way of truth will be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.3'>And by covetousness they will exploit you with fabricated words; for a long time their judgment has not been idle, and their destruction will not sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.4'>For if God did not spare the angels when they sinned, but rather confined [them] to Tartarus, and delivered [them ]into chains of darkness, reserved for judgment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.5'>and did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, [the] eighth, a preacher of righteousness, when He brought a flood upon the ungodly world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.6'>and reducing the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, He condemned [them] to destruction, having made [them] an example who were to be ungodly,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.8'>(for that righteous man, living among them day after day, tormented his righteous soul by seeing and hearing their lawless deeds)-</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.9'>[then] the Lord knows [how] to deliver the godly out of temptation and [how] to keep the unjust under punishment for the day of judgment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.10'>and especially those who walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise authority. [They are ]bold, self-willed, illustrious persons, they do not tremble at blaspheming,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.11'>whereas angels, being greater in might and in power, do not bring a slanderous judgment against them before the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.12'>But these, as unreasoning natural animals, having been born for capture and destruction, blaspheme at things which they are ignorant of, and shall be destroyed in their destruction,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.13'>receiving the wages of unrighteousness, counting as a pleasure to revel in the daytime, [they are] spots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions while they feast with you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.14'>having eyes full of adultery and unable to cease from sin, enticing unstable souls, having a heart having been trained in greediness, they are accursed children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.15'>They have left behind the straight way and have gone astray, having followed after the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the wages of unrighteousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.16'>but he was rebuked for his own lawlessness: a dumb donkey speaking with the voice of a man restrained the madness of the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.17'>These are waterless wells, clouds being driven by a storm, for whom the darkness of the netherworld has been reserved forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.18'>For when they speak haughty [words] of emptiness, they entice through the lusts of the flesh, through lewdness, those who are escaping from those who are living in error,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.19'>promising to them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of corruption; for by whom anyone has been defeated, by this [one] also he has been enslaved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.20'>For if having escaped from the corruptions of the world by the knowledge of the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, yet by these, having become entangled they are defeated, the latter end has become worse for them than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.21'>For it was better for them not to have known the way of righteousness, than knowing it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.2.22'>But it has happened to them [according to] the [saying] of the true proverb: "A dog returns to his own vomit,"and, "A sow, having washed, [returns ] to her wallowing in the mire."</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Pet.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.1'>This already, beloved, [is] the second letter I write to you, in [both of] which I stir up your pure mind by a reminder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.2'>to remember the words having been previously spoken by the holy prophets, and the commandment of your apostles of the Lord and Savior;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.3'>knowing this first: that mockers will come in the last days, walking according to their own lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.4'>and saying, "Where is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers died, all things continue as from the beginning of creation."</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.5'>For this they willingly forget: that by the word of God the heavens were of old, and [the] earth, consisting out of water and through water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.6'>by which the world at that time perished, being flooded by water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.7'>but the present heavens and earth, having been stored up by His word, are being reserved for fire until the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.8'>But in this let it not escape your notice, beloved, that one day with the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.9'>The Lord does not delay concerning His promise, as some reckon slackness, but is longsuffering toward us, not willing that any should perish, but that all should come to repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.10'>But the day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night, in which the heavens shall pass away with a rushing noise, and the elements, burning with heat, shall be dissolved, both the earth and the works that are in it shall be burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.11'>Therefore, [seeing that] all these things shall be dissolved, what sort of [people] ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.12'>looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens, being set of fire, shall be dissolved, and the elements, burning with heat, shall melt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.13'>But according to His promise, we look for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.14'>Therefore, beloved, looking forward to these things, be diligent to be found by Him in peace, without spot or blemish;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.15'>and consider that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation-just as also our beloved brother Paul, according to the wisdom given to him, wrote to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.16'>as also in all his letters, speaking in them about these things, in which are some things hard to understand, which the unlearned and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do also the rest of the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.17'>You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, be on guard, lest you also fall from your own steadfastness, being carried away by the error of the wicked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Pet.3.18'>but grow in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To Him [be] the glory both now and forever. Amen.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.1'>My little children, these things I write to you, that you may not sin. And if someone should sin, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.2'>And He Himself is the propitiation for our sins, and not only concerning ours, but also concerning [those] of the whole world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.3'>Now by this we know that we have come to know Him, if we keep His commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.4'>He who says, "I have come to know Him,"and does not keep His commandments, is a liar, and the truth is not in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.7'>Brothers, I am not writing a new commandment to you, but an old commandment which you have had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word which you heard from the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.8'>Again, a new commandment I am writing to you, which [thing] is true in Him and in you, because the darkness is passing away, and the true light already shines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.9'>He who says that he is in the light, and hates his brother, is in darkness until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.10'>He who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no cause for stumbling in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.11'>But he who hates his brother is in darkness and walks in darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.13'>I am writing to you, fathers, because you have come to know Him[ who is] from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil [one]. I am writing to you, little children, because you have come to know the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.14'>I wrote to you, fathers, because you have come to know Him[ who is] from the beginning. I wrote to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil [one].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.15'>Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.16'>Because everything that is in the world-the lust of the flesh, and the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life-is not from the Father but is from the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.18'>Little children, it is the last hour; and just as you have heard that the Antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have appeared; from this we know that it is the last hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.19'>They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have remained with us; but [they went out] in order that they might be made manifest, that none of them were of us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.2.26'>These things I wrote to you concerning those who deceive you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.27'>And [as for] you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as the same anointing teaches you concerning all things, and is true, and is not a lie, and just as it has taught you, you will abide in Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.2.28'>And now, little children, abide in Him, in order that when He appears, we may have confidence and not be ashamed due to Him at His coming.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.3.3'>And everyone who has this hope in Him purifies himself, just as He is pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.4'>Everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.5'>And you know that He appeared that He might take away our sins, and in Him there is no sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.6'>Everyone who abides in Him does not sin; everyone who sins has not seen Him nor has he known Him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.3.8'>He who practices sin is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. For this [reason] the Son of God appeared, that He might destroy the works of the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.9'>No one who has been born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him; and he cannot sin, because he has been born of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.10'>By this the children of God and the children of the devil are manifest: Everyone who does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is he who does not love his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.11'>Because this is the message which you heard from the beginning, that we should love one another,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.12'>not as Cain who was of the evil one and slew his brother. And for what reason did he slay him? Because his works were evil and the [works] of his brother were righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.13'>Do not marvel, my brothers, if the world hates you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.14'>We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love the brothers. He who does not love his brother abides in death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1John.3.16'>By this we have come to know love, because He laid down His life for us. And we also ought to lay down our lives on behalf of our brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.17'>But whoever has this world's goods, and sees his brother having need, and shuts off his compassion towards him, how does the love of God abide in him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.18'>My little children, let us not love in word or in tongue, but in deed and in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.19'>And in this we know that we are from the truth, and shall assure our hearts before Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.20'>Because if our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and He knows all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.21'>Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence toward God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1John.3.22'>And whatever we should ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and we do the things pleasing before Him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw in the right [hand] of Him that sat on the throne a scroll, having been written inside and outside, [and ]having been sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>Then I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one in heaven above or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll, nor to look at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I began to weep much, because no one was found worthy to open the scroll, nor to look at it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>But one of the elders said to me, "Do not weep. Behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome, to open the scroll and its seven seals."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living beings, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as [if] slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>Then He came and took out of the right hand of Him that sat on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when He took the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp, and golden bowls being filled with incense, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sang a new song, saying: "You are worthy to take the scroll, and to open its seals; because You were slain, and You redeemed us to God by Your blood, out of every tribe and language and people and nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and have made them kings and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>Then I looked, and I heard as it were the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living beings, and the elders. And the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and a thousand thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a loud voice: "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive the power and the wealth and wisdom and strength, and honor and glory and blessing!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the earth and on the sea, and all that are in them, I heard saying: "Blessing and honor and glory and power to Him that sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb, forever and ever. Amen!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>-and the four living beings said "Amen!"And the elders fell down and worshipped.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living beings saying, like a voice of thunder, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And behold, a white horse. And he who sat on it had a bow; and a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering, and to conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when He opened the second seal, I heard the second living being saying, "Come!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>Another horse went out, fiery red, and it was granted to him that sat on it to take peace from the earth, so that they might kill each other; and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when He opened the third seal, I heard the third living being say, "Come."And behold, a black horse, and he who sat on it had a pair of scales in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four living beings, saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius; but do not harm the oil and the wine."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when He opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living being saying, "Come."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And behold, a pale horse, and he who sat on it was named Death, and Hades was following him. And authority was given to him over a fourth of the earth, to kill with [the ]sword, and with famine, and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when He opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for the testimony which they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried [with] a loud voice, saying, "How long, O Lord, holy and true, do You not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>Then a long white robe was given to them, and it was said to them that they should rest yet a while, until also their fellow servants and their brothers, who were about to be killed as also they [were], should complete [their course].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when He opened the sixth seal, that there was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the whole moon became like blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of heaven fell to the earth, like a fig tree casting its untimely figs, being shaken by a mighty wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>Then the sky was split like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were removed out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the magnates and the high-ranking military men, and the rich and the mighty, and every slave and every free man, hid themselves in the caves and in the crags of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And they said to the mountains and crags, "Fall on us and hide us from [the] face of Him that sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, so that a wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea, nor on any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>Then I saw another angel coming up from the east, having the seal of the living God. And he cried with a loud voice to the four angels to whom it had been granted to harm the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, "Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of those having been sealed, one hundred and forty-four thousand having been sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.10'>And they cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Salvation [belongs] to our God, to Him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.11'>And all the angels stood around the throne, and the elders and the four living beings, and they fell down on their faces before His throne and they worshipped God,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.13'>Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, "Who are these arrayed in long white robes, and where did they come from?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.14'>And I said to him, "My lord, you know."So he said to me, "These are those who come out of the Great Tribulation, and have washed their robes and they made them white in the blood of the Lamb.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.8'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.1'>And when He opened the seventh seal, silence occurred in heaven [for] about half an hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.2'>And I saw the seven angels who stood before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.3'>Then another angel, having a golden censer, came and stood at the altar. And much incense was given to him, so that he could offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which is before the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.4'>And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the angel before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.5'>And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire from the altar, and he cast it to the earth. And there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.6'>So the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.7'>And the first [one] sounded [his] trumpet, and there was hail and fire, having been mixed with blood, and they were thrown to the earth; and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees was burned up, and all green grass was burned up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.8'>Then the second angel sounded [his] trumpet, and [something] like a great burning mountain was cast into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.9'>And a third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.10'>Then the third angel sounded [his] trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the fountains of water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.11'>And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters turned into wormwood, and many men died from the waters, because they were made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.12'>Then the fourth angel sounded [his] trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of them was darkened. A third of the day did not shine, and likewise the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.8.13'>And I saw, and I heard an eagle flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, "Woe, woe, woe [for] those who dwell on the earth, from the remaining blasts of the trumpet of the three angels who are to sound [their] trumpets!"</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.9'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.1'>Then the fifth angel sounded [his] trumpet, and I saw a star having fallen out of heaven, to the earth. And the key of the shaft of the bottomless pit was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.2'>And he opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke arose out of the pit like the smoke of a burning furnace. And the sun was darkened, and the air, from the smoke of the shaft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.3'>Then out of the smoke came forth locusts to the earth. And power was given to them, as scorpions of the earth have power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.4'>They were told not to harm the grass of the earth, nor any plant, nor any tree, but [only] those men who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.5'>And they were not given authority to kill them, but that they should torment them for five months. And their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it strikes a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.6'>And in those days men shall seek death, and shall by no means find it; they shall be longing to die, yet death shall elude them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.7'>And the appearances of the locusts [was] similar to horses having been prepared for battle, and on their heads [were] like crowns of gold, and their faces [were] like the faces of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.8'>They had hair like women's hair, and their teeth were like the teeth of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.9'>And they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the sound of their wings [was] as the sound of chariots with many horses rushing into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.10'>And they had tails like scorpions, and stings. And in their tails they have power to harm men five months,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.11'>having as a king over them the angel of the bottomless pit; whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon, but in Greek he has the name Apollyon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.12'>One woe is past. Behold, yet two woes are coming after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.13'>Then the sixth angel sounded [his] trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.14'>saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels having been bound at the great river Euphrates."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.15'>So the four angels were released, who had been prepared for the hour and day and month and year, so that they might kill a third of mankind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.16'>Now the number of the troops of the horsemen was a hundred million; I heard the number of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.17'>And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and those who rode on them, having breastplates of fire, hyacinth, and brimstone; and the heads of the horses [were] like the heads of lions; and out of their mouths issued fire, and smoke, and brimstone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.18'>By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed-from the fire and the smoke and the brimstone proceeding out of their mouths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.19'>For the power of the horses is in their mouth and in their tails; for their tails are like serpents, having heads; and with them they do harm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.20'>But the rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent from the works of their hands, that they should not worship demons, and idols of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and of wood, which neither are able to see nor to hear nor to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.9.21'>And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their drugs, nor of their fornication or their thefts.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.10'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.1'>And I saw a mighty angel coming down from heaven, having been clothed with a cloud, and a rainbow on his head, and his face [was] like the sun, and his feet like pillars of fire,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.10.3'>and cried with a loud voice, as [when] a lion roars. And when he cried out, the seven thunders uttered their own voices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.4'>Now when the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up the things which the seven thunders said, and after these things you shall write."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.5'>And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.6'>and swore by Him who lives forever and ever, who created the heaven and the things in it, the earth and the things in it, and the sea and the things in it, that there should be no more delay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.7'>but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, whenever he is about to sound [his] trumpet, the mystery of God would be finished, as He declared to His servants the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.8'>Then the voice which I heard from heaven [was] speaking with me again and saying, "Go, take the little scroll which was open in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.9'>And I went to the angel, saying to him to give to me the little scroll. And he said to me, "Take [it ]and eat it up; and it shall make your stomach bitter, but it shall be as sweet as honey in your mouth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.10'>Then I took the scroll out of the angel's hand and ate it, and it was as sweet as honey in my mouth. And when I ate it, my stomach was made bitter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.10.11'>And they said to me, "You must prophesy again over many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.13.2'>And the Beast which I saw was like a leopard, his feet were like the feet of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. The dragon gave him his power, his throne, and great authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.3'>And one of his heads [was ]as if it had been slain to death, and his wound of death was healed. And the whole world marveled after the Beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.4'>And they worshipped the dragon who gave authority to the Beast; and they worshipped the Beast, saying, "Who is like the beast? Who is able to make war with him?"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.5'>And a mouth was given to him speaking great things and blasphemy, and authority was given to him to make war for forty-two months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.6'>Then he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme His name, and His dwelling, and those who dwell in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.7'>And it was granted to him to make war with the saints and to overcome them. And authority was given him over every tribe, people, language, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.8'>And all those who dwell on the earth shall worship him, whose name is not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb slain from the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.9'>If anyone has an ear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.10'>If anyone has captivity, he goes away; if anyone [is] with [the] sword, he must be killed. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.11'>Then I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke like a dragon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.12'>And he exercises all the authority of the first beast before him, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it, to worship the first Beast, whose deadly wound was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.13'>And he works great signs, so that he even makes fire come down from heaven on the earth before men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.14'>And he deceives my own [people] who dwell on the earth by the signs which were given to him to do before the Beast, saying to those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast who had the wound-and came to life! -from the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.15'>And it was granted to him to give breath to the image of the beast, that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.16'>And he causes all, small and great, rich and poor, free and bond, that they should receive marks on their right hand, or on their foreheads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.17'>and that no one may buy or sell except he that has the mark, the name of the beast, or the number of his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.13.18'>Here is wisdom. Let him that has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is [the] number of man-his number is 666.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.14'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.1'>And I saw, and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with Him one hundred and forty-four thousand, having His name and the name of His Father having been written on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.2'>And I heard a voice from heaven, like [the] voice of many waters, and like the voice of loud thunder. And the voice which I heard [was] as of harpists playing on their harps.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.3'>And they sang a new song before the throne, and before the four living creatures, and the elders; and no one was able to learn that song except the hundred and forty-four thousand who had been redeemed from the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.4'>These are those who were not defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are those who follow the Lamb wherever He may go. These were redeemed by Jesus from [among] men, firstfruits to God and to the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.5'>And no guile was found in their mouth, for they are blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.6'>Then I saw an angel flying in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on the earth, and to every nation, tribe, language, and people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.7'>saying with a loud voice, "Fear the Lord and give glory to Him, for the hour of His judgment has come; and you shall worship Him who made heaven and earth, and the sea and fountains of waters."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.8'>And another, a second angel followed, saying, "Babylon the great [has] fallen. From the wine of the wrath of her fornication, she has made all the nations to drink."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.9'>Then another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the Beast and his image, and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.10'>then he shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is poured out undiluted in the cup of His wrath. And they shall be tormented with fire and brimstone before the holy angels and before the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.11'>And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day or night, those who worship the Beast and his image, and anyone who receives the mark of his name."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.12'>Here is the endurance of the saints; those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.13'>And I heard a voice out of heaven saying, "Write: 'Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now [on,]' "Yes,"says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, and their works follow with them."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.14'>And I saw, and behold, a white cloud, and on the cloud sat [One] like the Son of Man, having on His head a golden crown, and in His hand a sharp sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.15'>And another angel came out of the temple, crying out with a loud voice to Him that sat on the cloud, "Thrust in Your sickle and reap, because the time has come to reap, because the harvest of the earth has withered."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.16'>So He that sat on the cloud swung His sickle onto the earth, and the earth was harvested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.17'>Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, he also having a sharp sickle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.18'>And another angel came out from the altar, having authority over the fire, and he called with a loud cry to the [one] having the sharp sickle, saying, "Thrust in your sharp sickle and gather the grape clusters of the vine of the earth, because the grapes are ripe."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.19'>So the angel threw out his sickle to the earth and gathered the vine of the earth, and he threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.14.20'>And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out of the winepress, up to the horses' bridles, about one thousand six hundred stadia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.15'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.1'>Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvelous: seven angels having the seven last plagues, because in them the wrath of God has been completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.2'>And I saw something like a glassy sea having been mixed with fire, and those who prevailed over the Beast, and over his image, and over the number of his name, standing on the glassy sea, having the harps of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.3'>And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying: "Great and marvelous are Your works, Lord God Almighty! Righteous and true are Your ways, O King of the nations!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.4'>Who shall not fear You, O Lord, and glorify Your name? For You alone are holy. For all [nations] shall come and worship before You, because Your righteous judgments have been manifested."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.5'>After these things I saw, and the temple of the tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.6'>And out of the temple came the seven angels having the seven plagues, who were dressed in pure bright linen, and having their chests girded with golden belts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.7'>Then one of the four living beings gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.15.8'>And the temple was filled by the smoke from the glory of God and from His power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.16'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God on the earth."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>So the first went off and poured out his bowl on the earth, and a bad and malignant ulcer came upon the men having the mark of the beast, and those who worshipped his image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>Then the second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood as of a dead man; and every living thing in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>Then the third [one] poured out his bowl into the rivers and into the springs of water, and it became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>And I heard the angel of the waters saying: "You are righteous, the One who is, and who was, holy, because You have judged these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>Because they shed the blood of saints and prophets, and You gave them blood to drink. They deserve it."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>And I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God Almighty, true and righteous [are] Your judgments."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>Then the fourth [one] poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was granted to him to burn men with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>And men were burned with severe burns, and men blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues; and they did not repent to give Him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>Then the fifth [one] poured out his bowl on the throne of the Beast, and his kingdom became darkened; and they gnawed their tongues from the pain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>They blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and their ulcers, and they did not repent of their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>Then the sixth [one ]poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water dried up, so that the way of the kings from the east might be prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs [coming] out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the Beast, and out of the mouth of the False Prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>For they are spirits of demons performing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.15'>Behold, I am coming like a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and guards his garments, lest he should walk naked and they should see his shame."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.16'>And he gathered them together to the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple of heaven, from the throne, saying, "It has been done!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>And there were lightnings and thunders, and noises; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not occurred since men came into being on the earth, so great an earthquake, so great!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>Now the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the great was remembered before God, to give her the cup of the wine of the rage of His wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>Then every island fled, and the mountains were not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>And great hail from heaven fell upon men, [each hailstone] weighing a talent. And men blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, since this plague was exceedingly severe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>Then one of the seven angels having the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great harlot who sits on many waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>with whom the kings of the earth committed fornication, and those dwelling on the earth became drunk from the wine of her fornication."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>And he led me away in [the ]Spirit, into a deserted [place]. And I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast being filled with names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup being filled with abominations and the filthiness of the fornication of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>And on her forehead a name was written: MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints and with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. And when I saw her, I marveled with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>But the angel said to me, "Why did you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman and of the Beast carrying her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>The Beast which you saw was, and is not, and is about to ascend out of the bottomless pit and go to perdition. And those who dwell on the earth shall marvel, whose name is not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, when they see the Beast that was, and is not, and shall be present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>Here is the mind which has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman sits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>And there are seven kings. Five have fallen, one is, and the other has not yet come. And whenever he comes, he must abide [for] a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>And the Beast which was, and is not, is also an eighth, and is of the seven, and is going to perdition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>And the ten horns which you saw are ten kings who not yet have received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings for one hour with the Beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>These have one purpose, and they will give their power and authority to the Beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>These will make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for He is Lord of lords and King of kings; and those who are with Him are called, and elect, and faithful."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>Then he said to me, "The waters which you saw, where the harlot sits, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>And the ten horns which you saw, and the Beast, these will hate the harlot, and will make her desolate and naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her up with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>For God has put it into their hearts to fulfill His purpose, to be of one mind, and to give their kingdom to the Beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>And the woman whom you saw is that great city which has royal rule over the kings of the earth."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was lit up from his splendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.2'>And he cried out with a strong voice, saying, "Babylon the great has fallen, and she has become a dwelling place of demons, a prison for every unclean spirit, and a cage for every unclean and detestable bird!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.3'>For all the nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth have become rich through the wealth of her luxury."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>And I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, lest you participate in her sins, and lest you receive of her plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>Because her sins have reached to heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.6'>Give back to her as also she gave back, and pay back double as also she [did], and according to her works. In her cup which she mixed, mix for her a double [portion.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>In as many things as she glorified herself and lived luxuriously, in the same measure give to her torment and sorrow; because she says in her heart, 'I sit as queen, and am not a widow, and I shall by no means see sorrow.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>"On account of this her plagues will come in one day-death, sorrow, and famine. And she shall be burned with fire, for strong is the Lord God who has judged her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>"The kings of the earth who committed fornication and lived luxuriously with her shall weep and mourn over her, when they see the smoke of her burning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.10'>standing from afar on account of the fear of her torment, saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city Babylon, that mighty city! Because in one hour your judgment came.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>"And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her, for no one buys their merchandise anymore:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>merchandise of gold and silver, precious stones and pearls, fine linen and purple, silk and scarlet, every kind of citron wood, every kind of object of ivory, every kind of object of most precious wood, bronze, iron, and marble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>and cinnamon and incense, perfume and frankincense, wine and oil, fine flour and wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>The fruit that your soul longed for has gone from you, and all the sumptuous things and the gaudy things have perished from you, and you shall by no means find them no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>The merchants of these things, who became rich from her, shall stand at afar on account of the fear of her torment, both weeping and sorrowing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.16'>and saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city, she who was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet, and having been gilded with gold and precious stones and pearls!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>Because in one hour such great wealth was laid waste.' And every captain, and all those sailing along the coast, and sailors, and as many as work on the sea, stood from afar</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>and were crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, 'Who is like this great city?'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>"And they threw dust on their heads and were crying out, weeping and sorrowing, and saying, 'Alas, alas, that great city, by which all who had ships on the sea became rich by her wealth! Because in one hour she was laid waste.'</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>"Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>Then a mighty angel picked up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "Thus with violence Babylon the great city shall be cast down, and shall by no means be found anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>The sound of harpists, and musicians, and of flutists, and of trumpeters shall by no means be heard in you anymore. And no craftsman of any craft shall by no means be found in you anymore, and the sound of a mill shall by no means be heard in you anymore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>And the light of a lamp shall by no means shine in you anymore, and the voice of bridegroom and of a bride shall by no means be heard in you anymore. Your merchants were the magnates of the earth, for by your sorcery all the nations were deceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints, and of all those who had been slain on the earth."</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.19'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>After these things I heard as [it were ]a loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>For true and righteous are His judgments, for He has judged the great harlot who corrupted the earth with her fornication; and He has avenged the blood of His servants [shed] by her hand."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>And a second [one] said, "Hallelujah! Her smoke goes up forever and ever!"</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>And the twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshipped God who sits on the throne, saying, "Amen! Hallelujah!"</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>And to her it was granted that she should be dressed in fine linen, bright and pure, for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>And I fell before his feet to worship him. But he said to me, "See [that you do] not! I am your fellow servant, and of your brothers who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>And I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse. And He who sat on him was called Faithful and True, and in righteousness He judges and makes war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on His head were many crowns, having names written, and a name written that no one knows except Himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>And He is clothed in a robe having been dipped in blood, and His name is called The Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.14'>And the armies in heaven were following Him on white horses, having been dressed in fine linen, white and clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>And out of His mouth proceeds a sharp, double-edged sword, so that with it He might strike the nations. And He will shepherd them with an iron rod. And He treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath of Almighty God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>Then I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the birds that fly in the midst of heaven, "Come and gather together for the great supper of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.18'>so that you may eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and of those who ride on them, and the flesh of all people, free and slave, both small and great."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>And I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies, having been gathered together to make war against Him who rode on the horse and against His army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>Then the Beast was apprehended, and with him the False Prophet who had performed the signs before him, by which he had deceived those who received the mark of the Beast and those who worshipped his image.

        <verse osisID='Rev.20.3'>and he cast him into the bottomless pit, and locked and sealed [it] over him, so that he should deceive the nations no more until the thousand years were finished. [But] after these things he must be released for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.4'>And I saw thrones, and they sat on them, and judgment was given to them, and the souls of those who had been beheaded on account of the testimony of Jesus, and on account of the word of God, and those who had not worshipped the Beast or his image, and they did not receive the mark on their forehead or on their hand. And they came to life and reigned with Christ [for] the thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.5'>But the rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were finished. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.6'>Blessed and holy is he that has part in the first resurrection. Over these the second death has no power, but they shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with Him for a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.7'>Now after the thousand years, Satan will be released from his prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.8'>and he will come out to deceive the nations which are in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the war, whose number is like the sand of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.9'>They went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. And fire came down from God out of heaven and devoured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>And the devil, who deceived them, was thrown into the lake of fire and brimstone where also the Beast and the False Prophet [are]. And they shall be tormented day and night forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.11'>Then I saw a great white throne and He who sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled. And no place was found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.12'>And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and they opened the books. And another book was opened, which is [the Book] of Life. And the dead were judged by the things having been written in the books, according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.13'>And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them. And they were judged, each one according to their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.14'>Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.15'>And if anyone was not found having been written in the Book of Life, he was cast into the lake of fire.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.21'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.1'>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away. And there was no more sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.2'>Then I saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, having been prepared like a bride having been adorned for her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.3'>And I heard a loud voice from heaven saying, "Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and He shall dwell with them, and they shall be His people, and God Himself shall be with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.4'>And He shall wipe away every tear from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, nor sorrow, nor crying out; neither shall there be any more pain, for the former things have passed away."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.5'>Then He who sat on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new."And He said to me, "Write, for these words are faithful and true."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.6'>And He said to me, "I am the Alpha and the Omega, the Beginning and the End. I will give from the spring of the water of life freely to him that is thirsty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.7'>He that overcomes I shall give to him these things, and I shall be God to him, and he shall be to Me a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.8'>But the cowardly, and unbelieving, and sinners, and abominable, and murderers, and fornicators, and drug users, and idolaters, and all who are false shall have their part in the lake which burns with fire and brimstone, which is the second death."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.9'>Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls being full with the seven last plagues came to me and spoke with me, saying, "Come, I will show you the wife, the bride of the Lamb."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.10'>And he carried me away in [the ]Spirit onto a great and high mountain, and he showed to me the holy city Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.11'>having the glory of God. Its radiance was like a most precious stone, like a jasper stone, [clear as] crystal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.12'>having a wall great and high, having twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and names written on them, which are the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.13'>three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.14'>And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.15'>And he who spoke with me had a measure, a golden reed, so that he might measure the city, and its gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.16'>The city is laid out [like] a square; its length is as great as its breadth. And he measured the city with the reed: twelve thousand furlongs. Its length, breadth, and height are equal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.17'>And its wall is one hundred and forty-four cubits, [by the] measure of a man, which is, of an angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.18'>And the construction of its wall was of jasper; and the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.19'>The foundations of the wall of the city [were] adorned with every precious stone: the first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.20'>the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.21'>The twelve gates are twelve pearls: each one of the gates was [made ]of one pearl. And the street of the city was pure gold, like transparent glass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.22'>But I saw no temple in it, for the Lord God Almighty is its temple, also the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.23'>The city had no need of the sun nor of the moon to shine, for the very glory of God illuminated it, and its lamp is the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.24'>And the nations shall walk in its light, and the kings of the earth shall bring to it [the] glory and honor of the nations into it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.25'>And its gates shall by no means be closed by day, for night shall not exist there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.26'>And they shall bring the glory and the honor of the nations into it, so that they may enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.27'>But there shall by no means enter into it any common [thing], and the [one] doing an abomination and a lie, but only those who are written in the Lamb's Book of Life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.22'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding from the throne of God and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>In the middle of its street, and on both sides of the river [was the] tree of life, producing twelve fruits, each yielding its fruit every month. And the leaves of the tree [are] for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And there shall be no more curse, but the throne of God and of the Lamb shall be in it, and His servants will minister to Him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>And they shall see His face, and His name shall be on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And night shall not exist. and there[ shall ]not [be a ]need of a lamp and of light, because the Lord God shall illuminate them. And they shall reign forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>Then he said to me, "These words are faithful and true."And [the] Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets sent His angel to show His servants the things which must come about soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>Behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed is he that keeps the words of the prophecy of this book."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And I, John, [am] the [one] hearing and seeing these things. And when I heard and when I saw, I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel showing to me these things.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I [am] the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>Blessed are those who do His commandments, so that their right shall be to the tree of life, and they may enter by the gates into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>But outside are dogs and drug users and fornicators and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices a lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>I, Jesus, have sent My angel to testify these things to you for the churches. I am the Root and the Stock of David, the Bright and Morning Star."</verse>
