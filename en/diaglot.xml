The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>The and Jesus being born in Bethleem of the Judea, in days of Herod the king, lo, wiseman from an east country came into Jerusalem, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>Where is the newborn king of the Jews? we saw for of him the star in the rising, and are come to do homage of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>Having heard and Herod the king was alarmed, and all Jerusalem with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>and having called together all the chiefpriests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Anointed should be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They and said to him: In Bethleem of the Judea; thus for is written by the prophet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>And thou Bethleem, land of Juda; by no means least art among the princes of Juda; out of thee for shall come forth a prince, who shall govern the people of me, the Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod privately having called the wisemen, learned exactly from them the time of the appearing a star,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>and sending them into Bethleem, he said: Passing on your way, exactly inquire about the infant; as soon as and you have found, bring word to me, that I also going pay homage to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>They and having heard the king departed. And lo, the star, which they saw in the rising, went before them, till going it stood over where was the infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>Seeing and the star, they rejoiced a joy very great;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>and being come into the house, they saw the infant with Mary the mother of it, and falling down did homage to it, and opening the treasuries of them, they offered to it gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, by another way they withdrew into the country of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>Having withdrawn but of the, lo, a messenger of a Lord appears in a dream to the Joseph, saying: Arising take the infant and the mother of it, and flee into Egypt, and be thou there, till I speak to thee; is about for Herod to seek the infant, to kill it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>He then arising took the infant and the mother of it by night, and went into Egypt;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>and he was there till the death of Herod; that might be fulfilled the word spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying: Out of Egypt I called the son of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>Then Herod seeing that he was mocked by the wisemen, was enraged much; and sending forth he slew all the boys the in Bethleem and in all the borders of her, from two years and under, according to the time which he exactly learnt from the wisemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then was fulfilled the word spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>A voice in Rama was heard, lamentation and weeping and mourning great; Rachel bewailing the children of her; and not is willing to be comforted because not they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>Having died and of the Herod, lo, a messenger of a Lord in a dream appears to the Joseph in Egypt, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>Arising take the infant and the mother of it, and go thou into land Israel; they are dead for the seeking the life of the infant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>He and arising took the infant and the mother of it, and came into land Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>Hearing and, that Archelaus was reigning over the Judea instead of Herod the father of him, he was afraid there to go; being warned and in a dream, he withdrew into regions of the Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>And coming he dwelt into a city named Nazareth; that might be fulfilled the words spoken through the prophets, that a Nazarene he will be called.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In now the days those comes John the dipper, proclaiming in the desert of the Judea, and saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>Reform ye; has come nigh for the majesty of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>This for is he spoken of by Esaias the prophet, saying: A voice crying out in the desert; make you ready the way of a Lord, straight make ye the beaten tracks of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>He and the John had the outer garment of him from hairs of a camel, and a belt made of skin around the loins of him; the and food of him was locusts and honey wild.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all the Judea, and all the country about of the Jordan;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>and were dipped into the Jordan by him, confessing the sins of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>Seeing and many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to the dipping of him, he said to them: O broods of venomous serpents, who pointed out to you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Bring forth then fruit worthy of the reformation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>and not think to say in yourselves: A father we have the Abraham; I say for to you, that is able the God out of the stones these to raise up children to the Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>Now and even the axe to the root of the trees lies; every therefore tree not bearing fruit good, is cut down, and into a fire cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I indeed dip you in water, into reformation; he but after of me coming, mightier of me is, of whom not I am worthy the sandals to carry; he you will dip in spirit holy and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>Of whom the winnowing shovel in the hand of him, and he will thoroughly cleanse the threshing floor of him; and he will gather the wheat of him into the storehouse, the but chaff he will burn up in fire inextinguishable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then comes the Jesus from the Galilee to the Jordan to the John, of the to be dipped by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>The but John refused him saying: I need to have by thee to be dipped, and thou comest to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>Answering and the Jesus said to him: Permit now; thus for coming it is to us, to fulfil all righteousness. Then he suffered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>And having dipped the Jesus went up immediately from the water; and lo, were opened to him the heavens, and was seen the spirit of the God descending like a dove, and coming on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>And lo, a voice out of the heavens, saying: This is the son of me the beloved, in whom I delight.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then the Jesus was led into the desert by the spirit, to be tempted by the accuser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>And fasting days forty and nights forty, after he was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>And coming to him the temper, said: If a son thou be of the God, speak, that the stones these loaves may become.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>He but answering said: It is written: Not by bread alone shall live a man; but by every word proceeding from mouth of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then takes him the accuser into the holy city, and places him on the wing of the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>and saying to him: if a son thou be of the God, cast thyself down; it is written for: That to the messengers of him he will give charge of thee; and on hands they shall raise thee, lest thou strikes against a stone the foot of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Said to him the Jesus: Again it is written: Not thou shalt put to the proof Lord the God of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Again takes him the accuser into a mountain high exceedingly, and shows to him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>and says to him: These all to thee I will give, if falling down thou wilt do homage to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then says to him the Jesus: Go thou behind of me, adversary; it is written for: Lord the God of thee thou shalt worship, and to him only thou shalt render service.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then leaves him the accuser; and lo, messengers came and ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Hearing now the Jesus, that John was delivered up, he withdrew into the Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>And having left the Nazareth, coming dwelt at Capernaum the by the seaside, in borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>that might be fulfilled the word spoken through Esaias the prophet, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>Land of Zabulon and land Nephthalim way of the sea by the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people who are sitting in darkness saw a light great; and to those sitting in a region even a shade of death, a light has arisen to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From that time began the Jesus to proclaim, and to say: Reform; has come nigh for the royal dignity of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>Walking and by the sea of the Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon the called Peter, and Andrew the brother of him, casting a fishingnet into the sea; they were for fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>And he says to them: Come behind of me, and I will make you fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>They and immediately leaving the nets, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>And going on from thence, he saw other two brothers, James the of the Zebedee and John the brother of him in the ship with Zebedee of the father of them, mending the nets of them; and called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>They and forthwith leaving the ship and the father of them, followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>And went about all the Galilee the Jesus, teaching in the synagogues of them, and preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom, and curing every disease and every malady among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>And went the report of him into all the Syria; and they brought to him all the sick having, various diseases and torments seized with, and demoniacs, and lunaties, and paralytics; and he cured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>And followed to him crowds great from the Galilee, and Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and Judea, and beyond of the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>Seeing and the multitudes, he went up to the mountain; and having seated himself, came to him the disciples of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and opening the mouth of him, he taught them, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>Blessed the poor to the spirit; because of them is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>Blessed the mourners, for they shall be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>Blessed the meek, for they shall inherit the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>Blessed the hungering and thirsting the righteousness, for they shall be satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>Blessed the merciful, for they shall obtain mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>Blessed the clean to the heart, for they the God shall see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>Blessed the peacemakers, for they sons of God shall be called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>Blessed those being persecuted on account of righteousness, for of them is the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>Blessed are ye, whenever they reproach you and persecute, and say every evil word against you, speaking falsely, because of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice ye and exult ye, for the reward of you great in the heavens; in this way for they persecuted the prophets those before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>You are the salt of the earth. If but the salt become tasteless, with what shall it be salted? for nothing is it of service any more, except to be cast out, and trodden under foot by the men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. Not possible a city to hide upon a hill being situated;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>nor they light a lamp, and place him under the measure, but on the lampstand; and it gives light to all those in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>Thus let it shine the light of you in the presence of the men, that they may see of you the good works, and may praise the Father of you that in the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>Not think ye, that I have come to destroy the law or the prophets; not I have come to destroy, but to fulfill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>Indeed for I say to you, till pass away the heaven and the earth, iota one or one fine point in no wise pass from the law, till all be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>Whoever therefore breaks one of the commandments of these of the least, and teach thus the men, least he shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens; who but ever shall do and teach, the same great shall be called in the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>I say for to you that except abound the righteousness of you more of the scribes and Pharisees, by no means you may enter into the kingdom of the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>You have heard, that it was said to the ancients: Not thou kill; who ever shall kill, liable shall be to the tribunal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>I but say to you, that all the being angry to the brother of him, without cause, liable shall be to the tribunal: who and ever shall say to the brother of him, Vile fellow, liable shall be to the Sanhedrim; who and ever shall say: O fool, liable shall be to the Gehenna of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>If therefore thou bring the gift of thee of the altar and there remember, that the brother of thee has somewhat against thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave there the gift of thee before the altar, and go, first be thou reconciled to the brother of thee, and then coming offer the gift of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Be thou willing to agree with the opponent of thee quickly, while thou art in the way with him; lest thee deliver up the opponent to the judge, and judge thee deliver up to the officer, and into prison thou shalt be cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Indeed I say to thee, by no means thou wilt come out thence, till thou hast paid the last farthing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>I but say to you, that whoever may release the wife of him, except on account of fornication, makes her to commit adultery; and whoever her being divorced, may marry, commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>Again you have heard, that it was said to the ancients: Not thou shall swear falsely; shalt perform but to the Lord the oaths of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>I but say to you not swear at all; not even by the heaven, for a throne it is of the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, for a footstool it is of the feet of him; neither by Jerusalem, for a city it is of the great king;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>You have heard, that it was said: An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>I but say to you, not resist the evil; but whoever thee shall slap upon the right of thee cheek, turn to him also the other;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>and to the purposing thee to sue at law, and the tunic of thee to take, give up to him also the mantle;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>and whoever thee shall force to go mile one, go with him two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>To the asking thee do thou give; and the wishing from thee to borrow money, not do thou repulse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>You have heard, that it was said: Thou shalt love the neighbor of thee, and hate the enemy of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>I but say to you, love the enemies of you, bless those cursing you, good do to those hating you and pray for those injuring you and persecuting you;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>A beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Anointed, a son of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in Esaias the prophet: Lo, I send the messenger of me before face of thee, who will prepare the way of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>A voice crying out in the desert; Make you ready the way of a lord, straight make you the beaten ways of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>Was John dipping in the desert, and publishing a dipping of reformation into forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And went out to him all the Judea country, and the Jerusalem all; and were dipped in the Jordan river by him, confessing the sins of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Was now John having been clothed hairs of a camel, and a belt made of skin around the loins of him, and eating locusts and honey wild.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he cried out saying: Comes the mightier of me after me, of whom not I am worthy bowed down to loose the string of the sandals of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed dipped you in water; he but will dip you in spirit holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those the days, came Jesus from Nazareth of the Galilee, and was dipped by John into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately ascending from the water, he saw rending the heavens, and the spirit, as a dove, descending upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And a voice came out of the heavens: Thou art the son of me the beloved in whom I delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the spirit him casts into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the desert days forty, being tempted by the adversary, and was with the wild beasts; and the messengers ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>After now the to be delivered up the John, came the Jesus into the Galilee, preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of the God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying: That has been fulfilled the season, and has come nigh the majesty of the God; reform you, and believe you in the good message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Walking and by the sea of the Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of him, casting a fishing net in the sea; they were for fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And said to them the Jesus: Come after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately leaving the nets of them, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And going thence a little, he saw James the of the Zebedee, and John the brother of him, and themselves in the ship were mending the nets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>and immediately he called them. And leaving the father of them Zebedee in the ship with the hirelings, they went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Capernaum; and immediately to the sabbath going into the synagogue, he taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were amazed at the teaching of him; he was for teaching them as authority having, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And was in the synagogue of them a man in spirit unclean, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying: Let alone, what to us and to thee, Jesus O Nazarene, comet thou to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And rebuked him the Jesus, saying: Be silent, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And convulsing him the spirit the unclean, and crying a voice great, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were astonished all, so as to reason among themselves, saying: What is this? what the teaching the new this? that with authority even to the spirits to the unclean he enjoins and they harken to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>Went out and the report of him forthwith into whole the country of the Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And instantly, out of the synagogue being come, he went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>The and motherinlaw of Simon was laid down having a fever; and immediately they spoke to him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And coming he raised her, having laid hold of the hand of her; and left her the fever immediately; and ministered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Evening and being come, when set the sun, they brought to him all those sickness having, and those being demonized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and the city whole having been assembled was at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many sick having various diseases; and demons many cast out, and not allowed to speak the demons, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And early, night much, having arisen he went out, and depart into a desert place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And eagerly followed him the Simon and those with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And having found him, they say to him: That all seek thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he says to them: We must go into the neighboring towns, that also there I may preach; for this because I have come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he was proclaiming in the synagogues of the, in whole the Galilee, and the demons casting out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And comes to a leper, beseeching him and kneeling him, and saying to him: That if thou wilt, thou art able me to cleanse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>The and Jesus being moved with pity, stretching out the hand, touched of him, and says to him; I will, be thou cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And having said of him, immediately departed from him the leprosy, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And having strictly charged him, immediately he sent forth him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and says to him: See, to no one anything thou tell; but go, thyself show to the priest, and offer for the purification of thee what enjoined Moses, for a witness to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>He but going out began to publish many (things) and spread abroad the word, so as no longer him to be able publicly into a city to enter; but without in desert place he was, and they went to him from all parts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again he went into Capernaum after days; and it was reported, that into a house he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And immediately were gathered together many, so as no longer to contain not even the places near the door; and he spake to them the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they come to him a paralytic bringing, being carried by four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And not being able to come nigh to him through the crowd, they uncovered the roof, where he was; and having dug through they let down the bed upon which the paralytic was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Seeing and the Jesus the faith of them, says to the paralytic: Son, are forgiven of thee the sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Were but some of the scribes there sitting and reasoning in the hearts of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why this thus speaks blasphemy? Who is able to forgive sins, if not one the God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately knowing the Jesus to the spirit of himself, that thus they reasoned among themselves, said to them: Why these (things) reason you in the hearts of you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier? to say to the paralytic: Are forgiven of thee the sins? or to say: Arise, take up of thee the bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>That but you may know, that authority has the son of the man on the earth to forgive sins; (he says to the paralytic:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>To thee I say: Arise, take up the bed of thee, and go into the house of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he was raised immediately, and taking up the bed, went out in presence of all; so as to astonish all, and to glorify the God, saying: That never thus we saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went out again by the sea; and all the crowds came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And passing on he saw Levi the of the Alpheus, sitting at the custom house, and says to him: Follow me. And arising up he followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it happened in the to recline at table him in the house of him, and many publicans and sinners reclined with the Jesus and the disciples of him; they were for many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes and the Pharisees seeing him eating with the publicans and sinners, said to the disciples of him: Why that with of the publicans and sinners he eats and drinks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And hearing the Jesus says to them: No need have those being well of a physician, but those sick being. Not I came to call just (ones) but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And were the disciples of John and the Pharisees fasting; and they come, and they say to him: Why the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast; those but to thee disciples not fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And said to them the Jesus: Not are able the sons of the bridechamber, in which the bridegroom with them is, to fast? so long a time with themselves they have the bridegroom, not are able to fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>Will come but days, when may be taken away from them the bridegroom, and then they will fast in that the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one a patch of cloth unfulled sews on to a mantle old; if but not, takes away the patch of itself the new of the old, and worse a rent becomes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts wine new into bottles old; if but not, bursts the wine the new the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are lost; but wine new into bottles new must be put.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass to go him in the sabbath through the cornfields, and began the disciples of him a way to make plucking the ears of corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him: See, why do they in the sabbath, what not is lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them: Never have you known, what did David, when need he had, and was hungry, he and those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of the God, to Abiathar of the highpriest, and the loaves of the presence did eat, which not is lawful to eat if not the priests, and he gave also to those with him being?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them: The sabbath because of the man was made, not the man because of the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So that a lord is the son of the man even of the sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue; and was there man having been withered having the hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>and they closely watched him, if to the sabbath he will heal him, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he says to the man to that having been withered having the hand: Arise in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he says to them: Is it lawful to the sabbath to do good or to do evil? a life to save, or to destroy? They but were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking round them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of the hearts of them, he says to the man: Stretch out the hand of thee. And he stretched it out; and was restored the hand of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And coming out the Pharisees, immediately with the Herodians a council held against him, how him they might destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And the Jesus with the disciples of him withdrew to the sea; and a great multitude from the Galilee followed him; and from the Judea, and from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from the Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and those about Tyre and Sidon, a multitude great, having heard what things he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spake to the disciples of him, that a small vessel should attend him, because of the crowd, that not they might throng him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>Many for he cured, so as to rush to him, that him they might touch, as many as had scourges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the spirits the unclean, when him gazing on, fell before him, and cried, saying: That thou art the son of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And many times he charged them, that not known him they should make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom would he; and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to cure the diseases, and to cast out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he put on to the Simon a name Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James that of the Zebedee, and John the brother of the James; and he put on them names Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James that of the Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and the Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who even delivered up him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And they come into a house. And came together again a crowd, so as not to be able them not even bread to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And having heard those with him, went out to restrain him; they said for: That he is out of place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes, those from Jerusalem having come down, said: That Beelzebul he has; also; That by the chief of the demons he casts out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And having called them, in parables he said to them: How is able an adversary and adversary to cast out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom against herself should be divided, not able to stand the kingdom that;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>and if a house against herself should be divided, not able to stand the house that;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach by the sea; and was assembled to him a crowd great, so as him entering into the ship, to sit in the sea; and all the crowd by the sea on the land was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them in parables many, and said to them in the teaching of him:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And another fell into thorns; and sprung up the thorns, and chocked it, and fruit not it gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And another fell into the ground the good; and it bore fruit springing up and increasing; and bore one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said: He having ear to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When and he was alone, asked him those about him, with the twelve, the parables.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Drew near now the feast of the unleavened cakes, that being called passover;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>and sought the highpriests and the scribes, the how they might kill him; they feared for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Entered and adversary into Judas that being surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>And going he talked with the highpriests and the officers, the how him he might deliver up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad; and agreed to him silver to give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>And he consented; and he sought opportunity of the to deliver up him to them without of a crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Came and the day of the unleavened cakes, in which it is necessary to sacrifice the paschal lamb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>and he sent Peter and John, saying: Going prepare you for us the passover, that we may eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>They and said to him: Where wilt thou we make ready?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He and said to them: Lo, having entered of you into the city, will meet you a man a pitcher of water carrying; follow you him into the house, where he enters; and say you to the householder of the house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>Says to thee the teacher: Where is the greatchamber, where the passover with the disciples of me I may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>And he to you will show an upper room large having been furnished; there prepare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>Having gone and they found even as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>And when came the hour, he reclined, and the twelve apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>And he said to them: With desire I have desired this the passover to eat with you, before the me to suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>I say for to you, that no more not not I may eat it, till it may be fulfilled in the kingdom of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>And having taken a cup, having given thanks he said: Take you this, and divide you among yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.18'>I say for to you, that not not I may drink of the product of the vine, till the kingdom of the God may come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>And having taken a loaf, having given thanks he broke, and gave to them, saying: This is the body of me, that in behalf of you being given; this do you in the my remembrance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.20'>In like manner also the cup, after the supper, saying: This the cup, the new covenant in the blood of me, that in behalf of you being poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>But lo, the hand of the delivering up me with mine on the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>And the indeed son of the man goes away according to that having been appointed; but woe to the man that, through whom he is delivered up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>And they began to inquire among themselves, the, which then it could be of them the this being about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>There had been and also a strife among them, the, which of them thinks to be greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.25'>He but said to them: The kings of the nations exercise lordship over them; and those having authority of them; benefactors are called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>You but not so; but the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and the governor, as he serving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>Which for greater? he reclining, or he serving? not he reclining? I but am in the midst of you as he serving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You but are those having continued with me in the trials of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I covenant for you, even as has covenanted for me the Father of me a kingdom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.30'>that you may eat and you may drink at the table of me in the kingdom of me; and you may sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of the Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>Said and the Lord: Simon, Simon, lo, the adversary has asked for you, the to sift as the wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>I but prayed for thee, that not may fail the faith of thee. And thou when having been turned, strengthen the brethren of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>He and said to him: O lord, with thee ready I am both to prison and to death to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>He but said: I say to thee, O Peter, not not will crow today a cock, before thrice thou wilt deny not to have known me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>And he said to them: When I sent you without a purse, and a bag, and sandals, not anything wanted you? They and said; Nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>He said then to them: But now, he having a purse, let him take, in like manner and a bag; and he not having, let him sell the mantle of himself, and let him buy a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>I say for to you, that yet this the having been written must to be finished in me, that: And with lawbreakers he was counted. Also for the things about me an end has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.38'>They but said: O lord, lo, swords here two. He and said to them: Enough it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.39'>And going out he went according to the custom to the mountain of the olivetrees; followed and him also the disciples of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>Having come and to the place, he said to them: Pray you not to enter into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And he was withdrawn from them about of a stone throw, and having placed the knees he prayed, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>O Father if thou art willing to take away the cup this from me; but not the will of me, but the thine be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Appeared and to him a messenger from heaven, strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in agony, very earnestly he prayed. Was and the sweat of him like clots of blood falling down to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>And having stood up from the prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from the grief; and he said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.46'>Why sleep you? having stood up pray you, that not you may enter into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While and of him speaking, lo, a crowd, and he being called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to the Jesus to kiss him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.48'>The but Jesus said to him: Judas, with a kiss the son of the man betrayest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.49'>Seeing and those about him the was going to be, said to him: O lord, if shall we strike with a sword?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.50'>And struck one a certain of them the slave of the highpriest, and cut off of him the ear the right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.51'>Answering and the Jesus said: Let you be till this. And touching the ear of him, he healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Said and the Jesus to those having come on him highpriests, and offices of the temple, and elders: As on a robber you have come out with swords and clubs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>every day being of me with you in the temple, not you did stretch out the hands on me; but this of you it is the hour, and the authority of the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>Having seized and him they led, and brought him into the house of the highpriest. The but Peter followed at a distance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.55'>Having kindled and a fire in midst of the court, and having sat down of them, sat the Peter in midst of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.56'>Seeing and him a maidservant certain sitting by the light, and looking steadily to him, she said: Also this with him was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.57'>He but denied him, saying: O woman, not I know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.58'>And after a little another seeing him, said: Also thou of them art. The but Peter said: O man, not I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.59'>And having intervened about hour one, another person confidently affirmed, saying: In truth also this with him was also for a Galilean he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.60'>Said but the Peter: O man, not I know what thou sayest. And immediately, while speaking of him, crew a cock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.61'>And having turned the Lord looked to the Peter; and was reminded the Peter of the word of the Lord, as he said to him: That before a cock to crow, thou mayest deny me thrice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.62'>And going out, he wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.63'>And the men those having in custody the Jesus, mocked him, scourging;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.64'>and having blindfolded him, they struck of him the face, and they asked him, saying: Prophesy, who is he striking thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.65'>And other many blaspheming they spoke against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.66'>And as it became day, were assembled the eldership of the people, highpriests and and scribes, and brought him into the sanhedrim of themselves,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.67'>saying: If thou art the Anointed, tell us. He said and to them: If to you I tell, not not you will believe;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.68'>if but also I ask, not not you would answer me, or would loose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.69'>From of the now shall be the son of the man sitting at right hand of the power of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.70'>Said and all: Thou then art the son of the God? He and to them said: You say; that I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.71'>They and said: What further need have we of testimony? Ourselves for we have heard from the mouth of him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>And having stood up whole the multitude of them, they led him to the Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>They began and to accuse him, saying: This we found misleading the nation, and forbidding to Caesar tax to give, saying himself an Anointed king to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>The and Pilate asked him, saying: Thou art the king of the Jews? He and answering to him said: Thou sayest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>The and Pilate said to the highpriests and the crowds: Nothing I find criminal in the man this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>They but were urgent, saying: That he stirs up the people, teaching in whole of the Judea, having begin from the Galilee to here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>Pilate and having heard of Galilee, he asked: If the man a Galilean is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And having learned, that of the authority of Herod he is, he sent him to Herod, being also him in Jerusalem in those the days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>The and Herod seeing the Jesus, rejoiced greatly; he was for wishing of a long time to see him, because the to hear many things about him; and hoped some sign to see by him being done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>He asked and him in words many; he and nothing answered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>Stood up and the highpriests and the scribes, vehemently accusing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>Having despised and him the Herod with the soldiers of himself, and having mocked, casting around him a robe splendid, sent again him to the Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>Became and friends the, both Pilate and the Herod in this the day with each other; formerly for in hatred being with themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>Pilate and having summoned the highpriests and the chiefs and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>said to them: You have brought to me the man this, as misleading the people; and lo, I in presence of you having examined, nothing I found in the man this a fault, of which you accuse against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>But not even Herod; I sent for you to him, and lo, nothing worthy of death is having been done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>Having scourged therefore him I will release.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>Necessary now it was to release to them at a feast one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>Cried out and all together, saying: Take away this, release and to us the Barabbas.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Again therefore the Pilate spoke to, wishing to release the Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>They but cried, saying: Crucify, crucify, him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>He and third said to them: What for evil has done this? nothing a cause of death I found in him; having scourged therefore him I will release.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>They but pressed with voices loud, demanding him to be crucified; and prevailed the voices of them and of the highpriests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>The and Pilate decided to satisfy the request of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>He released and the through sedition and murder having been cast into the prison, whom they asked; the but Jesus he delivered to the will of them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him, having laid hold of Simon a certain Cyrenian coming from country, they placed to him the cross, to carry after the Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>Followed and him a great multitude of the people, and of women; who also lamented and bewailed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>Turning but to them the Jesus said: Daughters of Jerusalem, not weep you for me, but for yourselves weep you, and for the children of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For lo, come days, in which they will say: Blessed the barren ones, and wombs which not bore, and breasts which not suckled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then they will begin to say to the mountain: Fall you on us; and to the hills: Cover you us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if in the green tree these they do, in the dry what will be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>Were led and also others two malefactors with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they came to the place, that being called Skull, there they crucified him, and the malefactors; one indeed at right, one at left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>The and Jesus said: O Father, forgive them; not for they know what they do. Having divided and the garments of him, they cast a lot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And stood the people gazing; scoffed at and also the rulers with them, saying: Others he saved, let him save himself, if this is the Anointed, the of the God chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>Mocked and him also the soldiers, coming near and vinegar offering to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>and saying: If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>Was and also an inscription having been written over him letters in Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew: This is the king of the Jews.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>Answering but the other rebuked him saying: Not even fearest thou the God, since in the same condemnation thou art?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly; due for which has been done we receive; this but nothing amiss has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to the Jesus: Do thou remember me, O lord, when thou mayest come in the kingdom of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And said to him the Jesus: Indeed I say to thee today, with me thou shalt be in the Paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>It was and about hour sixth, and darkness came over whole the land, till hour ninth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And was darkened the sun; and was rent the veil of the temple midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And crying with a voice loud the Jesus, said: O Father, into hands of thee I commit the breath of me. And these having said, he breathed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Seeing and the centurion that having occurred, glorified the God, saying: Truly the man this just was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the having come together crowds to the sight this, beholding the things having occurred, striking of themselves the breasts returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>Stood but all the acquaintance of him at a distance, and women those having followed him from the Galilee, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And lo, a man with a name Joseph, a counsellor being, a man good and just,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(this not was having assented to the will and the act of the,) from Arimathea a city of the Jews, who and was looking for also himself the kingdom of the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>this having gone to the Pilate, asked the body of the Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And having taken down it, he wrapped it in linen, and laid it, in a tomb hewn in a rock, where not was ever yet no one being laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And day was preparation, and sabbath approached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>Having followed after and also women, who were having been with him out of the Galilee, beheld the tomb, and now they laid the body of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>Having returned and they prepared aromatics and ointments; and the indeed sabbath they rested according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>In the and first of the weeks, of morning very early, came to the tomb, bringing what they prepared aromatics; and some with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>They found and the stone having been rolled from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And having entered not they found the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it happened in the to be perplexed them about this, and lo, men two stood by them in clothing shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>Afraid and having become of them, and bowing the face to the earth, they said to them: Why seek you the living among the deadones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>Not he is here, but has been raised. Remember you how he spoke to you, while being in the Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>saying: That it behooves the son of the man to be delivered into hands of men of sinners, and to be crucified, and the third day to stand up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered the words of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>and having returned from the tomb, they related these all to the eleven and to all the others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>Were and the Magdalene Mary, and Joanna, and Mary of James, and the others with them, who spoke to the apostles these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And appeared in presence of them as an idle tale the words of them, and they believed not them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>The and Peter arising ran to the tomb, and having stooped down he sees the linen bands lying alone; and he departed by himself, wondering that having occurred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And lo, two of them were going in this the day into a village being distant furlongs sixty from Jerusalem, to which a name Emmaus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they were talking to each other about all of the having happened of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it occurred in the to talk them and to reason, even he the Jesus having come near went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>The but eyes of them were held, the not to know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>He said and to them: What the words these, which you throw to one another walking, and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>Answering and the one, to whom a name Cleopas, said to him: Thou alone sojournest Jerusalem, and not thou knowest the things having been done in her in the days these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them: What things? They and said to him: The things about Jesus the Nazarene, who was a man a prophet, powerful in work and word in presence of the God and all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>How and delivered up him the highpriests and the chiefs of us to a sentence of death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>We but hoped, that he it is the being about to redeem the Israel; but besides all these third this day goes away today, from of which these occurred;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>but also women some of us astonished us, having been early at the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>and not having found the body of him, came, saying also a vision of messengers to have seen, who say him to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And went some of those with us to the tomb, and found thus even as also the women said; him but not they saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>And he said to them: O thoughtless and slow with the heart of the to believe in all, which spoke the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Not these it was binding to have suffered the Anointed, and to enter into the glory of himself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning from Moses and from all of the prophets, he explained to them in all the writings the things about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near to the village, where they were going; and he seemed intending further to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they pressed him, saying: Abide with us, for towards evening it is, and has declined the day. And he went in the to abide with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it happened in the to recline him with them, having taken the loaf, be blessed, and having broken he gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>Of them and were opened the eyes, and they knew him; and he disappeared from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said to each other: Not the heart of us burning was, in us, as he was talking to us in the way, and as he was opening to us the writings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And rising up in this the hour, they returned to Jerusalem; and found having been assembled the eleven and those with them,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>This seeing the Jesus lying, and knowing that long already time he had been, he says to him: Do thou wish sound to become?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Says to him the Pilate: What is truth? And this saying, again he went out to the Jews, and says to them: I not one fault find in him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>In many parts and in many ways long ago the God having spoken to the fathers by the prophets, in last of the days of these spoke to us by a son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>whom he appointed an heir of all things, (on account of whom also the ages he made,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>who (being an effulgence of the glory and an exact impress of the substance of him, sustaining and the things all by the word of the power of himself,) through himself a purification have made of the sins of us, sat down at right of the majesty in high places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>by so much greater having become of them messengers, by so much more excellent beyond them he has inherited a name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>To which for did he say ever of the messengers: A son of me art thou, I today have begotten thee? and again: I will be to him for a Father, and he shall to me for a son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>when but again he may lead in the first born into the habitable, he says: And let worship him all messengers of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>And concerning indeed the messengers he says: He making the messengers of himself spirits, and the public servants of himself of fire a flame;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>concerning but the son: The throne of thee the god for the age of the ages; a sceptre of rectitude the sceptre of the kingdom of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>Thou didst love righteousness, and thou didst hate lawlessness; on account of this anointed thee the God of thee, oil of extreme joy beyond the associates of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And: Thou in a beginning, O Lord, the earth didst form, and works of the hands of thee are the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They shall perish, thou but remainest; and all as a garment shall become old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>and like an upper garment thou wilt fold them, and they shall be changed; thou but the same art, and the years of thee not will fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>To which but of the messengers did he say ever: Do thou sit at right of me, till I may place the enemies of thee footstool for the feet of thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>Not all are public serving spirits, for service being sent forth on account of those being about to inherit salvation?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>On account of this it behooves more earnestly us to attend to the things having been heard, lest perhaps we should glide away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>If for the through messengers having been spoken word was firm, and every deviation and imperfect hearing received a just retribution;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how we shall escape so great having disregarded a salvation? which a beginning having received to be spoken through the Lord, by those having heard for us was confirmed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>coattesting the God by signs both and by prodigies, and by various powers, and of spirit holy by distributions, according to the of himself will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>Not for to messengers he did subject the habitable that about coming, concerning which we speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>Testified but somewhere one, saying: What is man, that thou dost remember him; or a son of man, that thou dost observe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>Thou didst make less him a little while then messengers; with glory and with honor thou didst crown him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>all things thou didst place under the feet of him. In for the to be subjected to him the things all, nothing is left to him unsubjected; now but not yet we see to him the things all having been placed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>The but a short time than messengers having been made less we see Jesus on account of the suffering of the death with glory and with honor having been crowed; so that by favor of God on behalf of all he might taste of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>It was fitting besides for him, for whom the things all and through whom the things all, many sons into glory leading the prince of the salvation of them through sufferings to perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>He both for sanctifying and those being sanctified out of one all; for which cause not he is ashamed brethren them to call,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>saying: I will announce the name of thee to the brethren of me, in midst of a congregation I will praise thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again: I will be having trusted in him; and again: Lo, I and the children which to me gave the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Since then the children have been sharers of flesh and blood, also he in like manner partook of the of them, so that by means of the death he might make powerless him the strength having of the death, that is the accuser,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and might set free them as many as by fear of death through all of the life held in were slavery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>Not for in any manner of messengers he takes hold, but of seed of Abraham he takes hold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Hence he was obliged in all things to the brethren to be made like, so that merciful he might be and faithful highpriest the things as to the God, in order to the to expiate the sin of the people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Whence, brethren holy, of a calling heavenly partakers do you attentively regard the apostle and highpriest of the profession of us, Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>faithful being to the one having appointed him, as even Moses in (whole) the house of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>Of more for this glory than Moses has been esteemed worthy, so fare as more honor he has of the house the one having built itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>(Every for house is built by some one; he but the things all having built, God.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>And Moses indeed faithful in whole to the house of him, as a servant, for a testimony of the things going to be spoken;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>Anointed but, as a son over the house of him; of whom a house are we, if indeed the confidence and the boasting of the hope till end firm we should hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as says the spirit the holy: Today, if the voice of him you will hear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>not you should harden the hearts of you, as in the bitter provocation, in the day of the temptation in the desert,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>not tempted me the fathers of you, proved me, and saw the works of me, forty years;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>therefore I was provoked with the generation that, and said: Always they wander in the heart; they but not they acknowledged the ways me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>so I swore in the wrath of me: If they shall enter into the rest of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>Take you heed, brethren, lest ever shall be in any one of you a heart evil of unbelief, in the to fall away from God living;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>but do you exhort yourselves in each day, till of which the today it is called, so that not may be hardened from of you any one by a delusion of the sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>Partakers for of the Anointed we have become, if perhaps the beginning of the confidence till an end firm we would hold fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>In respect to the to be said: Today, if the voice of him you may hear; not harden you the hearts of you, as in the bitter provocation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>Some for having heard did provoke? but not all those having come out from Egypt by means of Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>With whom but was he vexed forty years? not with those having sinned? of whom the members fell in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>To whom but did he swear not to enter into the rest of himself, if not to those having disbelieved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>And we see, that not they were able to enter because of unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>We may fear then, lest ever, being left a promise to enter into the rest of him, should seem any one from you to have failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>Also for we were having been addressed with glad tidings, even as also they; but not did profit the word of the hearing them, not having seen been mixed with the faith to those hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>We enter for into the rest those having believed, as he has said: So I swore in the wrath of me: If they shall enter into the rest of me; namely from the works from a laying down of a world having been done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>It has been spoken for somewhere concerning the seventh thus: And rested the God in the day the seventh from all of the works of himself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and in this again: If they shall enter into the rest of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Since then it is left some to enter into her, and those formerly having received glad tidings not entered on account of unbelief;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>again certain he defines a day, Today by David, saying, after so long a time; (as it has been said;) Today, if the voice of him you may hear, not harden you the hearts of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>If for them Jesus caused to rest, not would concerning another have spoken after these of a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>Therefore remains a keeping of a sabbath for the people of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>The for one having entered into the rest of him, also himself caused to rest from the works of himself, like as from the own the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>We should earnestly endeavor therefore to enter into that the rest, so that not by the same any one example may fail of the unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>Living for the word of the God, and energetic, and more cutting beyond every sword twomouthed, even cutting through to a division of life both and of breath, of joints both and of marrows, and able to judge of thoughts and of intentions of heart;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>and not is a creature out of sight in presence of him, all things but naked and having been laid open to the eyes of him, with whom for us the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Having therefore a highpriest great, having passed through the heavens, Jesus the son of the God, we should lay hold of the profession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>Not for we have a highpriest not being able to suffer with the weaknesses of us, having been tempted but in all things according to a likeness, apart from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>We should come therefore with confidence to the throne of the favor, so that we may receive mercy, and favor we may find for seasonable help.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>Every for highpriest from men having been taken, on behalf of men is placed over the things relating to the God, so that he may offer gifts both and sacrifices on behalf of sins;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>and on account of this it is fitting, as concerning the people, so also concerning himself to offer on behalf of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>And not to himself any one takes the honor, but he being called by the God, as even Aaron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>Thus and the Anointed not himself did glorify to become a high priest, but the one having spoken to him: A son of me art thou, I today have begotten thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>as also in another he says: Thou a priest for the age, according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>Who in the days of the flesh of himself, prayers both and supplications to him being able to deliver him out of death, with a cry strong and tears having offered, and having been heard from the piety,</verse>
