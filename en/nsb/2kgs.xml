      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Jeremiah) (580 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>The country of Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of King Ahab of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>King Ahaziah of Israel fell off the balcony on the roof of his palace in Samaria and was seriously injured. He sent some messengers and said to them: »Go to consult Baalzebub, the god of the Philistine city of Ekron, to find out whether or not I will recover from this.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>Jehovahs angel commanded Elijah, the prophet from Tishbe, »Go and meet the messengers of King Ahaziah. Ask them: Why are you going to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Do you think there is no god in Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>»Tell the king Jehovah says: You will not recover from your injuries. You will in fact die!« Elijah did as Jehovah commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>The messengers returned to the king. »Why have you come back?« He asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>They answered: »A man told us to come back and tell you that Jehovah says: Why are you sending messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron? Is it because you think there is no god in Israel? You will not recover from your injuries. You will die!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>»What did the man look like?« The king asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>»He was a hairy man wearing a cloak made of animal skins, tied with a leather belt,« they answered. »It is Elijah!« The king exclaimed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then he sent an officer with fifty men to get Elijah. The officer found him sitting on a hill and said to him: »Man of God, the king orders you to come down.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>»If I am a man of God,« Elijah answered: »Let fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men!« At once fire came down and killed the officer and his men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>The king sent another officer with fifty men, who went up and said to Elijah: »Man of God, the king orders you to come down at once!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>»Since I am a man of God,« Elijah answered: »let fire come down from heaven and kill you and your men!« At once the fire of God came down and killed the officer and his men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>Once more the king sent an officer with fifty men. He went up the hill, fell on his knees in front of Elijah, and pleaded: »Man of God, be merciful to my men and me. Spare our lives!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>»The other officers and their men were killed by fire from heaven. Please, please be merciful to me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>The angel of Jehovah said to Elijah: »Go down with him. Do not be afraid of him.« So Elijah went with the officer to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>Elijah spoke to the king: »This is what Jehovah says: Because you sent messengers to consult Baalzebub, the god of Ekron acting as if there were no god in Israel to consult, you will not get well. You will die!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>Ahaziah died, just as Jehovah spoke through Elijah. Ahaziah had no sons, so his brother Joram succeeded him as king. This happened in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Everything else that King Ahaziah did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <title>GOD TAKES ELIJAH INTO PHYSICAL HEAVENS</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>The time came for Jehovah to take Elijah up into the physical heavens the sky in a whirlwind. Elijah and Elisha set out from Gilgal,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>and on the way Elijah said to Elisha: »Stay here for Jehovah has ordered me to go to Bethel.« But Elisha answered: »I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you.« So they went on to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>A group of prophets who lived at Bethel asked Elisha: »Do you know that Jehovah is going to take your master away from you today?« »Yes, I know,« Elisha answered. »But let us not talk about it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>Then Elijah said to Elisha: »Stay here for Jehovah has ordered me to go to Jericho.« But Elisha answered: »I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you.« So the two of them went on to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>A group of prophets who lived at Jericho went to Elisha and asked him: »Do you know that Jehovah is going to take your master away from you today?« »Yes, I know,« Elisha answered. »But let us not talk about it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>Then Elijah said to Elisha: »Stay here for Jehovah has ordered me to go to the Jordan River.« But Elisha answered: »I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you.« So they went on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>and fifty of the prophets followed them to the Jordan. Elijah and Elisha stopped by the river. The fifty prophets stood a short distance away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>Then Elijah took off his cloak. He rolled it up and struck the water with it. The water divided, and he and Elisha crossed to the other side on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>Elijah said to Elisha: »Tell me what you want me to do for you before I am taken from you.« Elisha answered: »Let me receive a double share of your spirit power.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>»That is a difficult request to grant,« Elijah replied. »But you will receive it if you see me as I am being taken away from you. If you do not see me, you will not receive it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>They kept talking as they walked. Then suddenly a chariot of fire pulled by horses of fire came between them. Elijah was taken up into the physical heaven the sky by a whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>Elisha saw it and cried out to Elijah: »My father, my father! Mighty defender of Israel! You are gone!« He never saw Elijah again. In grief Elisha tore his cloak in two.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He picked up Elijah's cloak that had fallen from him. He returned to stand by the bank of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>Elisha struck the water with Elijah's cloak and said: »Where is Jehovah, the God of Elijah?« Then he struck the water again, and it divided, and he walked over to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>The fifty prophets from Jericho saw him and said: »The power of Elijah is on Elisha!« So they went to meet him and bowed down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>They said: »There are fifty of us here. We are all strong men. Let us go and look for your master. Maybe the Spirit of Jehovah has carried him away and left him on some mountain or in some valley.« Elisha answered: »You must not go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>They insisted until he gave in and let them go. The fifty of them went and looked high and low for Elijah for three days. But they did not find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>Then they returned to Elisha. He waited at Jericho. He said to them: »Did I tell you not to go?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>Men from Jericho went to Elisha and said: »You may know that this is a fine city but the water is bad and causes miscarriages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>He ordered them: »Put some salt in a new bowl and bring it to me.« They brought it to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>and he went to the spring, threw the salt in the water, and said: »This is what Jehovah says: I make this water pure. It will not cause any more deaths or miscarriages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>That water has been pure ever since, just as Elisha said it would be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>Elisha left Jericho to go to Bethel. On the way some boys came out of a town and taunted and made fun of him. They shouted: »Get out of here, baldy!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>Elisha turned around and glared at them. He cursed them in the name of Jehovah. Then two she-bears came out of the woods and tore forty-two of the boys to pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>Elisha traveled to Mount Carmel and later returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Joram son of Ahab became king of Israel in the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. He ruled in Samaria for twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>Though he was not as bad as his father or his mother Jezebel; he sinned against Jehovah. He removed the image his father had made for the worship of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Like King Jeroboam son of Nebat before him, he caused Israel to sin. He would not turn away from sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>King Mesha of Moab raised sheep. Yearly he gave as tribute to the king of Israel one hundred thousand lambs and the wool from one hundred thousand sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>When King Ahab of Israel died Mesha rebelled against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>At once King Joram mobilized his troops and left Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>He sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah: »The king of Moab rebelled against me. Will you join me to war against Moab?« King Jehoshaphat replied: »I will. I am on your side. My men and horses are at your disposal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>»Which way shall we go to the attack?« Joram answered: »We will go the long way through the wilderness of Edom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>King Joram and the kings of Judah and Edom assembled. After marching seven days, they ran out of water. There was none left for the men or the pack animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>»Alas, all is done,« King Joram exclaimed. »Has Jehovah called us together to be at the mercy of the king of Moab?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>King Jehoshaphat asked: »Do we have a prophet here to consult Jehovah?« An officer of King Joram's forces answered: »Elisha son of Shaphat is here who used to pour water on the hands of Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>»The word of Jehovah is with him,« King Jehoshaphat said. So the three kings went to Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>»Why should I have anything to do with you?« Elisha said to the king of Israel. »Go consult the prophets your father and mother consulted.« »No!« Joram king of Israel replied. »It is Jehovah who placed us three kings at the mercy of the king of Moab.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>Elisha answered: »By the living God Jehovah, whom I serve, I swear that I would have nothing to do with you if I did not respect your ally, King Jehoshaphat of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>»Now bring me a musician. As the musician played his harp, the power of Jehovah came on Elisha.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>He said: »This is what Jehovah says: Dig ditches all over this dry streambed wadi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>»You will not see any rain or wind. This streambed will be filled with water and you and your animals will have plenty to drink.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>Elisha continued: »This is an easy thing for Jehovah to do. He will also give you victory over the Moabites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>»You will conquer all their beautiful fortified cities. You will cut down all their fruit trees, stop all their springs, and ruin all their fertile fields by covering them with stones.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>The next morning when the sacrifice was offered water came flowing from the direction of Edom. It covered the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>The Moabites heard that the three kings came to attack them. All the young and old men who could bear arms were called out and stationed at the border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>They got up the next morning. The sun was shining on the water. It looked as red as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>They said: »It is blood! The three armies fought and killed each other! Let us go and loot their camp!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>When they came to the camp the Israelites attacked them and drove them back. The Israelites kept up the pursuit, killing the Moabites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>They destroyed their cities. As they passed by a fertile field, every Israelite would throw a stone on it until finally all the fields were covered with stones. They also stopped up the springs and cut down the fruit trees. At last only the capital city of Kir Heres was left. The slingers surrounded it and attacked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>The king of Moab realized that he was losing the battle. So he took seven hundred swordsmen with him and tried to force his way through the enemy lines and escape to the king of Edom. However they failed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>He took his oldest son, who was to succeed him as king, and offered him on the city wall as a sacrifice to the god of Moab. The Israelites were terrified and so they drew back from the city and returned to their own country.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>The widow of a member of a group of prophets said to Elisha: »My husband has died! As you know, he was a man who respected God. A man to whom he owed money came to take away my two sons as slaves in payment for my husband's debt.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>Elisha said: »Tell me what shall I do for you? What do you have at home?« She answered: »Except for a small jar of olive oil, I have nothing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>»Ask your neighbors for empty jars. Borrow as many as you can,« Elisha told her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>»You and your sons go into the house and shut the door behind you. Pour oil into the jars. Set each one aside as soon as it is full.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>The woman went into her house with her sons. They closed the door and took the small jar of olive oil, and poured oil into the jars as her sons brought them to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>When the jars were full she asked if there were any more. »That was the last one,« one of her sons told her. So the olive oil stopped flowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>She returned to Elisha, the prophet. He said: »Sell the olive oil and pay all your debts. There will be enough money left over for you and your sons to pay your living expenses.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>Elisha went to Shunem, where a rich woman lived. She invited him to a meal. From that time on every time he went to Shunem he would have his meals at her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>She said to her husband: »I know that this man who comes here often is a holy man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>»Let us build a small room on the roof, and put a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp in it. He can stay there when he visits us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>One day Elisha returned to Shunem and went to his room to rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>He told his servant Gehazi to call the woman. When she came,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>he said to Gehazi: »Ask her what I can do for her in return for all the trouble she has had in providing for our needs. Maybe she would like me to go to the king or the army commander and put in a good word for her.« »I have all I need here among my own people,« she answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>Elisha asked Gehazi: »What can I do for her?« He answered: »She has no son, and her husband is an old man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>»Tell her to come here,« Elisha ordered. She came and stood in the doorway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>Elisha said to her: »By this time next year you will hold a son in your arms.« »Please do not lie to me. You are a man of God!« She said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>Just as Elisha said, about that time the following year she gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <title>ELISHA BRINGS BOY BACK TO LIFE</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>Years later at harvest time, the boy went out one morning to join his father, who was in the field with the harvest workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>Suddenly he cried out to his father: »My head hurts! My head hurts!« »Carry the boy to his mother,« the father said to a servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>The servant carried the boy back to his mother. She held him in her lap until noon. Then the boy died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>She carried him up to Elisha's room and put him on the bed. She closed the door behind her and left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>She called her husband and said to him: »Send a servant here with a donkey. I need to go to the prophet Elisha. I will be back as soon as I can.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>»Why must you go today?« Her husband asked. »It is neither a Sabbath nor a New Moon Festival.« She replied: »Never mind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>She had the donkey saddled, and ordered the servant: »Make the donkey go as fast as it can. Do not slow down unless I tell you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>She left for Mount Carmel, where Elisha was. Elisha saw her coming while she was still far off. He said to his servant Gehazi: »Look, there comes the woman from Shunem!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>»Hurry to her and find out if everything is all right with her and her family.« She told Gehazi that everything was all right,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>but when she came to Elisha, she bowed down before him and took hold of his feet. Gehazi was about to push her away. Elisha said: »Do not bother her. You can see she is deeply distressed. Jehovah has not told me a thing about it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>The woman said to him: »Did I ask you for a son? Did I not tell you not to get my hopes up?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Elisha told Gehazi:« Hurry! Take my walking stick. Do not stop to talk to anyone. If anyone speaks to you do not respond. Go straight to the house and hold my stick over the boy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>The woman said to Elisha:« I swear by my loyalty to the living God Jehovah and to you that I will not leave you! So the two of them started back together. »</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.31'>Gehazi went ahead and held Elisha's stick over the child. There was no sound or any other sign of life. He returned to meet Elisha and said: »The boy did not wake up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.32'>When Elisha arrived he went alone into the room. He saw the boy lying dead on the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.33'>He closed the door and prayed to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.34'>Then he lay down on the boy, placing his mouth, eyes, and hands on the boy's mouth, eyes, and hands. As he lay stretched out over the boy, the boy's body started to get warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.35'>Elisha got up and walked around the room. He returned and again stretched himself over the boy. The boy sneezed seven times and then opened his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.36'>Elisha called Gehazi and told him to call the boy's mother. When she came in, he said to her: »Take your son!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.37'>She fell at Elisha's feet with her face on the ground. Then she took her son and left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.38'>When there was a famine throughout the land, Elisha returned to Gilgal. He was teaching a group of prophets. He told his servant to put a big pot on the fire and make some stew for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.39'>One of them went out in the fields to gather herbs. He found a wild vine and picked as many gourds as he could carry. He brought them back and sliced them into the stew, not knowing what they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.40'>The stew was poured out for the men to eat. They tasted it and exclaimed to Elisha: »It is poisoned!« They would not eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.41'>Elisha asked for some meal. He threw it into the pot and said: »Pour out some more stew for them.« Then there was nothing wrong with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.42'>A man came from Baal Shalishah. He brought Elisha twenty loaves of bread made from the first barley harvested that year and some freshly cut heads of grain. Elisha told his servant to feed the group of prophets with this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.43'>He asked: »How am I to feed a hundred hungry men with this?« Elisha replied: »Give it to them to eat, because Jehovah says that they will eat and still have some left over.« (Matthew 14:20)</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.44'>So the servant set the food before them. Just as Jehovah said, they ate and had some left over.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.1'>Naaman was a great soldier. He was commander of the Syrian army and highly respected and esteemed by the king of Syria Aram. Jehovah gave victory to the Syrian forces through Naaman. He suffered from a dreaded skin disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.2'>The Syrians carried off a little Israelite girl during one of their raids against Israel. The girl became a servant of Naaman's wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.3'>She said to her mistress: »I wish my master could go to the prophet who lives in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.4'>Naaman heard of this and told the king what the girl said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.5'>The king said: »Go to the king of Israel and take this letter to him.« Naaman departed. He took thirty thousand pieces of silver, six thousand pieces of gold, and ten changes of fine clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.6'>The letter stated: »This letter will introduce my officer Naaman. I want you to cure him of his leprosy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.7'>The king of Israel read the letter and tore his clothes and said: »How can the king of Syria expect me to cure this man? Does he think that I am God, with the power of life and death? It is plain that he is trying to start a quarrel with me!«</verse>
        <title>ELISHA HEALS NAAMAN</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.8'>When the prophet Elisha heard what happened, he sent word to the king: »Why are you so upset? Send Naaman to me. I will show him that there is a prophet in Israel!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.9'>Naaman went with his horses and chariots and stopped at the entrance to Elisha's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.10'>Elisha sent a servant to tell him to wash himself seven times in the Jordan River. He would then be completely cured of his disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.11'>Naaman left in a rage, saying: »I thought he would at least come out to me, pray to Jehovah his God, wave his hand over the diseased spot, and cure me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.12'>»Are not the Abanah and Pharpar rivers in Damascus better than any river in Israel? I could have washed in them and been cured!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.13'>His servants went up to him and said: »If the prophet had told you to do something difficult, you would have done it. Now why can you not just wash yourself, as he said, and be cured?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.14'>So Naaman went to the Jordan River and dipped himself in it seven times, as Elisha had instructed. He was completely cured. His flesh became firm and healthy like that of a child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.15'>Naaman returned to Elisha with all his men and said: »Now I realize there is no god but the God of Israel. Please accept a gift from me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.16'>Elisha the prophet answered: »By the living God Jehovah whom I serve, I swear that I will not accept a gift.« Naaman insisted that he accept it, but he would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.17'>So Naaman said: »If you will not accept my gift, then let me have two mule-loads of earth to take home with me. From now on I will not offer sacrifices or burnt offerings to any god except Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.18'>»I hope Jehovah will forgive me when I accompany my king to the temple of Rimmon, the god of Syria, and worship him. Surely Jehovah will forgive me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.19'>Elisha said: »Go in peace.« And Naaman left. He had gone only a short distance,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.20'>when Elisha's servant Gehazi said to himself: »My master has let Naaman get away without paying a thing! He should have accepted what that Syrian offered him. By the living God Jehovah I will run after him and get something from him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.21'>He ran after Naaman. When Naaman saw a man running after him, he got down from his chariot to meet him, and asked: »What is wrong?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.22'>»Nothing is wrong,« answered Gehazi. »But my master sent me to tell you that just now two members of the group of prophets in the hill country of Ephraim arrived. He would like you to give them three thousand pieces of silver and two changes of fine clothes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.23'>»Please take six thousand pieces of silver,« Naaman replied. He tied the silver in two bags and gave them and two changes of fine clothes to two of his servants, and sent them on ahead of Gehazi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.24'>They reached the hill where Elisha lived. Gehazi took the two bags and carried them into the house. Then he sent Naaman's servants back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.25'>He went into the house. Elisha asked him: »Where have you been?« »Oh, nowhere,« he answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.26'>Elisha said: »Was I there in spirit when the man got out of his chariot to meet you? This is no time to accept money and clothes, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and cattle, or servants!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.5.27'>»Naaman's leprosy will come upon you. You and your descendants will have it from generation to generation!« When Gehazi left, he had the disease. His skin was as white as snow.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.6'>
        <title>PROPHETS COMPLAIN TO ELISHA</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.1'>The group of prophets Elisha was in charge of complained to him: »The place where we live is too small!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.2'>»Allow us to go to the Jordan and cut down some trees. We can build a place to live.« Elisha answered: »Go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.3'>One of them urged him to go with them and he agreed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.4'>They set out together and when they arrived at the Jordan they cut down trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.5'>One of them was cutting down a tree when suddenly his ax head fell in the water. It was a borrowed ax, he exclaimed to Elisha. »What will I do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.6'>Elisha said: »Where did it fall?« The man showed him the place. Elisha cut off a stick. Then he threw it in the water and made the ax head float.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.7'>»Pick it up,« he ordered. The man put his hand in the water and picked it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.8'>The king of Syria was at war with Israel. He consulted his officers and chose a place to set up camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.9'>Elisha sent word to the king of Israel. He warned him not to go near that place, because the Syrians were waiting to ambush him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.10'>The king of Israel warned the people who lived there. So they were on guard. This happened several times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.11'>The Syrian king was greatly upset over this. He called in his officers and asked them: »Show me who of us is on the side of the king of Israel?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.12'>One of his servants said: »No one is, Your Majesty. The prophet Elisha tells the king of Israel what you say even in the privacy of your own bedroom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.13'>»Locate him!« the king ordered, »and I will capture him. He was told: »Elisha is in Dothan.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.14'>He sent a large force there with horses and chariots. They surrounded the town at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.15'>Early the next morning Elisha's servant got up and went out of the house. He saw the Syrian troops with their horses and chariots surrounding the town. He went to Elisha and said: »Alas my master what shall we do?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.16'>»Do not be afraid,« Elisha answered. »We have more on our side than they have on theirs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.17'>Elisha prayed: »O Jehovah, open his eyes that he may see.« Jehovah answered his prayer. Elisha's servant looked up and saw the hillside covered with horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.18'>The Syrians attacked! Elisha prayed, »O Jehovah, strike these men blind!« Jehovah answered his prayer and struck them blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.19'>Elisha said to the Syrians: »This is not the way or the town you are looking for. Follow me, and I will lead you to the man you are after.« He led them to Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.20'>When they entered the city, Elisha prayed: »Open their eyes and let them see.« Jehovah answered his prayer. He restored their sight, and they saw that they were inside Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.21'>When the king of Israel saw the Syrians, he asked Elisha: »Shall I kill them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.22'>»No,« Elisha answered. »Would you put to death soldiers you captured in combat? Give them something to eat and drink. Then let them return to their king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.23'>So the king of Israel provided a great feast for them. After they ate and drank he sent them back to the king of Syria. From then on the Syrians stopped raiding the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.24'>After that King Benhadad of Syria led his entire army against Israel in siege of the city of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.25'>The siege caused a great food shortage in the city. It was so severe that a donkey's head cost eighty pieces of silver, and half a pound of dove's dung cost five pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.26'>The king of Israel walked by on the city wall when a woman cried out: »Help me, Your Majesty!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.27'>The king replied: »If Jehovah will not help you, what help can I provide? Where can I get you help from the threshing floor or the wine press?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.28'>The king asked: »What is your trouble?« She answered: »The other day a woman suggested that we eat my child. Then we could eat her child the next day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.29'>»So we cooked my son and ate him. The next day I told her that we would eat her son, but she had hidden him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.30'>Hearing this, the king tore his clothes. The people close to the wall could see that he was wearing sackcloth under his clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.31'>He exclaimed: »May God strike me dead if Elisha is not beheaded before the day is over!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.32'>He sent a messenger to get Elisha. Meanwhile Elisha was at home with some elders who were visiting him. Before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders: »That murderer is sending someone to kill me! When he gets here, shut the door. Do not let him come in. The king will follow him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.6.33'>While Elisha was still talking the king arrived and said: »Jehovah brought this trouble on us! Why should I wait any longer for him to do something?«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.7'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.1'>Elisha answered: »Hear the word of Jehovah: By this time tomorrow you will be able to buy in Samaria ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley for one piece of silver.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.2'>The personal attendant of the king said to Elisha: »If Jehovah could make floodgates in the heavens could this happen?« Elisha replied: »You will see it with your own eyes. But you will not eat from it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.3'>Four men who were suffering from a dreaded skin disease were outside the gates of Samaria. They said to each other: »Why should we wait here until we die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.4'>»If we go into the city we will starve to death. If we stay here we will also die. So let us go to the Syrian camp. The worst they can do is kill us. Maybe they will spare our lives.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.5'>They arose in the twilight and went to the Syrian camp. When they reached it, no one was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.6'>Jehovah made the Syrians hear what sounded like the advance of a large army with horses and chariots. The Syrians thought that the king of Israel had hired Hittite and Egyptian kings and their armies to attack them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.7'>The Syrians arose and fled while it was yet dark. They left their tents, and their horses, and their donkeys in the camp and fled for their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.8'>The lepers came to the edge of the camp. They went into one tent and ate and drank. They took silver and gold and clothing. They entered another tent and carried away spoil and hid it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.9'>They said to each other: »We should not do this! We have good news. We should not keep it to ourselves. If we wait until morning to tell it we will be punished. Let us go tell the king's officers!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.10'>They left the Syrian camp and went to Samaria. They called out to the guards at the gates: »We went to the Syrian camp and did not see or hear anyone. The horses and donkeys have not been untied. The tents are just as the Syrians left them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.11'>The guards announced the news. It was reported in the palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.12'>The king got out of bed even though it was night. He said to his officials: »I will tell you what the Syrians are planning! They know about the famine here, so they have left their camp to go and hide in the countryside. They think that we will leave the city to find food. Then they will take us alive and capture the city.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.13'>One of his servants said: »The people in the city are doomed like those who have already died. Send some men with five of the horses that are left and find out what happened.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.14'>They chose some men and the king sent them in two chariots with instructions to go and find out what had happened to the Syrian army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.15'>The men went to the Jordan. Along the road they saw the clothes and equipment that the Syrians had abandoned as they fled. Then they returned and reported to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.16'>The people of Samaria rushed out and looted the Syrian camp. Just as Jehovah said, ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley were sold for one piece of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.17'>The king of Israel put the city gate under the command of the officer who was his personal attendant. The officer was trampled to death there by the people and died, as Elisha had predicted when the king went to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.18'>Elisha told the king that by that time the following day ten pounds of the best wheat or twenty pounds of barley would be sold in Samaria for one piece of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.19'>The kings attendant answered: »If Jehovah could open floodgates in the heavens could this happen?« Elisha had replied: »You shall see with your own eyes. But you will not eat from it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.7.20'>And that is just what happened! He died. The people at the city gate trampled him to death.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.8'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.1'>Elisha told the woman who lived in Shunem, whose son he brought back to life: »Jehovah is sending a famine on the land. It will last for seven years. Leave with your family and go live somewhere else.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.2'>She followed his instructions and left with her family to live in Philistia for the seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.3'>When the seven years ended she returned to Israel. She went to the king to ask that her house and her land be restored to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.4'>The king was talking with Gehazi, Elisha's servant, when she found him. The king wanted to know about Elisha's miracles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.5'>Gehazi was telling the king how Elisha had brought a dead person back to life. The woman made her appeal to the king. Gehazi said to him: »Your Majesty, here is the woman and here is her son whom Elisha brought back to life!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.6'>She responded to the kings question by confirming Gehazis story. The king called an official and told him to give back to her everything that was hers. This included the value of all the crops that her fields produced during the seven years she was away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.7'>Elisha went to Damascus when King Benhadad of Syria was sick. The king was told that Elisha was there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.8'>He said to Hazael, one of his officials: »Take a gift to the prophet and ask him to consult Jehovah to find out whether or not I am going to get well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.9'>Hazael loaded forty camels with all kinds of the finest products of Damascus and went to Elisha. Hazael said: »Your servant, King Benhadad sent me to ask if he will recover from his sickness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.10'>Elisha answered: »Jehovah has revealed to me that he will die. However go to him and tell him that he will recover.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.11'>Elisha stared at him in horror until Hazael became ill at ease. Suddenly Elisha burst into tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.12'>»Why are you crying?« Hazael asked. »Because I know the horrible things you will do against the people of Israel,« Elisha answered. »You will burn their fortresses, slaughter their finest young men, batter their children to death, and rip open their pregnant women.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.13'>»How could I ever be that powerful?« Hazael asked. »I am nobody, only a dog.« Elisha replied: »Jehovah has revealed to me that you will be king of Syria.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.14'>Hazael returned to Benhadad, who asked him: »What did Elisha say?« »He told me that you will certainly get well,« Hazael answered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.15'>The following day Hazael took a blanket, soaked it in water, and smothered the king. Hazael succeeded Benhadad as king of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.16'>Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat became king of Judah. It was the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.17'>He was thirty-two years old. He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.18'>His wife was Ahab's daughter. Like the family of Ahab he followed the evil ways of the kings of Israel. He sinned against Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.19'>Jehovah was not willing to destroy Judah. He promised his servant David that his descendants would always continue to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.20'>Edom revolted against Judah and became an independent kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.21'>Jehoram and his chariots went to Zair. The Edomite army surrounded them. He and his chariot commanders managed to break out and escape. His soldiers scattered to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.22'>Edom has been independent of Judah ever since. The city of Libnah also revolted at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.23'>Everything Jehoram did is recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.24'>Jehoram died and was buried in the royal tombs in David's City. His son Ahaziah succeeded him as king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.25'>Ahaziah son of Jehoram became king of Judah. This was in the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab as king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.26'>He was twenty-two years old. He ruled in Jerusalem for one year. His mother was Athaliah, the daughter of King Ahab and granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.27'>Ahaziah was related to King Ahab by marriage. He sinned against Jehovah as Ahab's family did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.28'>King Ahaziah joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria. The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead. Joram was wounded in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.8.29'>He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds. Ahaziah went there to visit him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.1'>Elisha the prophet called one of the young prophets and said to him: »Prepare to go to Ramoth in Gilead. Take this jar of olive oil with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.2'>»When you get there look for Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat and grandson of Nimshi. Take him to a private room away from his companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.3'>»Pour this olive oil on his head, and say: Jehovah anoints you king of Israel. Then leave there as fast as you can.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.4'>The young prophet went to Ramoth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.5'>He found the army officers in conference. He said: »I have a message for you.« Jehu asked: »Who are you speaking to?« »To you, captain.« He replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.6'>The two of them went indoors. The prophet poured the olive oil on Jehu's head and said to him: »Jehovah, the God of Israel, says: I anoint you king of my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.7'>»You are to kill your master the king of the house of Ahab. I am punishing Jezebel for murdering my prophets and my other servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.8'>»The entire house of Ahab will perish. I will get rid of every male in his family, young and old alike.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.9'>»I will treat his family as I did the families of King Jeroboam son of Nebat and of King Baasha son of Ahijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.10'>»Jezebel will not be buried. Dogs in the territory of Jezreel will eat her body.« After saying this, the young prophet opened the door and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.11'>Jehu went back to his fellow officers. They asked him: »Is everything all right? What did this mad fellow want with you?« Jehu answered: »You know what he wanted.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.12'>»No we do not!« They replied. »Tell us what he said!« They asked. »He told me that Jehovah says: I anoint you king of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.13'>At once Jehu's fellow officers spread their cloaks at the top of the steps for Jehu to stand on. They blew trumpets and shouted: »Jehu is king!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.14'>So Jehu, the son of Jehoshaphat, the son of Nimshi, plotted against Joram. Joram and all the army of Israel were keeping watch on Ramoth-gilead against Hazael, king of Aram:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.15'>King Joram went back to Jezreel to recuperate from the wounds he received from the Aramaeans when he fought against Hazael, king of Aram. Jehu said: »If this is your purpose let no one get away to give news of it in Jezreel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.16'>So Jehu got into his carriage and went to Jezreel. Joram was ill in bed there and Ahaziah, king of Judah came to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.17'>The watchman on the tower in Jezreel saw Jehu and his company coming. He said: »I see a company of people.« Joram said: »Send out a horseman to them and let him ask: Do you come in peace?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.18'>So a horseman went out to them and said: »The king asks: Do you come in peace? « Jehu said: »What have you to do with peace? Follow me.« The watchman reported that the horseman reached the group and was returning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.19'>A second man was sent out on horseback. He approached them and asked the same thing: »Do you come in peace?« Jehu replied: »What have you to do with peace? Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.20'>The watchman reported: »He went up to them and has not come back. The driving is like the driving of Jehu, son of Nimshi, for he is driving violently.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.21'>Joram said: »Get ready.« They prepared his chariot and Joram, king of Israel, with Ahaziah, king of Judah, went out in their chariots to meet Jehu. They came face to face with him at the field of Naboth the Jezreelite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.22'>When Joram saw Jehu he said: »Do you come in peace, Jehu?« He said in reply: »What peace is possible while all the land is full of the disgusting sins of your mother Jezebel, and her secret arts of witchcraft?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.23'>Then Joram turned his horses and fled. He said to Ahaziah: »Broken faith, O Ahaziah!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.24'>Jehu drew his bow with his full strength and sent an arrow, wounding Joram between the arms. The arrow came out at his heart, and he went down on his face in his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.25'>Jehu said to Bidkar, his captain: »Pick him up, and put him in the field of Naboth the Jezreelite. I remember when you and I were riding together after Ahab, his father. Jehovah offered this prophesy against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.26'>»Even as I saw the blood of Naboth and his sons yesterday, I will pay you back in this field, declares Jehovah. Now take him and throw him into the field as Jehovah predicted.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.27'>When King Ahaziah of Judah saw this, he fled on the road leading to Beth Haggan. Jehu pursued him and ordered: »Shoot him down in his chariot.« They shot him at Gur Pass, near Ibleam. Ahaziah continued to flee until he got to Megiddo, where he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.28'>His servants brought him in a chariot to Jerusalem. They buried him in a tomb with his ancestors in the City of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.29'>Ahaziah became king over Judah. It was in the eleventh year of the rule of Joram, the son of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.30'>Jehu went to Jezreel. Jezebel had news of what happened. Painting her eyes and dressing her hair with ornaments, she put her head out of the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.31'>As Jehu entered the town, she said: »Have you come in peace, you Zimri, who killed his master?«</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.33'>He said: »Take her and throw her out the window.« So they threw her down with force. Her blood splattered on the wall and on the horses. She was crushed under their feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.34'>He came in and ate and drank. He said: »Now see to this cursed woman. Bury her body in the earth, for she is a king's daughter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.35'>They went to bury her, but they found nothing to bury. There were only the bones of her head, and her feet, and parts of her hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.36'>So they came back and told him about it. He said: »This is what Jehovah said by his servant Elijah the Tishbite: In the heritage of Jezreel the flesh of Jezebel will become food for dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.9.37'>»The dead body of Jezebel will be like waste dropped on the face of the earth in the heritage of Jezreel. They will not be able to say: »This is Jezebel.« «</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.1'>Ahab had seventy sons in Samaria. Jehu sent letters to Samaria, to the rulers of the town, and to the elders, and to those who took care of the sons of Ahab. The letter stated:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.2'>»You are in charge of the king's descendants, and you have at your disposal chariots, horses, weapons, and fortified cities. As soon as you receive this letter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.3'>choose the best qualified of the king's descendants and make him king, and fight to defend him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.4'>The rulers of Samaria were terrified. They said: »How can we oppose Jehu when neither King Joram nor King Ahaziah could?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.5'>So the officer in charge of the palace and the official in charge of the city, together with the leading citizens and the guardians, sent this message to Jehu: »We are your servants, and we are ready to do anything you say. But we will not make anyone king. Do whatever you think best.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.6'>Jehu wrote them another letter: »If you are with me and are ready to follow my orders, bring the heads of King Ahab's descendants to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow.« The seventy descendants of King Ahab were under the care and were being brought up by the leading citizens of Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.7'>As soon as Jehu's letter arrived, the leaders of Samaria killed all seventy of Ahab's descendants and put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.8'>Jehu was informed that the heads of Ahab's descendants had been brought. He ordered them to be piled up in two heaps at the city gate and left there until the following morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.9'>In the morning he went out and said to all the people there: »You are upright people. It is true that I made designs against my master, and put him to death. Who is responsible for the death of all these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.10'>»You may be certain that nothing Jehovah said about the family of Ahab will be without effect. Jehovah has done what he said by his servant Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.11'>Jehu put to death all the rest of the seed of Ahab in Jezreel, and all his relations and his near friends and his priests, till there were no more of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.12'>Jehu then left for Samaria. He was at the meeting-place of the shepherds of the sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.13'>He came across the brothers of Ahaziah, king of Judah, and asked: »Who are you?« They replied: »We are the brothers of Ahaziah, king of Judah. We are going down to see the children of the king and of the queen.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.14'>He ordered: »Take them alive.« So they took them alive and then killed them at the cistern of the shearing house. He killed all forty-two of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.15'>When he left there he met Jehonadab, the son of Rechab. He greeted him and said to him: »Is your heart true to mine, as mine is to yours?« Jehonadab in answer said: »It is.« Jehu said: »If it is give me your hand.« He gave him his hand and he made him come up into his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.16'>He said: »Come with me and see how I am on fire with zeal for Jehovahs cause.« So he made him go with him in his chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.17'>When Jehu arrived at Samaria, he put to death all those of Ahab's family who were still in Samaria. There were no more of them, as Jehovah had said to Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.18'>Jehu assembled all the people and said to them: »Ahab was Baal's servant in a small way, but Jehu will be his servant on a great scale.</verse>
        <title>BAAL WORSHIPERS DESTROYED</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.19'>»Now send for all the prophets of Baal, all his servants and priests, to come to me. Let no one stay away for I have a great offering to make to Baal. Anyone who is not present will be put to death.« Jehu did this with deceit. It was his purpose to destroy the servants of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.20'>Jehu said: »Let there be a special holy meeting for the worship of Baal.« So a public statement was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.21'>Jehu sent through all Israel; and all the servants of Baal came, not one kept away. They entered the house of Baal. It was full from one end to the other end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.22'>Jehu said to the keeper of the robes: »Get out robes for all the servants of Baal.« So he got out robes for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.23'>Jehu, with Jehonadab, the son of Rechab, went into the house of Baal. He said to the servants of Baal: »Make a search with care, to see that no servant of Jehovah is with you, but only servants of Baal.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.24'>They went in to make offerings and burned offerings. Jehu put eighty men outside. He told them: »If any man whom I give into your hands escapes, he who lets him go will forfeit his own life for that life.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.25'>As soon as he finished offering the burned offering Jehu said to the armed men and the captains: »Go in and put them to death! Do not let one come out!« So they put them to the sword. Pulling the images to the ground, they went into the holy place of the house of Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.26'>They removed the image of Asherah from the house of Baal and burned it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.27'>The altar of Baal was pulled down and the house of Baal was broken up and made an unclean place, as it is to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.28'>Jehu put an end to the worship of Baal in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.29'>But Jehu did not keep himself from all the sins of Jeroboam, the son of Nebat, and the evil he made Israel do. The gold calves were still worshiped in Bethel and in Dan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.30'>Jehovah said to Jehu: »You have done well by doing what is right in my eyes. You carried out my purpose for the family of Ahab. Therefore your sons will be kings of Israel to the fourth generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.31'>But Jehu did not take care to keep the law of Jehovah with all his heart. He did not keep himself from the sin that Jeroboam did and made Israel do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.32'>Jehovah began to reduce the size of Israel's territory. King Hazael of Syria conquered all the Israelite territory</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.33'>east of the Jordan, as far south as the town of Aroer on the Arnon River. This included the territories of Gilead and Bashan, where the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and East Manasseh lived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.10.34'>Everything else that Jehu did, including his brave deeds, is recorded in The History of the Kings of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.9'>It was the fourth year of King Hezekiah, the seventh year of Hoshea son of Elah king of Israel. Shalmaneser king of Assyria came up against Samaria and laid siege to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.10'>It was captured at the end of three years. Samaria was taken in the sixth year of Hezekiah's rule, which was the ninth year of Hoshea, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.11'>The king of Assyria took Israel away as prisoners into Assyria. They placed them in Halah and in Habor on the river Gozan, and in towns of the Medes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.12'>They did not obey the voice of Jehovah their God. In fact they went against his agreement, even against everything ordered by Moses, the servant of Jehovah. They did not listen to or obey Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.13'>Now in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, came up against all the walled towns of Judah and took them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.14'>Hezekiah sent a message to Sennacherib at Lachish: »I have done wrong. Stop your attack and I will pay whatever you demand.« The emperor's answer was that Hezekiah should send him ten tons of silver and one ton of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.15'>Hezekiah sent him all the silver in the Temple and in the palace treasury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.16'>Hezekiah had the gold from the doors of Jehovahs Temple and from the doorposts plated by him. He stripped it off and gave it to the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.17'>The king of Assyria sent his commander-in-chief Tartan, his quartermaster, and his field commander with a large army from Lachish to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem. They stood at the channel for the Upper Pool on the road to the Laundryman's Field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.18'>They sent for the king, and Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, who was over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph, the recorder, came out to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.19'>The Rabshakeh said to them: »Say to Hezekiah: These are the words of the great king, the king of Assyria: »In what are you placing your hope?</verse>

We are used to it. Do not use the Jews' language in the hearing of the people on the wall.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.27'>He replied: »Do you think you and the king are the only ones the king sent me to say these things? No, I am also talking to the people who are sitting on the wall. They will have to eat their excrement and drink their own urine, just as you will.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.28'>The official stood up and shouted in Hebrew: »Listen to what the king of Assyria is telling you!</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.31'>»Do not listen to Hezekiah. The king of Assyria commands you to come out of the city and surrender. Make peace with me and you will be allowed to eat grapes from your own vines and figs from your own trees, and to drink water from your own wells cisterns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.32'>»The king will resettle you in a country much like your own. There are vineyards to give wine and there is grain for making bread there. It is a land of olives, olive oil, and honey. Do what he commands and you will not die. Do not let Hezekiah fool you into thinking Jehovah will rescue you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.18.33'>»Did the gods of other nations save their countries from the king of Assyria?</verse>

        <title>HEZEKIAHS PRAYER</title>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.1'>Hezekiah became ill and was about to die. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz said to him: »This is what Jehovah says: Give final instructions to your household. You will not recover. You will die.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.2'>Hezekiah faced the wall and prayed to Jehovah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.3'>»Jehovah, Please remember how I have walked before you in faithfulness and truth. And consider my whole heart devoted to you. I have done what is good in your eyes.« Hezekiah wept bitterly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.4'>Isaiah had not gone as far as the middle courtyard when Jehovah spoke to him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.5'>»Go back and tell Hezekiah, the leader of my people: This is what Jehovah God of your ancestor David says: »I heard your prayer. I saw your tears. Now I will heal you. The day after tomorrow you will go to Jehovahs Temple.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.7'>Then Isaiah said: »Get a fig cake, and put it on the boil so that the king will get well.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.8'>King Hezekiah said to Isaiah: »What is the sign to prove that Jehovah will heal me and that three days later I will be able to go to the Temple?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.9'>Isaiah replied: »Jehovah will give you a sign to prove that he will keep his promise. Would you prefer to have the shadow on the stairway go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?«</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.11'>Isaiah prayed to Jehovah and Jehovah made the shadow go back ten steps on the stairway set up by King Ahaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.12'>The king of Babylonia, Merodach Baladan son of Baladan heard that King Hezekiah was sick. So he sent him a letter and a present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.20.13'>Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them his wealth. He showed his silver and gold. He also let them look at his spices and perfumes.

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.1'>Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king. He ruled in Jerusalem for fifty-five years. His mother's name was Hephzibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.2'>He did evil in the eyes of Jehovah. He copied the disgusting ways of those nations Jehovah sent out before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.3'>He built the high places that Hezekiah his father destroyed. He made altars for Baal. Then he made an Asherah as Ahab, king of Israel, had done. Manasseh was a worshipper and servant of all the stars of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.4'>He built heathen altars in the Temple of Jehovah. The same Temple that Jehovah spoke of when he said: »In Jerusalem will I put my name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.5'>And he built altars for all the stars of heaven in the two outer courts of the Temple of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.6'>He made his own son pass through fire. He burned him as an offering to Molech. He practiced reading the future; gave positions to those who had control of spirits and to wonder-workers. He did much evil in the eyes of Jehovah and provoked him to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.7'>He made an image of the goddess Asherah and set it in the Temple of Jehovah. This is the same Temple that Jehovah said to David and to Solomon his son: »In this house, and in Jerusalem, the town which I have made mine out of all the tribes of Israel, I will put my name forever for a very long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.8'>»And never again will I send the feet of Israel wandering from the land that I gave to their fathers. If only they will take care to do all my orders, and obey all the law my servant Moses gave them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.9'>But they would not listen. Manasseh enticed them to do evil. In fact they committed more evil than the nations whom Jehovah destroyed before the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.10'>Jehovah said through his servants the prophets:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.11'>»Manasseh king of Judah committed detestable sins. He did more evil than all the Amorites before him. He enticed Judah to do evil with his false gods.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.18'>So Manasseh went to rest with his fathers. He was buried in the garden of his house, in the garden of Uzza. Amon his son became king in his place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.21.24'>But the people of the land put to death all those who had taken part in the design against the king. Then they made Josiah his son king in his place.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.3'>Now in the eighteenth year after he became king, Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah son of Meshullam the scribe, to the Temple of Jehovah. He said to him:</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.8'>The chief priest Hilkiah told the scribe Shaphan: »I found the Book of the Law in Jehovahs House.« Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, who then read it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.9'>The scribe Shaphan reported to the king: »We have taken the money donated in the temple and have given it to the workmen who are in charge of Jehovahs House.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.10'>Then the scribe Shaphan told the king: The priest Hilkiah has given me a book. Shaphan read it to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.11'>When the king heard what the book of the Law said, he tore his clothes in distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.12'>The king gave an order to the priest Hilkiah, to Ahikam son of Shaphan, Achbor son of Micaiah, the scribe Shaphan, and the royal official Asaiah. He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.13'>»Go inquire of Jehovah on my behalf and for the people. This is concerning the words in this book that has been found. Jehovahs fierce anger is directed towards us because our ancestors did not obey the things in this book or do everything written in it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.22.14'>So the priest Hilkiah, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to talk to the prophet Huldah. She was the wife of Shallum, son of Tikvah and grandson of Harhas.

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.1'>Then the king sent for all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem to join him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.2'>The king went up to the Temple of Jehovah. All the inhabitants of Judah young and old also went to Jehovahs Temple. Josiah read everything written in the Book of the Promise found in Jehovahs Temple so they could all hear it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.3'>The king stood beside the pillar and made a promise to Jehovah that he would follow Jehovah and obey his commands, instructions, and laws with all his heart and mind.

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.4'>Then the king ordered the high priest Hilkiah, the priests who served under Hilkiah, and the doorkeepers to remove from Jehovahs Temple all utensils that had been made for Baal, Asherah, and the entire army of heaven. Josiah burned the utensils outside Jerusalem. It was in an open field near the Kidron Brook. Then he carried their ashes to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.5'>He got rid of the pagan priests. The kings of Judah appointed them to sacrifice at the illegal places of worship in the cities of Judah and all around Jerusalem. They had been sacrificing to Baal, the sun god, the moon god, the constellations of the zodiac (Mazzalohth Constellation-Job 38:32), and the entire army of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.6'>He removed the pole dedicated to the goddess Asherah from the temple. He took it to the Kidron Valley outside Jerusalem. There he burned it in the Kidron Valley, ground it to dust, and threw its ashes on the tombs of the common people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.7'>He tore down the houses of the male temple cult prostitutes who were in Jehovahs Temple. This is where women did weaving for Asherah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.9'>The priests of the illegal worship sites had never gone to Jehovahs altar in Jerusalem. Instead, they ate their unleavened bread among the other worshipers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.10'>Josiah also made Topheth in the valley of Ben Hinnom unclean so that people would never again sacrifice their sons or daughters by burning them to the god Molech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.11'>He also removed the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the worship of the sun. He burned the chariots used in this worship.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.13'>The king made the illegal places of worship east of Jerusalem unclean. They were on the southern part of the Hill of Destruction. King Solomon of Israel built them for Astarte the disgusting goddess of the Sidonians. Also made unclean were references to Chemosh the disgusting god of Moab, and Milcom the disgusting god of the Ammonites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.14'>Josiah crushed the sacred stones. He cut down the poles dedicated to Asherah. And he filled their places with human bones.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.16'>Josiah turned and saw the tombs on the hill. He sent men to take the bones out of the tombs and burn them on the altar to make it unclean. This fulfilled the word of Jehovah announced by the man of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.17'>»What is that headstone I see over there?« Josiah asked. The men of the town said: »It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah. The one who foretold all these things you have done to the altar of Bethel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.18'>He said: »Let him be. Do not move his bones.« So they let his bones be with the bones of the prophet who came from Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.19'>Josiah removed all the houses of the high places the kings of Israel built in the towns of Samaria. This provoked Jehovah to anger and he did with them as he had done in Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.20'>He killed all the priests of the high places on the altars. Their bones were burned on the altars. Then the king went back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.21'>The king gave orders to all the people. He said: »Keep the Passover to Jehovah your God, as it says in this book of the law.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.22'>Truly, such a Passover had not been kept in all the days of the judges of Israel or of the kings of Israel or the kings of Judah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.24'>Josiah removed all the spirit mediums, the foretellers, the images, and the false gods, and all the disgusting things seen in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem. That way he could establish the words of the agreement recorded in the book Hilkiah the priest discovered in the Temple of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.25'>Never before had there been a king like him. He turned to Jehovah with all his heart and his entire mind and all his power. As the Law of Moses says: and after him there was no king like him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.26'>Still the heat of Jehovahs anger was not turned back from Judah. This is because of all Manasseh had done in moving him to anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.23.27'>Jehovah said: »I will send Judah away from before my face, as I have sent Israel. I will have nothing more to do with this town. It is Jerusalem my town. And the holy house of which I said: My name will be there.«</verse>
