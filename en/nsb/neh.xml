      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Nehemiah, Jehovah Comforts) (443 B.C.E.)</title>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The history of Nehemiah, the son of Hacaliah. Now it came about, in the month of Chislev, in the twentieth year, when I was in Shushan, the castle,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>Hanani, one of my brothers, came with men from Judah. This was in answer to my request for news about the Jews who had been prisoners and escaped from captivity and about Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>They said to me: »The small band of Jews now living there in the land is in deep trouble and shame. The wall of Jerusalem has been broken down, and its doorways burned with fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>After I heard these words I sat down on the ground and cried for days. I ate no food and offered prayer to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>I said: »O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great God, greatly to be respected, keeping faith and mercy with those who have love for him and are true to his laws:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>»Let your ear now take note and let your eyes be open. Please give ear to the prayer of your servant. At this time, day and night I pray for the children of Israel, your servants. I put before you the sins of the children of Israel that we have done against you: truly, my fathers people and I are sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>»We have done great wrong against you. We have not obeyed the orders, the rules, and the decisions, which you gave to your servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>»Keep in mind, O Jehovah, the order you gave your servant Moses, saying: If you do wrong I will send you wandering among the peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>»If you come back to me and obey my orders, even if you have been forced out and are living in the farthest horizons, I will gather you from there, and bring you to the place I have chosen as a dwelling for my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>»These are your servants and your people, whom you have made yours by your great power and by your strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>»O Jehovah, let your ear take note of the prayer of your servant. Of the prayers of all your servants, who take delight in worshipping your name: give help, O Jehovah, to your servant this day, and let him have mercy in the eyes of this man.« Now I was the king's wine-servant.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>In the month of Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him. I served the wine to the king. Never before had I been sad when the king was present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>The king said to me: »Why is your face sad, seeing that you are not ill? This is nothing but sorrow of heart.« Then I was full of fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>I said to the king: »May the king live a very long time. My face should look sad for the town where my fathers are buried is devastated. It has been destroyed by fire.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>The king asked: »What is your desire?« So I made prayer to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>I said to the king: »If it is the king's will, and if your servant has your approval, send me to Judah, to the town where the bodies of my fathers are buried, so that I may rebuild it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>The queen sat by him when the king said: »How long will your journey take? When will you come back? So the king was pleased to send me, and I gave him a fixed time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Further, I said to the king: »If it is the king's pleasure, let letters be given to me for the rulers across the river so that they may let me go through till I come to Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>»I need a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the king's park, so that he may give me wood to make boards for the doors of the tower of the house, and for the wall of the town, and for the house which is to be mine.« The king gave me this, for the hand of my God was on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I came to the rulers of the lands across the river and gave them the king's letters. Now the king sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard I was coming. They were greatly troubled because a man came to help from the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>I stayed at Jerusalem for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>I got up in the night and took a small band of men with me. I said nothing to any man of what God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem, I had no beast with me but the one on which I was seated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>I went in the dark through the gateway of the valley past the Fountain of the Snake Serpents Well as far as the place where waste material was stored. From there I viewed the broken down walls of Jerusalem and the gateways that were burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the door of the fountain and to the king's pool: but there was no room for my beast to get through.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then in the night I went up by the stream, viewed the wall and then turned back. I went in by the valley gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>The chiefs had no knowledge of where I had been or what I was doing. I had not then said anything to the Jews or to the priests or the great ones or the chiefs or the rest of those who were doing the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then I said to them: »You see what a bad condition we are in. How Jerusalem is a waste. Its gateways burned with fire. Come; let us get to work, building up the wall of Jerusalem, so that we may no longer be put to shame.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>Then I gave them an account of how the hand of my God was on me, helping me. I told them of the king's words he said to me. They said: »Let us get to work on the building.« So they made their hands strong for the good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, hearing of it, made sport of us. They laughed at us and said: »What are you doing? Will you go against the king?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>I answered them: »The God of heaven will be our help; so we, his servants, will go on with our building. But you have no part or right or any name in Jerusalem.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>The high priest Eliashib worked with his brother priest to rebuild the Sheep Gateway. They made it holy and put its doors in position. They sanctified everything as far as the tower of Hammeah including to the tower of Hananel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>The men of Jericho worked along with them. Zaccur, the son of Imri worked there also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.3'>The sons of Hassenaah were the builders of the fish doorway. They put its boards in place and put up its doors, with their locks and rods.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.3.14'>And Malchijah, the son of Rechab, the ruler of the division of Beth-haccherem, made good the repair of the doorway with their locks and rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.15'>And Shallun, the son of Col-hozeh, the ruler of the division of Mizpah, made good the doorway of the fountain, building it up and covering it and putting up its doors, with their locks and rods, with the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king's garden, as far as the steps which go down from the town of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.16'>By his side was working Nehemiah, the son of Azbuk, ruler of half the division of Beth-zur, as far as the place opposite the last resting-places of David's family and as far as the pool that had been made and the house of the men of war.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.3.19'>And by his side was working Ezer, the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, making good another part opposite the way up to the store of arms at the turning of the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.20'>After him Baruch, the son of Zabbai, was hard at work on another part, from the turning of the wall to the door of the house of Eliashib, the chief priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.21'>After him Meremoth, the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz, was working on another part, from the door of the house of Eliashib as far as the end of his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.22'>After him were working the priests, the men of the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.23'>After them came Benjamin and Hasshub, opposite their house. After them Azariah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ananiah, made good the wall by the house where he himself was living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.24'>After him Binnui, the son of Henadad, was working on another part, from the house of Azariah as far as the turning of the wall and the angle.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.3.26'>Now the Nethinim were living in the Ophel, as far as the place facing the water doorway to the east, and the tower that comes out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.27'>After him the Tekoites were making good another part, opposite the great tower that comes out, and up to the wall of the Ophel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.28'>Further on, past the Horse Gate, the priests were at work, every one opposite his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.3.32'>And between the way up to the angle and the Sheep Gate, the gold-workers and the traders made good the wall.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>Now, Sanballat, hearing that we were building the wall, was very angry, and in his wrath made sport of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And in the hearing of his countrymen and the army of Samaria he said: »What are these feeble Jews doing? Will they make themselves strong? Will they make offerings? Will they get the work done in a day? Will they make the stones that have been burned come again out of the dust?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was with him, and he said: Such is their building that if a fox climbs to the top of it, their stonewall will be broken down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Give ear, O our God, for we are ridiculed. Let their words of shame be turned back upon them, and let them be given up to plunder in a land where they are prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>Do not let their wrongdoing be covered or their sin be washed away from before you: for they have made you angry before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we went on building the wall. The entire wall was joined together halfway up. The people were working hard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>When the Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabians and the Ammonites and the Ashdodites, heard that the building of the walls of Jerusalem was going forward and the broken places were being made good, they were very angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>All of them conspired to come and launch an attack on Jerusalem, causing trouble there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>We prayed to God and stationed men on watch against them day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>Judah said: »The strength of the workmen is giving way. There is a lot of rubbish so it is impossible for us to put up the wall.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our adversaries kept saying: »They will not know and they will not see until we come right in among them and put them to death. We will cause the work to cease.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>When the Jews who were living near them came, they said to us ten times: »From all directions they are coming against us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>So in the lowest part of the space at the back of the walls, in the open places, I put the people by families, with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And after looking, I got up and said to the great ones and to the chiefs and to the rest of the people, »Have no fear of them. Keep in mind Jehovah who is great and greatly to be feared. Take up arms for your brothers, your sons, and your daughters, your wives and your houses.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>When our enemies heard that we had knowledge of their designs and that God had made their purpose come to nothing, we all went back to the wall, everyone to his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>From that time, half of my servants were doing their part of the work, and half kept the spears and body-covers and the bows and the metal wardresses. The leaders were in back of the men of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>Those who were building the wall and those who were moving material did their part. Everyone worked with one hand and with his spear in the other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>Every builder was working with his sword at his side. By my side was a man for sounding the warning horn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>I said to the leaders and the rest of the people: »The work is extensive and widely spaced and we are far away from one another on the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>»Wherever you may be when the horn is sounded, come here to us. Our God will fight for us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we went on with the work. Half of them had spears in their hands from the dawn of the morning till the stars were seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>At the same time I said to the people: »Let everyone with his servant come inside Jerusalem for the night. At night they may keep watch for us, and go on working by day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>Not one of us, I or my brothers or my servants or the watchmen who were with me, changed clothes. Everyone went armed to the water.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Then there was a great outcry from the people and their wives against their countrymen the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>Some said: »We with our sons and our daughters are a great number. Let us get grain, so that we may have food for our needs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>There were some who said: »We are giving our fields and our vine-gardens and our houses for debt. Let us get grain because we are in need.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>Yet others said: »We have given up our fields and our vine-gardens to get money for the king's taxes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>»But our flesh is the same as the flesh of our countrymen, and our children as their children. Now we give our sons and daughters into the hands of others, to be their servants. Some of our daughters are servants even now. We have no power to stop this. For other men have our fields and our vine-gardens.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>On hearing their outcry and what they said I was very angry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>After giving it much thought, I made a protest to the chiefs and the rulers, and said to them: »Everyone of you is collecting interest from his brothers.« I organized a big meeting of protest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>I said to them: »We have given whatever we were able to give, to make our brothers the Jews free. They were servants and prisoners of the nations. Would you now give up your brothers for a price? Are they to become our property?« They said nothing. They answered not a word!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>I said: »What you are doing is not good. Is it not necessary for you to walk out of respect for our God, because of the shame the nations put on us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>»Even I and my servants have been collecting interest Usury for the money and the grain we have let them have. So now, let us give this up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>»Give back to them this very day their fields, their vine-gardens, their olive-gardens, and their houses, as well as a hundredth part of the money and the grain and the wine and the oil that you have taken from them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>They said: »We will give them back, and take nothing for them. We will do as you say.« Then I sent for the priests and made them take an oath that they would keep this agreement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Shaking out the folds of my robe, I said: »So, may God send out from his house and his work every man who does not keep this agreement. Even so let him be sent out and made as nothing.« All the people said: »Amen!« They praised Jehovah. The people did as they said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>From the time when I was made ruler of the people in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year till the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes the king, for twelve years, my servants and I have never taken the food that was the right of the ruler.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>Earlier rulers who came before me made the people responsible for their upkeep, and took from them bread and wine at the rate of forty shekels of silver. Even their servants were lords over the people. But I did not do so, out of reverence for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>I kept on with the work of this wall. We got no land for ourselves. All my servants helped with the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>There is more, a hundred and fifty of the Jews and the rulers were guests at my table, in addition to those who came to us from the nations nearby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>The food for one day included: one bull and six fat sheep, as well as fowls; and once in ten days a store of all sorts of wine. All the same, I did not take the food to which the ruler had a right, because the people were crushed under a hard yoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Keep in mind, O my God, for my good, all I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Word was given to Sanballat and Tobiah and to Geshem the Arabian and to the rest of our enemies, that I had done the building of the wall and that there were no more broken places in it though even then I had not put up the gates in the gateways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>Sanballat and Geshem sent to me saying: »Come; let us have a meeting in one of the little towns in the lowland of Ono.« But their purpose was to do me evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>I sent men to them saying: »I am doing a great work, so that it is not possible for me to come. Should the work to be stopped while I go away from it and come to you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>They sent this to me four times. I sent them the same answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then Sanballat sent his servant to me a fifth time with an open letter in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>There was written in it: »It has been heard among the nations what Geshem is saying. / He is saying that you and the Jews are hoping to make yourselves free from the king's authority. That this is why you are building the wall. They say that it is your purpose to be their king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>»And that you have prophets preaching about you in Jerusalem, and saying: There is a king in Judah. Now an account of these things will be sent to the king. So come now, and let us have a discussion.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>I responded to him, saying: »No such things as you say are being done. They are only a fiction you have made up yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>They hoped to put fear in us, saying: »Their hands will become feeble and give up the work so that it may not get done.« But now, O God, make my hands strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>And I went to the house of Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, who was confined in his house. He said: »Let us have a meeting in the house of God, inside the Temple, and let the doors be closed for they will come to kill you. Truly, in the night they will come to kill you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>I replied: »Am I the sort of man to go in flight? What man, in my position, would go into the Temple to keep safe? I will not go in.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>Then it became clear to me that God had not sent him. He spoke prophecy against me. Tobiah and Sanballat paid him money to do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>For this reason they paid him money, in order that I might be overcome by fear and do what he said and do wrong. Then they would have reason to say evil about me and put shame on me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>Keep in mind, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat and what they did, and Noadiah, the woman prophet, and the rest of the prophets whose purpose was to frighten me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>The wall was complete on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul. It took fifty-two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>When our enemies had news of this, all the nations round about us were full of fear and were greatly shamed. They saw that our God had done this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>The leaders of Judah exchanged letters with Tobiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For in Judah there were a number of people who had made an agreement by oath with him. For he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah, the son of Arah and his son Jehohanan had taken as his wife the daughter of Meshullam, the son of Berechiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>They spoke a good deal about the good he had done in my presence, and reported what I said to him. Tobiah sent letters with the purpose of causing me fear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>I made controllers over the storehouses, Shelemiah the priest and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and with them was Hanan, the son of Zaccur the son of Mattaniah. They were taken to be honest men and their business was the distribution of these things to their brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Nehemiahs prayer: »Keep me in mind, O my God, in connection with this, and do not let the good which I have done for the house of my God and its worship go from your memory completely.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days, I saw in Judah some who were crushing grapes on the Sabbath, and harvesting grain and putting it on Asses; as well as wine and grapes and figs and all sorts of goods that they took into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. I gave witness against them on the day when they were marketing food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>There were men of Tyre there. They came with fish and all sorts of goods, trading with the children of Judah and in Jerusalem on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>Then I made protests to the chiefs of Judah, and said to them: »What is this evil you are doing, not keeping the Sabbath day holy?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>»Did not your fathers do the same, and did not our God send all this evil on us and on this town? You are causing more anger to come on Israel by not keeping the Sabbath holy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>When the streets of Jerusalem were getting dark before the Sabbath, I gave orders for the gate to be shut and not to be open again until after the Sabbath. I put some of my servants by the gate so that nothing might be taken in on the Sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the traders in all sorts of goods took their night's rest outside Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Then I gave witness against them and said: »Why are you waiting all night by the wall? If you do so again I will have you taken prisoners.« From that time they did not come again on the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>I gave the Levites orders to make themselves clean and come and keep the gates and make the Sabbath holy. »Keep this in mind to my credit, O my God, and have mercy on me, for great is your mercy.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>I saw the Jews who were married to women of Ashdod and Ammon and Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>Their children were talking half in the language of Ashdod; they had no knowledge of the Jews' language, but made use of the language of the two peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>I took up the cause against them, cursing them and giving blows to some of them and pulling out their hair. I made them take an oath by God, saying: »You are not to give your daughters to their sons or take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>»Was it not in these things that Solomon, king of Israel, did wrong? Among a number of nations there was no king like him. He was dear to his God, and God made him king over all Israel. But even he was made to do evil by strange women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>»Are we then without protest to let you do all this great evil, sinning against our God by taking strange women for your wives?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>One of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib, the chief priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite, so I sent him away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>»Keep them in mind, O my God, because they have put shame on the priests' name and on the agreement of the priests and the Levites.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>I made them clean from all strange people. Regular watches were fixed for the priests and for the Levites, everyone in his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>»And for the wood offering, at fixed times, and for the first fruits. Keep me in mind, O my God, for good.«</verse>
