      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Ezekiel, means God Strengthens) (590 B.C.E.) (Babylon)</title>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>I was living among the exiles by the Chebar River. On the fifth day of the fourth month in the thirtieth year the figurative heaven opened and I saw visions from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>On the fifth day of the month during the fifth year of the exile of King Jehoiakin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>The word of Jehovah spoke to Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi. It was in Babylon by the Chebar River. The power of Jehovah came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>I saw a storm coming from the north. There was an immense cloud with flashing lightning surrounded by a bright light. The center of the lightning looked like glowing metal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>In the center of the cloud I saw what looked like four living creatures. They were shaped like humans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>Each of them had four faces and four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>Their legs were straight. Their feet were like those of calves and they glittered like polished copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>They had human hands under their wings on each of their four sides. All four of them had faces and wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>Their wings touched each other. The creatures went straight ahead and they did not turn as they moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>Their faces looked like this: From the front, each creature had the face of a human. From the right side, each one had the face of a lion. From the left, each one had the face of a bull. And from the back, each one had the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>That is what their faces looked like. Their wings were spread out and pointed upward. Each creature had two wings with which they touched each other. The other two wings covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>Each of the creatures went straight ahead. They went wherever the spirit wanted to go, and they did not turn as they moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>The living creatures looked like burning coals and torches. Fire moved back and forth between the living creatures. The fire was bright and lightning came out of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>The living creatures ran back and forth like lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>As I looked at the living creatures, I saw a wheel on the ground beside each of them, with its four faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>This is how the wheels looked and how they were made: They looked like beryl chrysoliteprecious stones. All four wheels looked the same. They looked like a wheel within a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they moved, they moved in any of the four directions without turning as they moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>The rims of the wheels were large and frightening. They were covered with eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>When the living creatures moved the wheels moved with them. When the living creatures rose from the earth, the wheels also rose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit wanted to go the creatures went. The wheels rose with them, because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When the creatures moved, the wheels moved. When the creatures stood still, the wheels stood still. And when the creatures rose from the earth, the wheels rose with them. This is because the spirit of the living creatures was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>Something like a dome was spread over the heads of the living creatures. It looked like dazzling crystal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>Under the dome, each creature had two wings that were stretched out straight, touching one another. Each creature had two wings that covered its body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>When the creatures moved I heard the sound of their wings. The sound was like the noise of rushing water. It was like the thunder voice of the Almighty. It was like the commotion in an army camp. When the creatures stood still, they lowered their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>A voice came from above the dome over their heads as they stood still with their wings lowered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>Above the dome over their heads was something that looked like a throne made of sapphire. On the throne was a figure that looked like a human.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>Then I saw what he looked like from the waist up. He looked like glowing copper with fire all around it. From the waist down he looked like fire. A bright light surrounded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>The brightness all around him looked like a rainbow in the clouds on a rainy day. It was the likeness of Jehovahs glory. When I saw it I immediately fell down with my face to the ground. I heard someone speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>He said to me: »Son of man, stand up, and I will speak to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>The Spirit entered me when he spoke to me. He stood me on my feet, and I heard him speaking to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>He said: »Son of man, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They are people from a nation that has rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have transgressed against me to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>»I am sending you to these defiant and stubborn children.« Tell them: This is what the Sovereign Lord Jehovah says:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>Whether these rebellious people listen or not, they will realize that a prophet has been among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>»Son of man, do not be afraid of them or the things they say. Do not be afraid, even though thorns and thistles are around you and you live among scorpions. Do not let the things they say frighten you. Do not be terrified in their presence even though they are rebellious people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>»Speak my words to them whether they listen or not, because they are rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>»But you, son of man, listen to what I say. Do not be rebellious like those rebellious people. Open your mouth and eat what I give you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>As I looked, I saw a hand stretched out toward me. In it was a scroll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>He slowly spread the scroll in front of me. There was writing on the front and back. There were funeral songs dirges, songs of mourning and horrible things written on it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>Jehovah said to me: »Son of man, eat what you find. Eat this scroll. Then speak to the people of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>He said: »Son of man, eat this scroll I am giving you, and fill your stomach with it.« So I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>He then said to me: »Son of man, go to the people of Israel and speak my words to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>»I am not sending you to people whose language is hard to understand or difficult to speak. I am sending you to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>»I am not sending you to nations whose language is hard to understand, difficult to speak, or whose words you cannot understand. If I send you to those nations they will certainly listen to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>»But the people of Israel will refuse to listen to you because they refuse to listen to me. All the people of Israel are very stubborn and hardheaded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>»Yet, I will make you as stubborn and as hardheaded as they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>»I will make you as hard as a diamond, harder than flint stone. Do not be afraid of them. Do not be terrified in their presence, even though they are rebellious people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>He also said: »Son of man, take to heart everything I have spoken to you, and listen closely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>»Go to the exiles, to your people. Whether they listen or not, tell them: This is what the Lord Jehovah says.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the Spirit lifted me, and behind me I heard a loud thundering voice say: »Blessed is Jehovahs glory from this place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>I also heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures touching one another and the noise of the wheels beside them as well as a loud rumbling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>The Spirit lifted me and took me away. I went away feeling bitter and angry. The strong power of Jehovah came over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>I went to Tel Abib, to the exiles that lived by the Chebar River. I sat there among them for seven days. I was stunned among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>After seven days Jehovah spoke his word to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>»Son of man, I have made you a watchman over the people of Israel. Listen to what I say, and warn them for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>»When I tell a wicked man that he will surely die, but you do not warn him or speak out so that he can change his wicked way in order to save his life; that wicked man will die because of his sin. I will hold you responsible for his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>»When you warn the wicked man, and he does not turn from his wicked way; he will die because of his sin, but you will save yourself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>»If righteous people turn from living the right way and do wrong, I will make them stumble and they will die. If you do not warn them, they will die because of their sin. The right things they did will not be remembered. I will hold you responsible for their deaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>»If you warn righteous people not to sin, and they do not sin, they will certainly live because they listened to the warning and you will save yourself.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>The power of Jehovah came over me. He said: »Get up, and go to the plain. I will speak to you there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>I got up and went to the plain. Jehovahs glory was standing there like the glory I saw by the Chebar River. So I immediately bowed down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>The Spirit entered me and stood me on my feet. He talked to me. He said: »Go shut yourself in your home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>»People will tie you up with ropes, son of man, so that you cannot go outside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>»I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you cannot talk or criticize them, even though they are rebellious people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>»But when I speak to you, I will open your mouth. You will tell them: This is what the Lord Jehovah says. Some will listen and some will refuse to listen for they are a rebellious people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>»Son of man, take a clay tablet and put it in front of you. Draw the city of Jerusalem on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>»Then lay siege to it. Erect siege works against it. Build a ramp up to it. Set up camps against it and put battering rams around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>»Take an iron pan and place it as an iron wall between you and the city. Then turn your face toward it. It will be under siege, and you shall besiege it. This will be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>»Then lie on your left side and put the sin of the house of Israel upon yourself. You are to bear their sin for the number of days you lie on your side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>»I have assigned you the same number of days as the years of their sin. So for three hundred and ninety days you will bear the sin of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>»After you have finished this lie down again. This time lie on your right side, and bear the sin of the house of Judah. I have assigned you forty days, a day for each year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>»Turn your face toward the siege of Jerusalem and with bared arm prophesy against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>»I will tie you up with ropes so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until you have finished the days of your siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>»Take wheat and barley, beans and lentils, millet and spelt; put them in a storage jar and use them to make bread for yourself. You are to eat it during the three hundred and ninety days you lie on your side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>»Weigh out eight ounces of food for each day and eat it at set times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>»You will also have a limited amount of water to drink, two cups a day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>»You are to build a fire out of dried human excrement, bake bread on the fire, and eat it where everyone can see you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>Jehovah said: »This represents the way the Israelites will have to eat food which the Law forbids when I scatter them to foreign countries.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>But I replied: »No, O Lord Jehovah! I have never defiled myself. From childhood on I have never eaten meat from any animal that died a natural death or was killed by wild animals. I have never eaten any food considered unclean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>So God said: »Very well. I will let you use cow dung instead. You can bake your bread on that.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>And he added: »Mortal man, I am going to cut off the supply of bread for Jerusalem. The people there will be distressed and anxious as they measure out the food they eat and the water they drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>»They will run out of bread and water. They will be in despair. They will waste away because of their sins.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>»As for you, son of man, take a sharp sword. Take and use it as a barber's razor to shave your head and beard. Then take scales for weighing and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>»You should burn one-third of the hair in the fire at the center of the city when the siege is over. Take one third and strike it with the sword all around the city. The remaining one third you shall scatter to the wind. I will unsheathe a sword behind them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>»Take also a few strands of hair from them and bind them in the edges of your robes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>»Take again some of them and throw them into the fire and burn them in the fire. Fire will spread from there to all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>»This is what the Lord Jehovah says: This is Jerusalem. I have set her at the center of the nations with countries all around her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>»She has rebelled against my ordinances more wickedly than the nations and against my statutes more than the lands that surround her. My people have rejected my ordinances and have not walked in my statutes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>»Therefore, Jehovah says: You have more turmoil than the nations that surround you. You have not walked in my statutes, nor observed my ordinances, nor observed the ordinances of the nations that surround you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>»Therefore, the Lord Jehovah says: Behold, I, even I, am against you! I will execute judgments against you in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>»Because of all your abominations, I will do among you what I have not done before, and the like of which I will never do again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>»Fathers will eat their sons among you and sons will eat their fathers. I will execute judgments against you and scatter your entire remnant to every wind.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>»As I live, declares the Lord Jehovah, because you have defiled my sanctuary with all your detestable idols and with all your abominations I will withdraw, and my eye will have no pity and I will not spare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>»One third of your people will die by plague or be consumed by famine! One third will fall by the sword! One third I will scatter to every wind! I will unsheathe a sword behind them war will follow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>»I will unleash my anger. I will use my fury against you, and I will get revenge. When my fury is unleashed against you, you will know that I, Jehovah, spoke to you with all my zeal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>»I will turn you into a wasteland and an object of ridicule among the nations around you and in the presence of everyone who passes by you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>»The nations that are around you will ridicule you and laugh at you. When I punish you because of my anger, fury, and fierce revenge, you will become something ridiculed and something horrible. I, Jehovah, have spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>»When I shoot my destructive arrows of famine at you, I will shoot to kill you. I will bring more and more famine into your land. I will cut off your food supply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>»I will send famine and wild animals against you. They will rob you of your children. I will send plagues, violence, and wars to kill you. I, Jehovah, have spoken!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>Jehovah continued to speak his word to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>»Son of man, look toward the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>»Say this: You mountains of Israel listen to the word of the Lord Jehovah! This is what the Lord Jehovah says to the mountains and hills and to the ravines and valleys: »I am going to attack you with a sword and destroy your worship sites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>»Your altars will be destroyed! Your incense burners will be smashed. I will kill your people in front of your idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>»I will lay the dead bodies of the people of Israel in front of your idols. I will even scatter their bones around your altars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>»Your dwelling places in the cities will be ruined, and the worship sites will be wrecked. Your altars will be ruined and demolished. Your idols will be smashed and completely destroyed. Your incense burners will be cut down. Everything you have done will be wiped out.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>»However, I will let some people live. Some people will escape the battle among the nations and be scattered throughout the countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.9'>»Then those who escape will remember me among the nations where they are taken captive. I was hurt by their adulterous hearts, which turned away from me, and by their eyes, which lusted after idols. They will hate themselves for the evil and disgusting things that they have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>»Then you will know that I am Jehovah and that the disaster I promised was not an empty threat.« </verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>»The Lord Jehovah says: Clap your hands, stomp your feet, and say, How sad! The people of Israel have done evil and disgusting things. So they will die in wars, famines, and plagues.</verse>

They will lie on every high hill, on all the mountaintops, and under every large tree and every leafy oak. These are the places where they made offerings to their disgusting idols.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>The word of Jehovah came to me:</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.8'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.1'>On the fifth day of the sixth month in the sixth year, I was sitting in my home. Judah's older men were sitting in front of me. The power of the Lord Jehovah came over me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.2'>As I looked, I saw something that looked like a human. From the waist down its body looked like fire, and from the waist up its body looked like bright glowing metal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.3'>It stretched out what looked like a hand and grabbed me by the hair on my head. In these visions from God, the Spirit carried me between heaven and earth. He took me in vision to Jerusalem, to the entrance of the north gate of the inner court, where the seat of the idol of jealousy, which provokes to jealousy, was located.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.4'>There I saw the glory of Israel's God as I did in the vision that I saw in the valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.5'>God said to me: »Son of man, look toward the north.« So I looked toward the north. There in the entrance to the north gate beside the altar, I saw the idol that provokes jealousy and stirs up God's anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.6'>He asked me: »Son of man, do you see what the people of Israel are doing? The people of Israel are doing very disgusting things here, things that will force me to go far away from my holy place. But you will see even more disgusting things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.7'>Then he took me to the entrance of the courtyard. As I looked, I saw a hole in the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.8'>He said to me: »Son of man, dig through the wall. So I dug through the wall, and I saw a door.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.9'>He said: »Go in and see the wicked abominations abhorrences that they are committing here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.10'>So I entered and looked, and behold, every form of creeping things and beasts and detestable things. There were all the idols of the house of Israel. They were carved on the wall all around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.11'>Standing in front of them were seventy elders of the house of Israel. Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan stood among them. Each man had his censer in his hand and the fragrance of the cloud of incense was rising.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.12'>Then he said: »Son of man, do you see what the elders of the house of Israel are committing in the dark, each man in the room of his carved images? For they say: Jehovah does not see us! Jehovah has forsaken the land!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.13'>He said: »Yet you will see still greater abominations that they are committing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.14'>Then he brought me to the entrance of the gate of Jehovahs house toward the north; and I saw women sitting there weeping for Tammuz the god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.15'>He said to me: »Do you see this, son of man? Yet you will see still greater abominations than these.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.16'>So he took me to the inner courtyard of the Temple. There near the entrance of the sanctuary, between the altar and the porch, were about twenty-five men. They turned their backs to the sanctuary and were bowing low toward the east, worshiping the rising sun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.17'>Jehovah said to me: »Mortal man, do you see that? These people of Judah are not satisfied with merely doing all the disgusting things you have seen here and with spreading violence throughout the country. No, they must come and do them right here in the Temple and make me even angrier. Look how they insult me in the most offensive way possible by thrusting the shoot to my nose! an obsene reference or jesture to Jehovah</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.8.18'>»They will feel all the force of my anger. I will not spare them or show them any mercy my eye will not feel sorry. They will shout prayers to me as loud as they can. But I will not listen to them«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.9'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.1'>God shouted with a loud voice: »Come here, you men who are going to punish the city. Bring your weapons with you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.2'>Six men came from the direction of the upper gate that faces north. Each had his shattering weapon in his hand. Among them was a certain man clothed in linen with a writing case secretarys inkhorn at his side. They went in and stood beside the copper altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.3'>Then the dazzling light of the presence of the God of Israel rose up from the winged creatures where it had been. It moved to the entrance of the Temple. Jehovah called to the man dressed in linen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.4'>»Go through the whole city of Jerusalem and put a mark signature on the forehead of everyone who is distressed and troubled because of all the disgusting things being done in the city.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.5'>I heard God say to the other men: »Follow him through the city and kill. Spare no one! Have mercy on no one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.6'>»Kill the old men, young men, young women, mothers, and children. But do not touch anyone who has the mark on his forehead. Start here at my Temple.« So they began with the elders who were standing there at the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.7'>He said to them: »Dishonor the Temple! Fill its courtyards with dead people, and then leave.« So they went out and killed the people in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.8'>While they were killing people, I was left alone. So I immediately bowed down. I cried: »Help me O Lord Jehovah. Will you destroy everyone who is left in Israel while you pour out your anger on Jerusalem?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.9'>He answered me: »The wickedness of the nations of Israel and Judah is terrible! The land is filled with murder, and the city is filled with wrongdoing. They think that Jehovah has abandoned the land and that he does not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.10'>»But my eye will not feel sorry I will not have compassion or feel sorry. I will do to them what they have done to others.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.9.11'>Then the person dressed in linen who was carrying the writing case inkhorn reported: »I did everything you commanded.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.10'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.1'>I looked at the dome over the heads of the angels. And I saw something that looked like a throne made of sapphire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.2'>Jehovah said to the person dressed in linen: »Go between the wheels under the angels and fill your hands with burning coals. Then scatter them over the city.« So he went between the wheels as I watched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.3'>The angels cherubs were standing on the south side of the Temple as the person went. A cloud filled the inner courtyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.4'>Jehovahs glory rose from the angels to the entrance of the Temple. The cloud filled the Temple, and the brightness of Jehovahs glory filled the courtyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.5'>The sound of the angels' wings was heard as far as the outer courtyard. It was like the sound of the Almighty God when he speaks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.6'>After Jehovah had commanded the person dressed in linen to take burning coals from between the wheels beside the angels, the person went in and stood beside one of the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.7'>One of the angels reached into the fire that was between the angels and took out some coals. This angel put them in the hands of the person dressed in linen. The person took them and left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.8'>I saw that each creature had what looked like a human hand under each of its wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.9'>Then I looked, and behold, four wheels beside the angels. There was one wheel beside each angel. The appearance of the wheels was like the gleam of a chrysolite stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.10'>All four of them had the same likeness in appearance, as if one wheel was within another wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.11'>When they moved, they went in any of their four directions without turning as they went. They followed in the direction that they faced, without turning as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.12'>Their whole body, their backs, their hands, their wings and the wheels were full of eyes all around. The wheels belonged to all four of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.13'>The wheels were called in my hearing, the whirling wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.14'>Each one had four faces. The first face was the face of a cherub angel, the second face was the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.15'>The angels rose. These were the living creatures that I saw at the Chebar River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.16'>When the angels moved, the wheels moved beside them. When the angels lifted their wings to rise from the ground, the wheels did not leave their side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.17'>When the angels stood still, the wheels stood still. When the angels rose, the wheels rose with them. The spirit of the living creatures was in them the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.18'>Then the glory of Jehovah left the Temple's entrance and stood over the angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.19'>The angels lifted their wings and rose from the ground. I was watching them as they left with the wheels beside them. The angels stood at the door to the east gate of Jehovahs Temple, and the glory of the God of Israel was above them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.20'>These are the living creatures that I saw under the God of Israel at the Chebar River. I realized that they were angels cherubs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.21'>Each had four faces and four wings, and under their wings were what looked like human hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.10.22'>Their faces looked exactly like the faces that I saw by the Chebar River. Each one went straight ahead.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.11'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.1'>The Spirit lifted me and took me to the east gate of Jehovahs Temple. It is the gate that faces east. Twenty-five men were at the entrance of the gate. I saw among them Azzur's son Jaazaniah and Benaiah's son Pelatiah. They were leaders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.11.2'>Jehovah said to me: »Son of man, these are the men who plan evil and give bad advice in this city Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.4'>In front of the side rooms was a walkway. It was seventeen and one half feet wide and one hundred and seventy-five feet long. The doors of these side rooms faced north.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.5'>The side rooms on the third story were narrower than those on the first or second stories of the building because the corridors took space away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.6'>The rooms were in three stories. They did not have pillars like the pillars in the courtyards. That is why the rooms on the third story were set farther back than those on the first and second stories.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.7'>There was a wall that ran parallel to the side rooms and the outer courtyard. It ran alongside the side rooms for eighty-seven and one half feet.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.11'>There was a walkway in front of them. It was like the one that was in front of the side rooms on the north side. These side rooms were as long and as wide as the northern rooms. They had similar exits, dimensions, and doors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.12'>The doors to the south rooms were the same as the doors to the north rooms. There was a doorway at the other end of the walkway that was parallel to the corresponding wall that ran eastward. People entered through that doorway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.13'>The man said: »The northern and southern side rooms that face the open area are holy rooms. These rooms are where the priests who come near Jehovah eat the holiest offerings. Because these rooms are holy, the priests keep the holiest offerings there: the grain offerings, the offerings for sin, and the guilt offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.14'>Once the priests enter the Holy Place, they must not go out of the Holy Place into the outer courtyard until they leave behind the clothes that they wore as they served. These clothes are holy. The priests must put on other clothes. Then they can go into the area that is for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.15'>When the man had finished measuring the inner part of the temple area, he led me out through the east gate. Then he measured all the way around the outer area.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.42.20'>He measured all four sides. There was a wall all around it. The wall was eight hundred and seventy-five feet long and eight hundred and seventy-five feet wide. It separated what was holy from what was unholy.</verse>
