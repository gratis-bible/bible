        <title>(Writer: Daniel) (Hebrew: Da-ni-yel means »My Judge is God« ) (536 B.C.E.) (Babylon)</title>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.1'>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Judah. It was in the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.2'>Jehovah allowed Nebuchadnezzar to capture Jehoiakim king of Judah. Nebuchadnezzar carried part of the vessels of the house of God into the Plain of Shinar in Babylon. He brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.3'>The king ordered Ashpenaz the chief of his officials to bring in some of the Israelites including some of the royal family and nobles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.4'>These were young people who had no defects. They were good looking and intelligent, with knowledge. They showed wisdom, knowledge, and understanding of science. They had ability to serve in the king's court and were taught the language and literature of the Chaldeans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.5'>The king assigned a daily amount of the king's special rich food for them and also the wine that he drank. They were to be educated for three years. At the end of that time they would serve the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.6'>Now among these children of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.7'>The officer in charge gave names to them: To Daniel he gave the name of Belteshazzar. Hananiah was called Shadrach. Mishael was called Meshach and Azariah was named Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.8'>Daniel determined in his heart that he would not defile himself with the king's special food and wine. He requested permission from the officer in charge that he might not defile himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.9'>God caused the officer in charge to show special favor and kindness to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.10'>The officer in charge said to Daniel: »I fear my lord the king. He has appointed your food and your drink. Why should he see your faces worse looking than other young people your age? Would you endanger my head with the king?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.11'>Daniel answered the officer appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.12'>»Test your servants, please, for ten days. Give them vegetables to eat and water to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.13'>»You compare our appearance and the appearance of the young people who eat the kings special food. Then you deal with us according to what you see.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.14'>So he listened to them and allowed them to prove the matter for ten days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.15'>They looked better when the ten days ended! They were fairer in appearance and fatter in flesh than the young people who ate the kings special food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.16'>So the steward took away their special food and wine and gave them vegetables and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.17'>God gave these young people knowledge, understanding, and wisdom of all types of literature and learning. Daniel had understanding and wisdom in all visions and dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.18'>When the appointed time for learning ended the chief officer brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.19'>The king interviewed them and found out that none was found to be like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. Therefore they served the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.20'>The king found them ten times better than all the magicians and enchanters in his entire realm. This was in every matter of wisdom and understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.1.21'>Daniel continued to the first year of king Cyrus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Dan.2'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.1'>It was the second year of his reign. He was troubled and could not sleep. Nebuchadnezzar had dreams and was disturbed by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.2'>The king summoned the magicians, enchanters conjurers, sorcerers, and the Chaldeans and commanded them to tell the king about his dreams. They came in and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.3'>The king said: »I had a dream that troubles me and I want to understand what the dream means.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.4'>The Chaldeans spoke in the Syrian language: »O king, may you live for a very long time. Tell your servants the dream, and we will interpret it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.5'>The king answered: »I have decided. If you do not make the dream known to me and its interpretation you will be cut in pieces, and your houses will be made a dunghill foul smelling pile of rubbish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.6'>»But if you tell me the dream and what it means you will receive gifts and rewards and great honor from me. Therefore tell me the dream and the interpretation of it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.7'>They answered the second time. They said: »Let the king tell his servants the dream. Then we will tell the interpretation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.8'>The king responded: »I am certain that you bargain for time, because you see my command is firm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.9'>»If you do not tell me my dream, the law will apply to you. You are stalling by speaking lies to me until I change my requirements. Tell me the dream, and I will know that you can show me the interpretation of it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.10'>The Chaldeans answered: »There is no man on earth who can do what the king requires. No king, lord, or ruler, has asked such a thing of any magician, or enchanter, or Chaldean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.11'>»It is a rare thing that the king requires. There is no other person who can show it to the king, except the gods, and they do not live with humans.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.12'>This caused the king to be angry. In fact he became furious! He commanded that all the wise men of Babylon be destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.13'>So the decree was delivered. The wise men were to be executed. They searched for Daniel and his companions to execute them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.14'>Daniel sent an answer tempered with counsel and prudence to Arioch the captain of the king's guard, who was ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.15'>He asked Arioch the king's captain: »Why is the decree so urgent from the king?« Then Arioch explained it to Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.16'>Daniel made an appointment with the king so he could show the king the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.17'>Then Daniel went back to his house, and explained everything to Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.18'>that they would request mercies from the God of heaven concerning this secret. And they would request that Daniel and his companions would not perish with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.19'>The secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night. Daniel praised the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.20'>Daniel said: »Praise be the name of God forever and ever, for wisdom and might are his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.21'>»He changes the times and the seasons. He removes kings, and sets up kings; he gives wisdom to the wise, and knowledge to the discerning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.22'>»He reveals the deep and hidden things. He knows what is in the darkness, and the light dwells with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.23'>»I thank you, and praise you, O God of my fathers. You have given me wisdom and might. You have made known to me what we desired from you. For you have made known to us the king's situation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.24'>Therefore Daniel went to Arioch. Arioch was appointed by the king to destroy the wise men of Babylon. Daniel said to him: »Do not destroy the wise men of Babylon. Take me to the king and I will show the king the interpretation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.25'>Arioch quickly brought Daniel before the king and said: »I have found a man of the captive children of Judah who will make the interpretation known to the king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.26'>The king said to Daniel, who was also called Belteshazzar: »Are you able to tell me about my dream and interpret it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.27'>Daniel answered: »Wise men, enchanters, magicians, and soothsayers cannot show the secret the king demanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.28'>»There is a God in heaven that reveals secrets. He made known to king Nebuchadnezzar what will be in days to come. Your dream and visions are these:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.29'>»As for you, O king, your thoughts while you were in bed were about what will happen in the future. He who reveals secrets revealed the future to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.30'>»Concerning me, this secret is not revealed to me to give me more wisdom than anyone else. It is for the purpose that the interpretation may be made known to the king; that you may know the thoughts of your mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.31'>»You, O king, saw a large statue. This statue was in fact very large. It was very bright as it stood before you. Its appearance was awesome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.32'>»The statue had a head of pure gold, chest and arms of silver, its belly and its thighs of brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.33'>»It had legs of iron and its feet were partly of iron, and partly of clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.34'>»You watched while a stone was cut out without hands. It struck the statue upon its feet that were of iron and clay, and broke them in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.35'>»The iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the gold, broke in pieces together. It became like the chaff of the summer threshing-floors. The wind carried them away and no place was found for them. The stone that struck the statue became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.36'>»This was the dream! We will interpret it for the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.37'>»You, O king, are king of kings, to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, and the strength, and the glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.38'>»He gave the children of men, the beasts of the field and the birds of the heavens to your hand. He made you the ruler over them all! You are the head of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.39'>»After you another inferior kingdom will arise and another third kingdom of brass, which will rule over all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.40'>»The fourth kingdom will be strong as iron, since iron breaks in pieces and subdues all things. It is iron that crushes all these. It will break in pieces and crush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.41'>»The feet and toes you saw, part of potters' clay, and part of iron will be a divided kingdom. It will have the strength of iron. However, you saw the iron mixed with clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.42'>»As the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of clay, so the kingdom will be partly strong, and partly broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.43'>»The iron mixed with clay will mingle with the seed of men. But they will not adhere to one another. For iron does not stick to clay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.44'>»In the days of those kings the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed. Its sovereignty will not be entrusted to another people. It will break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it will stand forever!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.45'>»You saw a stone cut out of the mountain without hands. It broke the iron, brass, clay, silver, and the gold to pieces. The great God made known to the king what will happen in the future. The dream is certain, and the interpretation of it is sure.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.46'>King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face and worshipped Daniel. He commanded that they present an offering and burn incense to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.47'>The king spoke to Daniel: »It is true, your God is the God of gods, and the Lord of kings, and a revealer of secrets, seeing you were able to reveal this secret.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.48'>The king made Daniel great! He gave him many great gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon. He was appointed chief administrator over all the wise men of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.2.49'>Daniel requested that the king appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego, over the affairs of the province of Babylon. Daniel sat in the court of the king.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.3'>
        <title>THE BLAZING FURNACE</title>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.1'>Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold. He set it up in the plain of Dura, the province of Babylon. It was ninety feet tall and nine feet wide.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.2'>Then Nebuchadnezzar the king gathered the satraps, deputies, governors, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces. They came to the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.3'>The satraps, deputies, governors, judges, treasurers, counselors, sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces were gathered together at the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up. They stood before the image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.4'>Then the herald proclaimed: »You are commanded to do this, O peoples, nations, and men of every language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.5'>»When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes bagpipe, and all kinds of music, you must fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.6'>»Whoever does not fall down and worship will immediately be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.7'>When all the peoples heard the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, all the peoples, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king set up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.8'>Some Chaldean Astrologers brought accusation against the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.9'>They said to Nebuchadnezzar the king, »O king, may you live for a very long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.10'>»You, O king, made a decree, that every man that hears the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, shall fall down and worship the golden image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.11'>»Whoever does not fall down and worship, will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.12'>»The Jews whom you appointed over the affairs of the province of Babylon: Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego have not listened to you. They do not serve your gods. They do not worship the golden image that you set up.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.13'>Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach, Meshach, and Abed-nego. They brought these men before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.14'>Nebuchadnezzar said to them: »Is it true Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that you do not serve my god, nor worship the golden image that I set up?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.15'>»Now if you are ready at the time you hear the sound of the horn, flute, harp, zither, pipes, and all kinds of music, to fall down and worship the image that I have made, good! But if you do not worship it you will be thrown into the midst of a blazing furnace that same hour. What god will be able to rescue you from my hand?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.16'>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered and said to the king: »O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.17'>»If it is so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the blazing furnace. He will deliver us out of your hand, O king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.18'>»If not you should know O king that we will not serve your gods. We will not worship the golden image that you set up!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.19'>Nebuchadnezzar was furious. The expression on his face changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. He commanded that they heat the furnace seven times more than its required heat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.20'>He commanded the mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to throw them into the blazing furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.21'>Then these men were bound in their coats, caps and their other garments. They were thrown into the midst of the blazing furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.22'>Because of the urgency of the king's commandment and the exceeding hot furnace, the flame of the fire killed the men who delivered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.23'>These three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the blazing furnace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.24'>Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonished. He hurried to speak to his counselors: / »Did we cast three men bound into the midst of the fire?« They answered: »True O king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.25'>He said: »Look, I see four men walking in the midst of the fire. They are not hurt! The appearance of the fourth is like a son of the gods!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.26'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning blazing furnace. He called out: »Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, you servants of the Most High God come here!« Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.27'>The satraps, deputies, governors, and the king's counselors, being gathered together, saw these men. They saw that the fire had no power upon their bodies. Not a single hair on their head was singed. Neither were their clothes changed and they did not smell like fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.28'>Nebuchadnezzar said: »Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel and delivered his servants who trusted in him. They violated the king's command and have yielded their bodies, that they might not serve nor worship any god, except their own God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.29'>»Therefore I decree that the people of any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut into pieces. Their houses shall be made a dunghill. There is no other god that is able to deliver like this.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.3.30'>The king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in the province of Babylon.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.4'>
        <title>KING DREAMS ABOUT TREE</title>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.1'>»Nebuchadnezzar the king, to all the peoples, nations, and languages, that dwell in all the earth: Peace be multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.2'>»It seemed good to me to show the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.3'>»How great are his signs! How mighty are his wonders! His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.4'>»I, Nebuchadnezzar, was at rest in my house, and active in my palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.5'>»I saw a dream that made me afraid. When I saw this vision my thoughts troubled me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.6'>»I made a decree to bring in all the wise men of Babylon that they might explain the dream to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.7'>»The magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and the soothsayers came to me. I told the dream to them. They did not explain the dream to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.8'>»Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, according to the name of my god, finally came to me. He has the spirit of the holy gods. So I told the dream to him saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.9'>»O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and no secret troubles you! Tell me the visions I have seen in my dream. Give me the interpretation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.10'>»Here are the visions of my head: I saw a tree in the midst of the earth. It was very tall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.11'>»The tree grew and became strong. Its height reached to heaven. It could be seen from distant parts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.12'>»The leaves were beautiful and the fruit abundant. In it was food for all. The beasts of the field found shadow under it. The birds of the heavens dwelt in its branches. All flesh was fed by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.13'>»I saw in the visions of my head: Behold, a watcher and a holy one came down from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.14'>»He cried aloud: Chop down the tree, and cut off its branches, shake off its leaves, and scatter its fruit. Let the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from its branches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.15'>»Leave the stump and roots in the earth. Apply to it a band of iron and copper in the tender grass of the field. Let it be wet with the dew of heaven. Let its portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.4.16'>»Let its heart be changed from a man's, and let a beast's heart be given to it. Seven times should pass over it.</verse>

        <title>DANIEL IN THE LIONS DEN</title>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.1'>It pleased Darius to appoint a hundred and twenty governors over the kingdom. They were to be located throughout the whole kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.2'>Three commissioners were placed over them. Daniel was one of the commissioners. These governors were to give account to them so that the king would not suffer loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.3'>Daniel was distinguished above the other commissioners and the governors because an excellent spirit mind was in him. Therefore the king thought to set him over the whole realm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.4'>Then the commissioners and the governors sought to find a charge against Daniel concerning the kingdom. They could find no charge, nor error, nor fault, for he was faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.5'>These men said: »We shall not find any charge against Daniel, unless we find it against him in the Law of his God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.6'>Then these commissioners and governors assembled before the king, and said: »King Darius, may you live for a very long time.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.7'>»All the governors of the kingdom, the deputies and the governors, the counselors consulted together to establish a royal statute. They made a strong decree, that whoever prays to any god or man for thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.8'>»Now, O king, establish the decree by signing the document. That it will not be changed, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be altered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.9'>King Darius signed the document for the decree.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.10'>Daniel knew that the decree was signed. He went into his house. His windows were open in his chamber toward Jerusalem. He kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and prayed, and gave thanks before his God, like he did before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.11'>These men assembled together. They found Daniel making petition and supplication before his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.12'>They approached the king about his decree: »Did you sign a decree stating that every man that shall make petition to any god or man within thirty days, except to you, O king, shall be thrown into the den of lions?« The king answered: »The thing is true, according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which may not be altered.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.13'>Then they said: »Daniel, who is of the children of the captivity of Judah, does not show you respect, O king, nor the decree that you signed. He offers his prayer three times a day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.14'>Then the king, when he heard these words, was very displeased with himself. He was determined that Daniel not be delivered to him; and he labored all day to rescue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.15'>Then these men assembled before the king and said: »Know, O king that it is a law of the Medes and Persians, that no decree or statute that the king establishes may be changed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.16'>Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and threw him into the den of lions. The king spoke to Daniel: »Your God whom you serve will deliver you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.17'>A stone was placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed it with his own signet, and with the signet of his lords; that nothing might be changed concerning Daniel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.18'>The king went to his palace and did not eat. He refused musical entertainment and he could not sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.19'>He arose very early in the morning, and went in haste to the den of lions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.20'>He came near to the den and cried with a lamentable voice to Daniel: »O Daniel, servant of the living God, did the God you serve deliver you from the lion?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.21'>Daniel said to the king: »O king, may you live for a very long time.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.22'>« My God sent his angel, and shut the lions' mouths. They did not hurt me. I was found innocent before him. I have done no wrong before you, O king.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.23'>The king was very happy. He commanded that they take Daniel out of the den. So Daniel was taken out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found on him, because he trusted in his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.24'>The king commanded that the men that accused Daniel and had him thrown into the den of lions be thrown into the den of lions. They cast them into the den of lions, their children, and their wives; and the lions killed them and broke their bones in pieces before they reached the bottom of the den.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.25'>Then king Darius wrote to all the peoples, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth: »Peace is multiplied to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.6.26'>»I make a decree, that in all the dominion of my kingdom men tremble with respect before the God of Daniel. He is the living God, and steadfast forever! His kingdom will not be destroyed. His dominion will be even unto the end.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.7.4'>»The first was like a LION. It had eagle's wings. I watched till the wings were pulled off. It was lifted up from the earth and made to stand upon two feet like a man. A man's heart and mind was given to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.7.5'>»Look, a second beast, like a BEAR. It was raised up on one side. Three ribs were in its mouth between its teeth. They said to it, Arise and devour much flesh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Dan.8'>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.1'>A vision appeared to me, Daniel, in the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar. It appeared after the first vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.2'>I saw in the vision: I was in Shushan the castle palace, which is in the province of Elam by the River Ulai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.3'>A ram with two horns stood next to the river. The two horns were tall, but one was taller than the other, and the taller one came up last.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.4'>I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward. No beasts could stand before him. Neither was there any that could deliver out of his hand. He did what ever he wanted and boasted about himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.5'>As I observed a he-goat came from the west over the face of the whole earth. It did not touch the ground. The goat had a notable horn between his eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.6'>He approached the ram that had the two horns, which I saw standing next to the river. He charged him with the full fury of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.7'>I saw him come close to the ram. He was driven with anger and he struck the ram and broke his two horns. The ram had no power to stand before him. He threw him down to the ground, and trampled upon him. No one could deliver the ram out of his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.8'>The he-goat promoted boasted about himself exceedingly. He was strong. The great horn was broken and instead of it there came up four notable horns toward the four winds of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.9'>A little horn cam out of one of them. The little horn became very great, toward the south, and toward the east, and toward the glorious land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.10'>It grew great, even to the host of heaven. It threw down to the ground some of the host and it trampled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.11'>It magnified itself, even to the prince of the host. It took the continual burnt offering from him and the place of his sanctuary was thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.12'>The host was given over to it together with the continual burnt offering through transgression. It cast down truth to the ground, and whatever it wanted to do and prospered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.13'>Then I heard a holy one speak and another holy one said to it: »How long will the vision be concerning the continual burnt-offering and the transgression that makes desolate to give both the sanctuary and the host to be trampled under foot?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.14'>He said to me: »Two thousand and three hundred evenings and mornings. Then the sanctuary will be cleansed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.15'>After I, even I Daniel, had seen the vision I sought to understand it. Behold, there appeared before me a man standing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Dan.8.18'>He spoke to me while I was in a deep sleep with my face to the ground. He touched me, and set me upright.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Dan.8.19'>He said: I will make you know what will happen in the final time of indignation for the vision is for the appointed time of the end.</verse>
