      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Luke, a physician and faithful companion of the Apostle Paul) (56-58 C.E.) (Caesarea)</title>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Many have attempted to write an orderly narrative about the things that have taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>They received testimony from those who were eyewitnesses from the beginning. Ministers of Gods word delivered it to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>Most excellent Theophilus Greek: Theo philos: friend of God: I have accurately traced the course of all things from the beginning. Now it seems good to me to write this report to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>In this way you will know with certainty the truth that you were taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judea, a priest named Zechariah. He was of the priestly division of Abijah. He had a wife of the daughters of Aaron. Her name was Elizabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>They were both righteous before God. They blamelessly obeyed all the commandments and ordinances of God Greek: kurios: God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>They had no child for Elizabeth was barren and they both were well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>He faithfully executed the priests duties before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>The custom was to draw lots to see who served in the temple. It was his turn to enter into the temple of God and burn incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>The whole crowd of people prayed outside at the hour of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>Gods angel appeared to him when he was standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>Zechariah was troubled. When he saw the angel he was filled with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>»Have no fear Zechariah,« said the angel, »for God has heard your prayer. Your wife Elisabeth will have a son and his name will be John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>»You will be filled with joy, and many will be happy at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>»He will be great in the eyes of God. He will not drink wine or strong drink and he will be full of Holy Spirit from the time of his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>»Great numbers of the children of Israel will return to Jehovah their God because of him. (1 Samuel 7:3)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>»He will go before God in the spirit and power of Elijah. He will turn the hearts of fathers to their children and wrongdoers to the way of righteousness. This will make ready a people whose hearts have been directed to Jehovah.« (Malachi 3:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>Zechariah asked: »How might I be certain of this for my wife and I are old?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>The angel answered: »I am Gabriel, whose place is before God. I have been sent to give you this good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>»You will be without voice or language till the day when these things happen. Your lack of faith in what I say has caused this.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>The people were waiting for Zechariah. They were surprised he was in the Temple for such a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>When he came out he could not speak to them. They realized he saw a vision in the temple. Instead of talking he made signs to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>When the days of his priestly service ended he went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>His wife Elisabeth became pregnant. She remained in seclusion for five months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>She said: »This is the way God has dealt with me by taking away my reproach among men.« (1 Samuel 1:11)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>The next month God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth in Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>to a virgin named Mary. Mary was engaged to Joseph, a descendant of King David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>Gabriel appeared to her and said: »Greetings highly favored one. God is with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>She was greatly troubled by this and wondered about the meaning of this salutation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>The angel said to Mary: »Do not fear for you have found favor with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>»You will conceive in your womb and give birth to a son. You will call his name Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>»He will be great. He will be called the Son of the Most High. Jehovah God will give him the throne of his father David. (Isaiah 11:1-10)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>»He will reign over the house of Jacob forever. His kingdom will not end.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Mary asked the angel: »How is this to be for I have had no intercourse with a man?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>The angel replied: »Holy Spirit would come to you and the power of the Most High will envelope you. Because of this the newborn will be called the Son of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>»Your relative Elisabeth has also conceived a son even in her old age. This so-called barren woman is in her sixth month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>»When God speaks, these things are possible.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>Mary said: »Look, Jehovahs servant. Let it happen to me as you spoke.« The angel departed from her. (1 Samuel 1:11)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>Mary traveled with haste to the city of Judah in the hill country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>She entered the home of Zechariah and greeted Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>When Elisabeth heard the greeting from Mary, the babe leaped in her womb. Elisabeth was filled with Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>She shouted loudly: »Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>»How is it that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>»When I heard your greeting the baby leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>»Blessed is she that believes. That which God spoke will be fulfilled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>Mary said: »My life magnifies Jehovah my God. (1 Samuel 2:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>»My heart and mind rejoice in God my Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>»He has looked on the low position of his servant. All generations from now on will call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>»He that is mighty has done great things to me. Holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>»His mercy is to all generations for all who respect him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>»He shows strength with his arm. He scatters the proud in the thoughts of their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>»He removes rulers from their thrones and exalts the humble.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>»He fills the hungry with good things and sends the rich away empty handed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>»He has helped Israel his servant that he might remember mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>»He spoke to our fathers. To Abraham and his seed forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>Mary stayed with Elisabeth about three months, and returned to her house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now it was time for Elisabeth to give birth. She gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>Her neighbors and her relatives heard that Jehovah magnified his mercy towards her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>On the eighth day they circumcised the child. They planned to call him Zechariah, after the name of the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>His mother spoke up and said: »He shall be called John.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>They all said: »None of your relatives are called by this name.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>They made signs to his father, what he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>He asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, »His name is John.« They were all amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>Immediately his tongue loosed, his mouth opened and he spoke, blessing God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>Everyone nearby was in fear. These accounts spread abroad throughout all the hill country of Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>All that heard them wondered in their heart, saying, »What will this child be? For the hand of Jehovah was with him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>His father Zechariah was filled with Holy Spirit and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>»Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel. He has visited his people and brought them redemption. (Psalm 72:18)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>»He raised up a horn of salvation power of deliverance for us in the house of his servant David</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>»He spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets from ages past.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>»He provided salvation from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>»He shows mercy towards our fathers and remembers his holy covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>»It was the oath he spoke to Abraham our father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>»He gave us deliverance out of the hand of our enemies so we could serve him without fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>»May we serve in holiness and righteousness before him all our days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>»Your child will be called the prophet of the Most High. You will go in advance of Jehovah God to make his ways ready. (Malachi 3:1)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>»To give knowledge of salvation to his people in the remission of their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>»A rising of light will visit us from on high because of the tender mercy of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>»The light will shine on them who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. It will guide our feet into the way of peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>The child grew and became spiritually strong. He lived in the deserts till the time came to show himself to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>In those days a decree went out from Caesar Augustus that a census should be taken of all the inhabited earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>This was the first census made when Quirinius was governor of Syria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>So every one went to his hometown to register.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>Joseph came from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea to be counted and taxed. He went to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and family of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>He registered himself with Mary, who was engaged to him. She was about to become a mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>While they were there the time came for Mary to give birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>She gave birth to her firstborn son. She wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger. That was because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>Shepherds in the same country were in the field keeping watch by night over their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>Gods angel stood by them and His glory gave illumination around them and they were very afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>The angel spoke to them: »Do not be afraid. Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy to all the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>»Christ Messiah the Lord, a Savior, is born this day in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>»This is the sign to you: You will find a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes, and lying in a manger.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>Suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly hosts praising God, and saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>»Glory to God in the highest. Peace on earth among men with whom he is pleased.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>The angels went away from them into heaven. Then the shepherds said to one another, »Let us go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which God told us about.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>They hurried to see the baby. They found Mary and Joseph. And they saw the baby lying in the manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>As soon as they saw it they told what they had heard about the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>All that heard it wondered at the things that were spoken to them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>Mary remembered all these sayings, pondering them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>After eight days the baby was circumcised. He was called by the name, Jesus. Jesus: Jehovah is salvation This was the name given by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>Following the days of their purification according to the Law of Moses they brought him up to Jerusalem. There they would present him to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>It is written in Gods law that every male that opens the womb shall be called holy to Jehovah. (Exodus 13:1, 2)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>According to Gods Law they must offer a sacrifice of a pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>There was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for God to save Israel. Gods Holy Spirit was working in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>Holy Spirit revealed to him that he would not die before he saw the Christ of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>Under the power of the spirit he came to the temple. The parents brought in the child Jesus, that they obey the custom of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>He received him into his arms, and blessed God, and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>»Let your servant depart according to your word in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>»My eyes have seen your salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>»That which you prepared before the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>»It is a light of revelation to the nations, and the glory of your people Israel.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>Simeon blessed them and said to Mary his mother: »This child is set for the falling and the rising of many in Israel and for a sign that is spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>»A sword will pierce through your mind that the thoughts of many hearts will be disclosed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>Anna the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher was a very old prophetess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>She had been a widow eighty-four years. She never left the temple. She worshipped and fasted with supplications day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>Even up to that time she gave thanks to God and spoke to all who were looking for the redemption of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>When they had accomplished all things that were according to the law of God they returned to Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>The child grew and became strong. He was filled with wisdom and was blessed by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Every year his parents went to Jerusalem at the feast of the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>When he was twelve years old they went to the feast of the Passover, as was their custom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>When the feast ended they started the return trip. Jesus remained behind in Jerusalem and his parents did not know this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>They thought he was in the traveling company. After a days journey they looked for him among their relatives and friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>When they could not find him they returned to Jerusalem to look for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>After three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers. He was listening and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>All that heard him were amazed at his understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>When they saw him they were astonished. His mother said to him: »Son, why did you treat us this way? Your father and I have searched for you and we have been worried.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>He said: »Why did you look for me? Did you not know that I must be in my Fathers house?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>They did not understand what he said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>He went with them to Nazareth. He remained subject to them. His mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>Jesus grew in wisdom and stature, and in favor with God and men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.31'>Next he traveled to Capernaum, a city of Galilee. There he taught them on the Sabbath day.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.33'>A man in the synagogue had a spirit of an unclean demon. He cried out with a loud voice:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.35'>Jesus rebuked him, saying: »Be quiet and come out of him.« When the demon had thrown him down in front of them, he came out of him without harming him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.36'>All were amazed and spoke to one another. »What is he telling us? For he speaks with authority and with power he commands the unclean spirits and they come out.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.4.38'>He left the synagogue and went to Simons house. Simons mother in law was suffering with a great fever. They asked him to help her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.39'>He stood over her and rebuked the fever. It left her and immediately she rose up and ministered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.40'>When the sun was setting they brought many who were sick of different diseases to him. He laid his hands on every one of them and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.41'>Demons came out from many. They cried out: »You are the Son of God!« He rebuked them and charged them not to speak for they knew he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.42'>The next day he went to a secluded place. The crowds followed him. They did not want him to leave them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.4.43'>He said to them: »I must preach the good news of the kingdom of God to the other cities also. This is why I was sent.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.5'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.1'>Jesus stood by the Lake of Gennesaret as the crowds pressed in upon him in order to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.2'>He saw two boats docked by the shore. The fishermen had gone away from them and were washing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.3'>He boarded one of the boats. It was Simons boat. He asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the crowds from the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.4'>When he finished speaking he asked Simon to put into deep water and let down the nets for a catch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.5'>Simon answered, Master we worked all night and caught nothing. At your word I will let down the nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.6'>When they did this they caught a large number of fish and their nets were breaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.7'>They called their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They filled both boats until they began to sink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.8'>When Simon Peter saw this he fell down at Jesus knees. He said: »Depart from me for I am a sinful man, O Lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.9'>He and all who were with him were amazed at the catch of fish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.10'>So were James and John, the sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon. Jesus said to Simon: »Do not fear. From now on you will catch men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.11'>After they brought their boats to land they left all and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.12'>One time while he was in one of the cities a man full of leprosy fell on his face before Jesus. He said: »Lord, if you want to you can make me clean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.13'>He stretched forth his hand and touched him, saying: »I want to, be made clean.« Immediately the leprosy departed from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.14'>He told him to tell no one and go and show himself to the priest. Then he was to make a cleansing offering, just as Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.15'>The news about him spread far away and large crowds gathered to hear him and to be healed of their infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.16'>He withdrew to a quiet place and prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.17'>One day when he was teaching, Pharisees and doctors of the Law were in the crowd. People came from every village of Galilee, Judea and Jerusalem. Gods power was with him to heal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.18'>Men brought a man on a bed. He was paralyzed. They tried to bring him in and lay him before Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.19'>They could not find a way to bring him in because of the crowd. So they went up to the housetop and let the man and the bed down through the tiles to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.20'>Seeing their faith, Jesus said: »Man your sins are forgiven you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.21'>The scribes and the Pharisees reasoned saying: »Who is this that speaks blasphemies? Who can forgive sins, but God alone?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.22'>Jesus perceived their reasoning and said to them: »Why do you reason in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.23'>»Which is easier to say your sins are forgiven or arise and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.24'>»So you may know that the Son of man has authority on earth to forgive sins,« he said to the man who was paralyzed, »I say to you, arise, take up your bed and go to your house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.25'>Immediately he rose up before them, took his bed and departed to his house, glorifying God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.26'>Everyone was amazed and they glorified God. They were filled with fear. They said: »We have seen strange things today.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.27'>After that he met a tax collector named Levi sitting at his place of business. He told him: »Follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.28'>He gave up everything and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.29'>Levi made him a great feast in his house. There was a large group of tax collectors and of others that were sitting at the meal with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.30'>And the Pharisees and their scribes complained to Jesus disciples. They asked: »Why do you eat and drink with the tax collectors and sinners?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.31'>Jesus answered them: »Those who have good health do not need a physician. The sick do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.32'>»I did not come to call the righteous but sinners to repentance.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.33'>They said: »The disciples of John fast often and make supplications. So do the disciples of the Pharisees. But yours eat and drink.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.34'>Jesus replied: »Could you make the sons of the bride-chamber fast while the bridegroom is with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.35'>»The days will come and when the bridegroom will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.36'>He told an illustration to them: »No one takes a piece of cloth from a new garment and puts it on an old garment. Otherwise he will tear the new. Also the new will not match the old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.37'>»No one puts new wine in old wine skins. The new wine will burst the old skins and spill the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.5.38'>»But new wine must be put into fresh wine skins.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.6.3'>Jesus answered: »Have you not read what David did when he was hungry. He and his companions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.6.4'>entered into the house of God. They and the others with them ate the showbread holy bread. It is only lawful for the priest to eat it.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.10'>When the messengers returned to the house they found the servant in good health.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.11'>After that he, his disciples and a great crowd went to a city called Nain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.12'>When he came near the gate of the city he saw people carrying a dead person. It was the only son of a widow. Many people were with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.13'>When the Lord saw her he had sympathy for her. »Do not cry,« he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.14'>He came near the casket and touched it. The bearers stood still. He said, »Young man arise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.15'>He who was dead sat up and spoke and he was returned to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.16'>They were all afraid and they praised God. They said: »A great prophet has appeared among us. God has visited inspectedselected his people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.17'>News about him went through out all Judea and around the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.18'>The disciples of John told him the news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.19'>John sent two of his disciples to the Lord. They asked, »Should we look for another or are you the one?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.20'>When the men found him they said: »John the Baptist sent us. Are you the one who comes or should we look for another?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.21'>In that hour he cured many diseases, plagues and evil spirits. Sight was restored to the blind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.22'>He answered Johns disciples: »Go and tell John the things you have seen and heard. The blind receive their sight! The lame walk and lepers are cleansed. The deaf hear! The dead are raised up and the poor have good news preached to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.23'>»Blessed is he who is not offended by me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.24'>After Johns disciples departed he told the crowd about John: »What did you go into the wilderness to find? Was it a reed shaken with the wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.25'>»What did you go to see, a man clothed in fancy clothes? Only kings dress in fancy clothes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.29'>When the people heard, they acknowledged Gods justice. They received their baptism from John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.30'>The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God and were not baptized by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.31'>»To whom or what should I compare the men of this generation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.32'>They are like children that sit in the marketplace and call to each other. We played the flute for you but you did not dance. We wailed and you did not weep.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.36'>One of the Pharisees asked him to dine with him. He went to the Pharisees house and sat down to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.37'>A sinful woman went to the Pharisees house. She brought an alabaster vase filled with ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.38'>Standing by his feet weeping, she wet his feet with her tears. She wiped them with the hair of her head. Then she kissed his feet and anointed them with the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.39'>The Pharisee saw it and thought to himself if this man were a prophet he would know what kind of woman touched him. She is a sinner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.7.40'>Jesus said to Simon: »I have something to tell you.« He replied: »What teacher?«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.44'>Turning to the woman, he said to Simon: »See this woman? I entered into your house and you gave me no water for my feet. She watered my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>Jesus and the twelve apostles traveled through cities and villages preaching the good news of the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>Traveling with him were the women who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities. This included Mary Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>Also healed was Joanna the wife of Chuza, Herods steward, and Susanna. There were many others, who supported them out of their private substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>A great crowd came to him from every city. He spoke to them with an illustration:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>»The farmer went out to sow his seed. As he sowed some fell by the side of the road. It was trampled under foot and the birds of heaven devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>»Other seed fell on the rock. As soon as it grew it withered away because it had no moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>»Still other seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>»Other seed fell on the good ground. It grew and produced fruit a hundredfold.« As he said these things he cried. He said: »He who has ears to hear let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>His disciples asked him what this illustration means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>He said: »You are meant to know the secrets of the kingdom of God. I speak to the rest in illustrations, that seeing they may not see and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>»Now the illustration is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>»Those by the side of the road are they who have heard. Then the devil comes and takes the word from their hearts that they may not believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>»Those on the rock are those who receive the word with joy. These have no root. They believe for a while and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>»The seeds that fell among the thorns are people who hear the word and go their own way. They are choked with the cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and do not produce fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>»The good ground represents the honest and good-hearted people. They hear the word, hold fast to it and produce forth fruit with patience.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>»No one lights a lamp and puts a cover over it or hides it under a bed. Instead he places it on a stand that everyone entering may see the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.17'>»Nothing is hidden that will not be revealed. Nothing is secret that will not be made known and come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.18'>»Pay attention and hear! Whoever has will be given more. Whoever does not have, more will be taken away, and even what he thinks he has will be taken.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.19'>His mother and brother tried to come to him but could not because of the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.20'>They told him: »Your mother and your brothers are near. They wish to see you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>He answered, »My mother and my brother are these who hear the word of God, and do it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>He said to his disciples: »Let us go to the other side of the lake.« Then he and his disciples boarded a boat and did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>Jesus fell asleep as they sailed to the other side. A large windstorm came to the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in danger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.24'>They awoke him saying: »Master, Master, we parish!« He rebuked the wind and the raging of the water and there was calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.25'>He asked them, »Were is your faith?« They were afraid and they marveled. They asked: »Who then is this, that he commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.26'>They arrived at the country of the Gerasenes, which is near Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.27'>When he arrived on the shore, a demon-possessed man met him. He wore no clothes and did not live in a house but in the tombs. He had been this way a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.28'>When he saw Jesus he cried out and fell down in front of him. He shouted in a loud voice: »What have I to do with you, Jesus, you Son of the Most High God? I implore you do not torment me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>The spirit seized him many times. For this reason he was kept under guard, and bound with chains and fetters. Breaking the bands apart, he was driven by the demon into the deserts. Jesus commanded the unclean spirit to come out from the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.30'>Jesus asked him: »What is your name?« He answered: »Legion« for many demons had entered into him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.31'>They pleaded with him that he would not command them to depart into the abyss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>There was a herd of many swine feeding on the mountain. They entreated him that he would allow them to enter into them. He gave them permission.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.33'>The demons came out from the man and entered into the swine. The herd rushed down the hill into the lake, and was drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.34'>The herdsmen saw what happened and rushed to the city to tell others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>They went out to see what happened. They came to Jesus and found the man who had been demon possessed. He was clothed, in his right mind and sitting at the feet of Jesus. They were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.36'>They then learned how he was possessed with demons and became whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.37'>The people of the country of the Gerasenes asked Jesus to depart. They were very much afraid. So he boarded a boat and left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.38'>The man who once had demons asked him if he could go with him. Jesus sent him away saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.39'>»Return to your house and declare the great things God has done for you.« He went throughout the whole city telling the great things Jesus had done for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.40'>When Jesus returned the crowd welcomed him. They were all waiting for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue came to Jesus. He fell down at Jesus feet and implored him to come to his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.42'>His twelve-year old daughter was dying. She was his only daughter. As he went the crowds surrounded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.43'>There was a woman having an issue of blood twelve years. She spent all her money on physicians, and could not be healed by any.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.44'>She came behind him and touched the border of his garment. Immediately the issue of blood stopped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.45'>Jesus said: »Who touched me?« Peter and the others with him said: »Master, the people press in from all sides.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.46'>Jesus said: »Someone did touch me. I perceived that power went from me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.47'>When the woman knew she was discovered she trembled, fell down before him and declared in the presence of all the people why she touched him, and how she was healed immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.48'>He said to her: »Daughter, your faith has made you whole; go in peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.49'>While he yet spoke someone came from the ruler of the synagogues house saying: »Your daughter is dead do not trouble the teacher.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.50'>When Jesus heard this he said: »Do not fear, only believe and she will be made whole.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.51'>When he arrived at the house he allowed only the mother and father of the girl, Peter, John and James to enter with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.52'>They were all weeping and morning her. He said: »Do not weep for she is not dead, but sleeps.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.53'>They laughed him to scorn knowing that she was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.54'>He took her hand and called: »Maiden, arise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.55'>Her life force returned and she rose up immediately. He commanded that something be given her to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.56'>Her parents were amazed. He charged them to tell no man what had been done.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.9'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.1'>He called the twelve together and gave them power and authority over all demons, and to cure diseases.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.2'>He sent them out to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.3'>He said, »Take nothing for your journey. Do not take a staff or food or money. Do not even take two coats.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.6'>They departed and went throughout the villages preaching the good news, and healing everywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.7'>Herod the ruler of Galilee heard of all that was done and was very perplexed confusedskeptical. Some said John the Baptist was raised from the dead and that he did it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.8'>Others said that Elijah had appeared and others and that one of the old prophets had risen again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.9'>Herod said: »I beheaded John, but who is this, about whom I hear such things?« He wanted to see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.10'>When the apostles returned they told Jesus about the things they had done. They traveled to the city of Bethsaida.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.11'>The crowds followed him and he welcomed them. He spoke to them about the kingdom of God. He healed many who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.12'>As the day wore on the twelve came to him and said: »Send the people away, that they may go into the villages and country nearby to find lodging and get food, for we are here in a lonely place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.13'>He said to them: »You feed them.« They replied: »We have no more than five loaves and two fishes unless we should go and buy food for all these people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.14'>There were about five thousand men. He said to his disciples, make them sit down in groups of about fifty each.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.15'>They did so, and made them all sit down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.16'>He took the five loaves and the two fishes. Looking up to heaven, he blessed them and broke the bread. Then he gave them to the disciples to pass out to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.17'>They ate and were all filled. Twelve baskets of left over pieces remained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.18'>After he prayed the disciples went to him. He asked them: »Who do the crowds say that I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.19'>They said: »John the Baptist. Others say Elijah and still others say one of the old prophets has risen again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.20'>»But who do you say I am?« He asked. Peter answered him: »The Christ of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.21'>He commanded them to tell this to no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.22'>The Son of man must suffer many things, he told them. The elders, chief priests and scribes will reject him and kill him. The third day he will be raised up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.23'>He told them all: »If any man would come after me let him deny himself. Let him take up his stake of self-denial daily, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.24'>»He who would save his life shall lose it. He who would lose his life for my sake shall save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.25'>»For what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world, and lose or forfeit his own self?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.26'>»If any man is ashamed of my teachings, and of me the Son of man will be ashamed of that person. This will happen when he comes in his own glory, and the glory of the Father, and of the holy angels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.28'>About eight days after he said these things he took Peter, John and James, and went up into the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>While he prayed his appearance changed and his clothes became white and brilliant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>Moses and Elijah talked to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>They appeared in glory and spoke about the death he was about to experience at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>Peter and his companions were very sleepy. When they awoke they saw his brilliance and the two men that stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>Before they left Peter said to Jesus: »Master it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles. We could make one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah.« He did not know what he was saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he said these things a cloud enveloped them and they were filled with fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>A voice came out of the cloud saying: »This is my Son my chosen one. Listen to him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>When the voice came Jesus was found alone. They kept quiet and told no man what they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>After they came down from the mountain a large crowd met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>A man in the crowd cried, »Teacher, please look at my son. He is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>»A spirit controls him and suddenly he cries out. He foams at the mouth. It throws him into convulsions and he is badly bruised.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>Jesus answered: »O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and put up with you? Bring your son to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>When he came near the demon slammed him down and through him in to a convulsion. Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy and gave him back to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>They were all overwhelmed by the greatness of God. Everyone marveled at all the things he did. Jesus said to his disciples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>»Let these words sink into your ears. The Son of man shall be delivered up into the hands of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>They did not understand what he said. The meaning was concealed from them. They could not comprehend it. And they were afraid to ask him about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>They reasoned among themselves which of them was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>When Jesus detected the reasoning of their heart, he took a little child, and set him by his side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>Then he said to them: »Whoever receives this little child in my name receives me. Whoever receives me receives him who sent me. He who is least among you will be the greatest!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>John said: »Master we saw some one casting out demons in your name. So we prevented him from doing this because he does not follow us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>Jesus said: »Do not forbid him for he that is not against you is for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>The days were approaching for his ascension. He was determined to go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>He sent messengers ahead of him. They entered the village of the Samaritans to get ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>They did not receive him because he traveled to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>When his disciples James and John saw this they said: »Lord, do you want us to request fire from heaven to consume them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>He turned and rebuked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>They went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>On the way a man came to him and said: »I will follow you wherever you go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>Jesus told him: »Foxes have holes and birds of heaven have nests, but the Son of man has nowhere to lay his head.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>He told another: »Follow me.« But he said: »Lord first let me go bury my father.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>»Let the dead bury the dead. You go and publish abroad the kingdom of God.« Jesus replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>Another said: »I will follow you Lord, but first let me go say good by to my relatives.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>Jesus responded: »No man, who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God.«</verse>
