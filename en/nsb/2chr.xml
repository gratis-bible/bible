        <title>(Writer: Ezra) (460 B.C.E.)</title>
        <title>KING SOLOMON</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.1'>Solomon, son of David, strengthened his position over the kingdom. Jehovah, his God, was with him and made him very powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.2'>Solomon spoke to all Israel. He spoke to the commanders of regiments and battalions, judges, every prince, and to the heads of Israels families.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.3'>Then Solomon and the entire assembly went to the place of worship in Gibeon because Gods Tent of Meeting was there. Jehovahs servant Moses pitched the tent in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.4'>David already brought Gods Ark from Kiriath Jearim to a place he had prepared for it. He pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.5'>The copper altar that Bezalel, son of Uri and grandson of Hur built was in front of Jehovahs Tent. There Solomon and the assembly worshiped Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.6'>Solomon went to the copper altar in front of the Tent of Meeting and in Jehovahs presence sacrificed one thousand burnt offerings on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.7'>That night God appeared to Solomon. He said: »What do you want me to I give you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.8'>Solomon answered: »You always showed great love for my father David. Now you have allowed me to succeed him as king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.9'>»O Jehovah my God, fulfill the promise you made to my father David. You have made me king over a people, who are so many that they cannot be counted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.10'>»Please give me the wisdom and knowledge I need to rule over them. Otherwise, how would I ever be able to rule this great people of yours?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.11'>God replied to Solomon: »You have made the right choice. Instead of asking for wealth, treasure, fame or the death of your enemies or even for long life for yourself, you have asked for wisdom and knowledge so that you can rule my people, over whom I have made you king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.12'>»For this reason I will give you wisdom and knowledge. And in addition, I will give you more wealth, treasure, and fame than any king has ever had before or will ever have again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.13'>So Solomon left the place of worship at Gibeon, where the Tent of Jehovahs presence was, and returned to Jerusalem. There he ruled over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.14'>Solomon assembled a force of fourteen hundred chariots and twelve thousand cavalry horses. Some of them he kept in Jerusalem. The rest he stationed in various other cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.15'>During his reign silver and gold became as common in Jerusalem as stone, and cedar was as plentiful as ordinary sycamore in the foothills of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.16'>Solomons merchants bought his string of horses and chariots in the regions of Musri and Kue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.1.17'>They imported each chariot from Egypt for fifteen pounds of silver and each horse for six ounces of silver. For the same price they obtained horses to export to all the Hittite and Syrian kings.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.1'>Solomon gave orders to begin building the Temple for Jehovahs name and a royal palace for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.2'>He drafted seventy thousand men to carry heavy loads, eighty thousand to quarry stones in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred foremen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.3'>Solomon sent a message to King Hiram of Tyre: »Do business with me as you did with my father, King David, when you sold him cedar logs for building his palace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.4'>»I am building a Temple to honor Jehovah my God. It will be a holy place where my people and I will worship him by burning incense of fragrant spices. We will present offerings of sacred bread to him continuously, and we will offer burnt offerings every morning and evening, as well as on Sabbaths, New Moon Festivals, and other holy days honoring Jehovah our God. He has commanded Israel to do this from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.5'>»I am determined to build a great Temple. This is because our God is greater than all other gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.6'>»No one can really build a Temple for God. This is because even all the vastness of heaven cannot contain him. How then can I build a Temple that would be anything more than a place to burn incense to God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.7'>»Send me a man with skill in engraving, in working gold, silver, copper, and iron, and in making blue, purple, and red cloth. He will work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem whom my father David selected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.8'>»I know how skillful your lumbermen are, so send me cedar, cypress, and juniper logs from Lebanon. I am ready to send my men to assist yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.9'>»Prepare large quantities of timber, because this Temple I intend to build will be large and magnificent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.10'>»As provisions for your lumbermen, I will send you one hundred thousand bushels of wheat, one hundred thousand bushels of barley, one hundred and ten thousand gallons of wine, and one hundred and ten thousand gallons of olive oil.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.11'>King Hiram sent Solomon a letter in reply. He wrote: »Jehovah made you their king because he loves his people.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.12'>»Praise Jehovah the God of Israel, Creator of heaven and earth! He has given King David a wise son, full of understanding and skill. He now plans to build a Temple for Jehovah and a palace for himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.13'>»I am sending you a wise and skillful master metalworker named Huram Hiram-abi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.14'>»He was the son of a woman from the tribe of Dan. His father is a native of Tyre. Huram knows how to work with gold, silver, copper, iron, stone, wood, purple, violet, and dark red cloth, and linen. He also knows how to make all kinds of engravings and follow any set of plans that will be given to him. He can work with your skilled workmen and the skilled workmen of His Majesty David, your father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.15'>»Your Majesty may now send the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine he promised the workers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.16'>»We will cut all the trees for lumber you need in Lebanon. Then we will make rafts out of it and send them to you in Joppa by sea. You can take it from there to Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.17'>Solomon counted all the men who were foreigners in the land of Israel, as his father David had counted them. Solomon counted one hundred and fifty-three thousand and six hundred foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.2.18'>He directed seventy thousand of them carry heavy loads, eighty thousand of them quarry stone in the mountains, and three thousand six hundred of them supervise the work as foremen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.3'>
        <title>TEMPLE CONSTRUCTION BEGINS</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.1'>Solomon began to build Jehovahs Temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah. That is where Jehovah appeared to his father David. David had prepared the site on the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.2'>He began to build on the second day in the second month of the fourth year of his reign. It was in the place David had povided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.3'>This is how Solomon laid the foundation to build Gods Temple. It was ninety feet long and thirty feet wide. They used the old standard measurement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.4'>The entrance hall in front of the main room was thirty feet wide the same as the width of the temple and thirty feet high. He covered its inside walls with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.5'>He paneled the larger building with cypress. Then he overlaid it with fine gold. It was decorated with designs in the form of palm trees and chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.6'>He covered the building with gems to beautify it and used gold from Parvaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.7'>He also overlaid the building, the rafters, the threshold, the walls, and the doors with gold. He carved cherubim angels on the walls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.8'>He made the most holy place. It was as long as the Temple was wide, thirty feet long. It was also thirty feet wide. He overlaid it with forty-five thousand pounds of fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.9'>The gold nails weighed twenty ounces. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.10'>In the most holy place he made two sculptured cherubim angels and covered them with gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.11'>The combined length of the cherubim wings was thirty feet. A wing of one of the cherub was seven and one half feet long and touched the wall of the building. Its other wing was seven and one half feet long and touched one wing of the other cherub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.12'>The wing of the other one of the cherub angels was seven and one half feet long and touched the other wall of the building. Its other wing was seven and one half feet long and touched the wing of the first cherub. So the cherubs combined wingspan was thirty feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.13'>They stood on their feet facing the main hall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.14'>Solomon made the canopy of violet, purple, and dark red cloth and of linen and decorated it with cherubim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.15'>He made two pillars for the front of the Temple. They were fifty-three feet long, and the crown on each pillar was seven and one half feet high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.16'>He made chains for the inner room and also put them on the crowns. He made one hundred pomegranates and put them on the chains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.3.17'>He set up the pillars in front of the Temple, one on the right and the other on the left. He named the one on the right Jachin He Establishes and the one on the left Boaz In Him Is Strength.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.1'>King Solomon had a copper altar built. It was thirty feet square and fifteen feet high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.2'>He also made a round tank molten sea of copper. It was seven and one half feet deep, fifteen feet in diameter, and forty-five feet in circumference.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.3'>All around the outer edge of the rim of the tank were two rows of decorations, one above the other. The decorations were in the shape of bulls. They had been cast all in one piece with the rest of the tank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.4'>The tank rested on the backs of twelve copper bulls that faced outward. Three faced in each direction, north, west, south and east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.5'>The sides of the tank were three inches thick. Its rim was like the rim of a cup, curving outward like the petals of a flower. The tank held about fifteen thousand gallons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.6'>They also made ten basins, five to be placed on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. They were to be used to rinse the parts of the animals that were burned as sacrifices. The water in the large tank was for the priests to use for washing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.7'>They made ten gold lamp stands according to the usual pattern, and ten tables, and placed them in the main room of the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.8'>He made ten tables and put them in the temple. Five were on the south side and five on the north side. And he made one hundred gold bowls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.9'>He also made the priests courtyard and the large courtyard and its doors. He covered the doors with copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.10'>He set the pool on the south side in the southeast corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.11'>Huram also made the pots, shovels, and bowls. So Huram finished the work for King Solomon in Gods Temple:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.12'>Two pillars, bowl-shaped crowns on top of the two pillars, and two sets of filigree to cover the two bowl-shaped crowns on top of the pillars,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.13'>four hundred pomegranates for the two sets of filigree two rows of pomegranates for each filigree to cover the two bowl-shaped crowns on the pillars,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.14'>ten stands and ten basins on the stands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.15'>one pool and the twelve bulls under it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.16'>pots, shovels, and three-pronged forks. Huram Hiram-abiv made all of them out of polished copper for Jehovahs Temple at King Solomons request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.17'>The king cast them in foundries in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zeredah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.18'>Solomon made so many of these products that no one tried to determine how much the copper weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.19'>Solomon made all the furnishings for Gods Temple: the gold altar, the gold tables on which the bread of the presence was placed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.20'>lamp stands and lamps of pure gold to burn as directed in front of the inner room,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.21'>flowers, lamps, pure gold tongs,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.4.22'>snuffers, basins, dishes, incense burners of pure gold, the gold entrance to the temple, the gold doors of the most holy place, and the gold doors of the Temple.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.5'>
        <title>TEMPLE COMPLETED</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.1'>The work Solomon did on Jehovahs Temple was finished. He brought the holy things that had belonged to his father David, the silver, gold, and all the utensils. He put them in the storerooms of Gods Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.2'>Then Solomon assembled the respected leaders of Israel, all the heads of the tribes, and the leaders of the Israelite families. They came to Jerusalem to take the Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah from the City of David, which is Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.3'>The men of Israel gathered around the king at the Festival of Booths in the seventh month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.4'>When all the leaders of Israel had arrived, the Levites picked up the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.5'>They brought the Ark, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy utensils in it to the Temple. The priests and the Levites carried them</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.6'>while King Solomon and the whole assembly from Israel were offering countless sheep and cattle sacrifices in front of the Ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.7'>The priests brought Jehovahs Ark of the Covenant to its place in the inner room of the Temple, the most holy place, under the wings of the cherubim angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.8'>The cherubim angels outstretched wings were over the place where the Ark rested so that the cherubim became a covering above the Ark and its poles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.9'>The poles were so long that their ends could be seen in the holy place by anyone standing in front of the inner room. However they could not be seen outside. They are still there today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.10'>There was nothing in the Ark except the two tablets Moses placed there at Horeb, where Jehovah made a covenant with the Israelites after they left Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.11'>All the priests who were present had performed the ceremonies to make themselves holy to God without regard to staying in their divisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.12'>All the Levites who were musicians: Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, their sons, and their relatives were dressed in fine linen and stood east of the altar with cymbals, harps, and lyres. With the musicians were one hundred and twenty priests blowing trumpets. When the priests left the holy place,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.13'>the trumpeters and singers praised and thanked Jehovah in unison. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other musical instruments, they sang in praise to Jehovah: »He is good; his mercy lovingkindness endures forever.« Then Jehovahs Temple was filled with a cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.5.14'>The priests could not serve because of the cloud. Jehovahs glory filled the Temple of God.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.6'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.1'>Then Solomon proclaimed: »Jehovah said he would live in a dark cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.2'>»But I have built you a high Temple. It is a home for you to live in permanently.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.3'>Then the king turned around and blessed the entire assembly from Israel while they were standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.4'>»Thanks be to Jehovah God of Israel. With his mouth he made a promise to my father David. With his hand he carried it out.« He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.5'>»Since I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I did not choose any city from the tribes of Israel as a place to build a Temple for my name. And I did not choose any man to be prince over my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.6'>»Now I have chosen Jerusalem to be a place for my name. I have chosen David to rule my people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.7'>»My father David had his heart set on building a Temple for the name of Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.8'>»However, Jehovah said to my father David: Since you had your heart set on building a Temple for my name, your intentions were good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.9'>»You must not build the Temple. Instead, your own son will build the Temple for my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.10'>»Jehovah has kept the promise he made. I have taken my father Davids place. I sit on the throne of Israel as Jehovah promised. I have built the Temple for the name of Jehovah God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.11'>»I put the Ark that contains Jehovahs promise to Israel there.«</verse>
        <title>SOLOMONS DEDICATION PRAYER</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.12'>In the presence of the entire assembly of Israel, Solomon stood in front of Jehovahs altar. He stretched out his hands to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.13'>Solomon had made a copper platform seven and one half feet long, seven and one half feet wide, and four and one half feet high. He put it in the middle of the courtyard. He stood on the platform, knelt in front of the entire assembly, and stretched out his hands toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.14'>He said: »Jehovah God of Israel, there is no god like you in heaven or on earth. You keep your promise of mercy to your servants, who obey you wholeheartedly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.15'>»You have kept your promise to my father David, your servant. With your mouth you promised it. With your hand you carried it out as it is today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.16'>»Now then, O Jehovah, God of Israel, keep your promise to my father David, your servant. You said: You will never fail to have an heir sitting in front of me on the throne of Israel if your descendants are faithful to me as you have been faithful to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.17'>»Therefore, Jehovah, God of Israel, may the promise you made to David, your servant, come true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.18'>»Does God really live on earth with people? If heaven and the highest heaven cannot hold you, then how can this Temple that I have built?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.19'>»Nevertheless, O Jehovah my God, please pay attention to my prayer for mercy. Listen to my cry for help as I pray to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.20'>»Day and night may your eyes be on this Temple, the place where you said your name will be. Listen to me as I pray toward this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.21'>»Hear the plea for mercy that your people Israel and I pray toward this place. Hear us in heaven, the place where you live. Hear and forgive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.22'>»If anyone sins against another person and is required to take an oath and comes to take the oath in front of your altar in this temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.23'>then hear that person in heaven, take action, and make a decision. Repay the guilty person with the proper punishment, but declare the innocent person innocent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.24'>»An enemy may defeat your people Israel because they have sinned against you. But when your people return, praise your name, pray, and plead with you in this Temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.25'>then hear them in heaven, forgive the sins of your people Israel, and bring them back to the land that you gave to them and their ancestors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.26'>»When the sky is shut and there is no rain because they are sinning against you and they pray toward this place, praise your name, and turn away from their sin because you made them suffer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.27'>then hear them in heaven. Forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them the proper way to live. Then send rain on the land, which you gave to your people as an inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.28'>»There may be famine in the land. Plant diseases, heat waves, funguses, locusts, or grasshoppers may destroy crops. Enemies may blockade Israels city gates. During every plague or sickness</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.29'>hear every prayer for mercy made by one person or by all the people in Israel, all who know suffering or pain, who stretch out their hands toward this Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.6.30'>»Hear them in heaven, where you live. Forgive them and give people the proper reply. You know what is in their hearts, because you alone can read hearts.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.1'>When Solomon finished praying, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offerings and the other sacrifices, and Jehovahs glory filled the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.2'>The priests could not go into Jehovahs Temple because Jehovahs glory had filled it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.3'>When all the Israelites saw the fire come down and Jehovahs glory on the Temple, they knelt down with their faces on the pavement. They worshiped and praised Jehovah. They said: »He is good; his mercy lovingkindness endures forever.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.4'>Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.5'>King Solomon offered twenty-two thousand cattle and one hundred and twenty thousand sheep as sacrifices to Jehovah. Thus the king and all the people dedicated Gods Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.6'>The priests were standing at their posts. So were the Levites who had Jehovahs musical instruments that King David made for praising Jehovah. They were saying: »his mercy endures forever.« This he used to offer praise. The priests were opposite the Levites blowing trumpets while all Israel was standing there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.7'>Solomon designated the courtyard in front of Jehovahs Temple as a holy place. He sacrificed the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat because the copper altar that he had made and that was in front of Jehovah was not able to hold all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.8'>Then Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Booths. A very large crowd came from the territory between the border of Hamath and the River of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.7.9'>There was an assembly on the eighth day. They observed the dedication of the altar for seven days and celebrated the festival for another seven days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.1'>It took Solomon twenty years to build Jehovahs house and his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.2'>He rebuilt the cities Huram gave him. He had Israelites live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.3'>Solomon attacked Hamath Zobah and conquered it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.4'>He rebuilt Tadmor in the desert and built all the storage cities in Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.5'>He also rebuilt Upper Beth Horon and Lower Beth Horon into cities fortified with walls, double-door gates, and bars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.6'>He also rebuilt Baalath and all the storage cities that he owned. He built all the cities for his chariots, all the cities for his warhorses, and whatever else he wanted to build in Jerusalem, Lebanon, or the entire territory that he governed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.7'>The Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites had been left in the land because the Israelites had not been able to destroy them. They were not Israelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.8'>They had descendants who were still in the land. Solomon drafted them for slave labor. They are still Israels slaves today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.9'>Solomon did not make any of the Israelites slaves for his projects. Instead, they were the soldiers, officers, generals, and commanders of his chariot and cavalry units.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.10'>These were the officers in charge of King Solomons projects: two hundred and fifty foremen for the people who did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.11'>Then Solomon brought Pharaohs daughter up from the city of David to the house he had built for her. He said: »My wife must not dwell in the house of David king of Israel, because the places are holy where the Ark of Jehovahs Covenant has entered.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.12'>Solomon offered burnt offerings to Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah he had built before the porch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.13'>He did so according to the daily rule, offering them up according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, the new moons and the three annual feasts, the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.14'>As Solomons father David had directed, he set up the divisions of priests for their service and the divisions of Levites for their appointed places. The Levites were to lead in praising Jehovah and to serve beside the priests by doing whatever needed to be done each day. Solomon also set up divisions of doorkeepers at every gate because this was what David, the man of God, had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.15'>No one neglected the kings orders to the priests or the Levites in any matter, including the Temples finances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.16'>All of Solomons work was carried out from the day the foundation of Jehovahs Temple was laid until it was completed. Jehovahs Temple was now complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.17'>Then Solomon went to the coast near Ezion Geber and Elath in Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.8.18'>Huram sent his own servants and his experienced sailors with ships to Solomon. They went with Solomons servants to Ophir. There they procured thirty three thousand seven hundred and fifty pounds of gold, and brought it to King Solomon.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.9'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.1'>The QUEEN OF SHEBA heard about Solomons reputation. So she came to Jerusalem to test him with difficult questions. She arrived with a large group of servants. They had camels carrying spices, a large quantity of gold, and precious stones. When she came to Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.2'>Solomon answered all her questions. No question was too difficult for Solomon to answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.3'>When the queen of Sheba saw Solomons wisdom, the palace he built,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.4'>the food on his table, his officers seating arrangement, the organization of his officials and the uniforms they wore, his cupbearers and their uniforms, and the burnt offerings that he sacrificed at Jehovahs Temple, she was breathless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.5'>She told the king: »What I heard in my country about your words and your wisdom is true!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.6'>»I did not believe the reports until I came and saw it with my own eyes. I was not even told about half of the extent of your wisdom. You have surpassed the stories I heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.7'>»Your men are indeed blessed! Your servants are truly blessed. It is because they are always stationed near you and listen to your wisdom!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.8'>»I thank Jehovah your God, who is pleased with you. He has put you on his throne to be king on behalf of Jehovah your God. Because of your Gods love for the people of Israel, he has established them permanently and made you king over them so that you would maintain justice and righteousness.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.9'>The queen gave the king nine thousand pounds of gold, a very large quantity of spices, and precious stones. Never was there such a large quantity of spices in Israel as those that the queen of Sheba gave King Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.10'>Hurams servants and Solomons servants who brought gold from Ophir also brought sandalwood and precious stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.11'>With the sandalwood the king made gateways to Jehovahs Temple and the royal palace. They also made lyres and harps for the singers. No one had ever seen anything like them in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.12'>King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba anything she wanted. Whatever she asked for, more than what she had brought him. Then she and her servants went back to her country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.13'>The gold that came to Solomon in one year weighed forty nine thousand nine hundred and fifty pounds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.14'>not counting the gold that the merchants and traders brought. All the Arab kings and governors of the land also brought gold and silver to Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.15'>King Solomon made two hundred large shields of hammered gold, using fifteen pounds of gold on each shield.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.16'>He also made three hundred small shields of hammered gold, using seven and one half pounds of gold on each shield. The king put them in the hall named the Forest of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.17'>King Solomon also made a large ivory throne and covered it with pure gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.18'>Six steps led to the throne. It had a gold footstool attached to it. There were armrests on both sides of the seat. Two lions stood beside the armrests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.19'>Twelve lions stood on six steps, one on each side. Nothing like this had been made for any other kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.20'>All King Solomons cups were gold. All the utensils for the hall named the Forest of Lebanon were fine gold. Silver was not considered valuable in Solomons time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.21'>The king had ships going to Tarshish with Hurams sailors. Once every three years the Tarshish ships would bring gold, silver, ivory, apes, and monkeys.</verse>
        <title>SOLOMON RICHEST KING ON EARTH</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.22'>King Solomon was greater in wealth and wisdom than all the other kings of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.23'>All the kings of the world wanted to listen to the wisdom that God gave Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.24'>Everyone who came brought him gifts such as articles of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules. This happened year after year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.25'>Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots, and twelve thousand war horses. He stationed some in chariot cities and others with himself in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.26'>He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River to the country of the Philistines and as far as the Egyptian border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.27'>The king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stones. He made cedars as plentiful as fig trees in the foothills.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.28'>Horses were imported for Solomon from Egypt and from all other countries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.29'>The rest of the acts of Solomon from first to last are written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah from Shiloh, and in Iddo the seers visions about Jeroboam son of Nebat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.30'>Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.9.31'>Solomon lay down in death with his ancestors and was buried in the City of David. His son Rehoboam succeeded him as king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.10'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.1'>Rehoboam went to Shechem because all Israel had gone to Shechem to make him king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.2'>Jeroboam, Nebats son, was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon. When he heard about Rehoboam, he returned from Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.3'>Israel sent for Jeroboam and invited him back. Jeroboam and all Israel went to speak to Rehoboam. They said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.4'>»Your father made us carry a heavy burden. Reduce the hard work and lighten the heavy burden he put on us. We will serve you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.5'>He said to them: »Come back the day after tomorrow.« So the people left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.6'>King Rehoboam sought advice from the elders who had served his father Solomon while he was still alive. He asked: »What do you advise? How should I respond to these people?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.7'>They told him: »If you are good to these people and try to please them by speaking gently to them, then they will always be your servants.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.8'>He ignored the advice the elders gave him. He sought advice from the young men who had grown up with him and were serving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.9'>He asked: »What is your advice? How should we respond to these people who are asking me to lighten the burden my father put on them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.10'>The young men who had grown up with him answered: »This is what you should tell them: My little finger is heavier than my fathers whole body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.11'>»If my father put a heavy burden on you, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will punish you with scorpions.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.12'>So Jeroboam and all the people came back to Rehoboam two days later, as the king had instructed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.13'>The king answered them harshly. He ignored the elders advice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.14'>He spoke to them as the young men advised. He said: »If my father made your burden heavy, I will add to it. If my father punished you with whips, I will use scorpions.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.15'>The king refused to listen to the people because Jehovah was directing these events to carry out the promise he had made to Jeroboam, Nebats son through Ahijah from Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.16'>When all Israel saw that the king refused to listen to them, the people answered the king: »What share do we have in Davids kingdom? We will not receive an inheritance from Jesses son. Everyone to his own tent, Israel! Now look after your own house, David!« So all Israel went home to their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.17'>Rehoboam ruled the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.10.18'>King Rehoboam sent Hadoram to the Israelites. He was in charge of forced labor, but they stoned him to death. So King Rehoboam got on his chariot as fast as he could and fled to Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.4'>Jehovah says: »Do not wage war against your relatives. Everyone, go home. What has happened is my doing.« So they obeyed the word of Jehovah. They turned back from their attack on Jeroboam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.5'>Rehoboam lived in Jerusalem. He built fortified cities in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.6'>He rebuilt Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.12'>He stored shields and spears in each city. He made the cities very secure. Rehoboam held on to Judah and Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.13'>The priests and Levites in every region of Israel aligned with Rehoboam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.14'>The priests abandoned their land and property and went to Judah and Jerusalem because Jeroboam and his descendants rejected them as Jehovahs priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.15'>As an alternative, Jeroboam appointed his own priests for the illegal worship sites and the goat and calf statues he had made as idols.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.11.22'>Rehoboam appointed Abijah, son of Maacah, as family head and prince among his brothers. By doing this, Rehoboam could make him king.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.12.2'>King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem. This took place in the fifth year of Rehoboams reign. It happened because all Israel was not loyal to Jehovah.</verse>

        <title>KING ABIJAH</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.1'>Abijah became king of Judah in Jeroboams eighteenth year as king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.2'>His mother was Micaiah the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. He ruled from Jerusalem for three years when war broke out between Abijah of Judah and Jeroboam of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.3'>Abijah raised an army of four hundred thousand soldiers. Jeroboam opposed him with an army of eight hundred thousand soldiers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.4'>The armies met in the hill country of Ephraim. King Abijah went up Mount Zemaraim and called out to Jeroboam and the Israelites: »Listen to me!« He shouted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.5'>»Do you not know that Jehovah, the God of Israel, made an unbreakable covenant with David, giving him and his descendants kingship over Israel from generation to generation?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.7'>»Later he organized a group of worthless scoundrels. They forced their will on Rehoboam son of Solomon, who was too young and inexperienced to resist them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.8'>»Now you plan to fight against the royal authority Jehovah gave to Davids descendants. You have a huge army! You have with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made to be your gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.9'>»You drove out Jehovahs priests! You evicted the descendants of Aaron and the Levites. In their place you appointed priests in the same way that other nations do. Anybody who comes along with a bull or seven sheep can get himself consecrated as a priest of those so-called gods of yours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.13.10'>»We still serve Jehovah our God! We have not abandoned him. Priests descended from Aaron perform their duties, and Levites assist them.</verse>

They present the offerings of bread on a table that is ritually clean, and every evening they light the lamps on the gold lamp stand. We do what Jehovah has commanded! But you have abandoned him!</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.3'>He got rid of the altars of foreign gods. He broke down the sacred stones. He cut down the poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.5'>He got rid of the illegal places of worship and destroyed the altars for incense in all the cities of Judah. The kingdom was at peace during his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.6'>He built fortified cities in Judah and the land had peace. There was no war during those years because Jehovah gave him a time of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.7'>Asa told Judah: »Let us build these cities and make walls around them with towers and doors that can be barred. The country is still ours because we have dedicated our lives to serve Jehovah our God. We have dedicated our lives to him. He has surrounded us with peace.« So they built the cities, and everything went well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.14.8'>Asa had an army of three hundred thousand Judeans who were armed with large shields and spears and two hundred and eighty thousand Benjaminites who were armed with small shields and bows. All of these men were strong fighting men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.8'>Asa heard the prophet Odeds words of prophecy. He was encouraged and put away the detestable idols from all of Judah, Benjamin, and the cities he had captured in the mountains of Ephraim. He also repaired Jehovahs altar in front of Jehovahs entrance hall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.9'>Then Asa gathered all the people from Judah and Benjamin and the foreigners who had come from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon. Many of them had come to him from Israel when they saw that Asas God, Jehovah, was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.10'>In the third month of the fifteenth year of Asas reign, they gathered in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.11'>They sacrificed to Jehovah a part of the loot they brought with them: seven hundred cattle and seven thousand sheep.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.14'>Asa and the people swore their oath to Jehovah with shouts, singing, and the blowing of trumpets and rams horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.15'>All the people of Judah were overjoyed because of the oath. They took the oath wholeheartedly. They took great pleasure in looking for Jehovah. And he let them find him. So Jehovah surrounded them with rest and peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.16'>King Asa also removed his grandmother Maacah from the position of queen mother. She made a statue of the repulsive goddess Asherah. Asa immediately cut the statue down, crushed it, and burned it in the Kidron Valley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.17'>Although the illegal worship sites in Israel were not taken down, Asa remained committed to Jehovah his entire life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.15.18'>He brought into Gods Temple the silver, the gold, and the utensils he and his father had set apart as holy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.2'>Then Asa brought out all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of Jehovahs Temple and the royal palace. He sent them to Damascus to King Benhadad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.3'>He said: »There is a treaty between you and me as there was between your father and my father. I am sending you silver and gold. Now break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.4'>Benhadad agreed to do what King Asa requested. He sent his generals and their armies to attack the cities of Israel. He conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel Maim, and all the storage cities in the territory of Naphtali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.5'>When King Baasha heard what happened he stopped fortifying Ramah and abandoned the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.6'>King Asa gathered men from throughout Judah and had them carry off the stones and timbers that Baasha had been using at Ramah. They used them to fortify the cities of Geba and Mizpah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.7'>Then the prophet Hanani went to King Asa. He said: »Because you relied on the king of Syria instead of relying on Jehovah your God, the army of the king of Israel has escaped from you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.8'>»The Ethiopians and the Libyans, did they have large armies with many chariots and cavalry troops? But because you relied on Jehovah he gave you victory over them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.10'>Asa was so angry with the prophet that he had him put in chains. It was at this same time that Asa began treating some of the people cruelly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.11'>All the events of Asas reign from beginning to end are recorded in The History of the Kings of Judah and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.12'>In the thirty-ninth year that Asa was king a severe foot disease crippled him. Even then he did not turn to Jehovah for help, but to doctors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.13'>Two years later he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.16.14'>Asa was buried in the rock tomb that he had carved out for himself in Davids City. They used spices and perfumed oils to prepare his body for burial. They built a huge bonfire to mourn his death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.3'>Jehovah blessed Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his fathers early life and did not worship Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.4'>He served his fathers God. He obeyed Gods commandments, and did not act the way the kings of Israel did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.5'>Jehovah gave Jehoshaphat firm control over the kingdom of Judah. The people brought him gifts, so that he became wealthy and highly honored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.6'>His heart was devoted to the ways of Jehovah. He destroyed all the pagan places of worship and the symbols of the goddess Asherah in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.7'>In the third year of his reign he sent out the following officials to teach in the cities of Judah: Benhail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.9'>They taught in Judah. They had the Book of Torah the LawJehovahs Teachings with them when they taught the people in all the cities of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.10'>All the kingdoms around Judah were afraid of Jehovah. As a result, they did not wage war against Jehoshaphat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.11'>Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as taxes. The Arabs also brought him flocks: seven thousand and seven hundred rams and seven thousand and seven hundred male goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.12'>Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful. He built fortresses and cities where supplies were stored in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.17.13'>He stored large supplies of food in the cities of Judah and an army of professional soldiers served him in Jerusalem.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Chr.18'>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.1'>Jehoshaphat was wealthy and honorable. He became Ahabs in-law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.2'>After that he went to visit Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered many sheep and cattle for a banquet in honor of Jehoshaphat and the people who were with him. Ahab persuaded Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth in Gilead with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.3'>He asked: »Will you go with me to attack Ramoth?« Jehoshaphat replied: »I am ready when you are. My army is ready. We will join you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.4'>He added: »But first let us consult Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.5'>Ahab called in about four hundred prophets. He asked them: »Should I go and attack Ramoth, or not?« »Attack it,« they answered. »God will give you victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.6'>Jehoshaphat asked: »Is there another prophet through whom we can consult Jehovah?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.7'>Ahab answered: »There is one more. He is Micaiah son of Imlah. But I hate him because he never prophesies anything good for me. It is always something bad.« Jehoshaphat replied: »You should not say that.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.8'>Consequently King Ahab called in a court official and told him to go and get Micaiah at once.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.9'>The two kings, dressed in their royal robes, sat on their thrones at the threshing place just outside the gate of Samaria. All the prophets were prophesying in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.10'>One of them, Zedekiah son of Chenaanah, made iron horns and said to Ahab: This is what Jehovah says: »With these you will fight the Syrians and totally defeat them.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.11'>All the other prophets said the same thing. »March against Ramoth and you will win,« they said. Jehovah will give you victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.12'>The official who had gone to get Micaiah said to him: All the other prophets have prophesied success for the king. You had better do the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.13'>But Micaiah answered: »By the living God Jehovah I will say what my God tells me to say.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.14'>When he appeared before King Ahab, the king asked him: »Micaiah, should King Jehoshaphat and I go and attack Ramoth, or not?« »Attack!« Micaiah answered. »You will win! Jehovah will give you victory.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.15'>Ahab replied: »When you speak to me in the name of Jehovah, tell the truth! How many times do I have to tell you that?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.16'>Micaiah answered: »I can see the army of Israel scattered over the hills like sheep without a shepherd.« Jehovah said: »These men have no leader. Let them go home in peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.17'>Ahab said to Jehoshaphat: »I told you that he never prophesies anything good for me. It is always something bad!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.18'>Micaiah continued: »Now listen to what Jehovah says! I saw Jehovah sitting on his throne in heaven. All his angels were standing beside him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.19'>Jehovah asked: »Who will deceive Ahab so that he will go and get killed at Ramoth? Some of the angels said one thing, and others said something else,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.20'>until a spirit stepped forward, approached Jehovah,« and said: »I will deceive him.« »How?« Jehovah asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.21'>The spirit replied: »I will go and make all of Ahabs prophets tell lies.« Jehovah said: »Go and deceive him. You will succeed.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.22'>Micaiah concluded: »This is what has happened. Jehovah made these prophets of yours lie to you. But he has decreed that you will meet with disaster!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.23'>Then the prophet Zedekiah went up to Micaiah and slapped his face. He asked: »Since when did Jehovahs spirit leave me and speak to you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.24'>»You will find out when you go into some back room to hide,« Micaiah replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.25'>Then King Ahab ordered one of his officers: »Arrest Micaiah and take him to Amon, the governor of the city, and to Prince Joash.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.26'>Say: »This is what the king says: Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return home safely.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.27'>Micaiah said: »If you really do come back safely, then Jehovah was not speaking through me. Pay attention to this, everyone!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.28'>Thus the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to Ramoth in Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.29'>The king of Israel told Jehoshaphat: »I will disguise myself and go into battle. You, however, should wear your royal robes.« So the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.30'>The king of Aram gave orders to the chariot commanders. He said: »Do not fight anyone except the king of Israel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.31'>When the chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat, they said: »He must be the king of Israel.« So they surrounded him in order to fight him. When Jehoshaphat cried out Jehovah helped him. God drew them away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.32'>Soon the chariot commanders realized that Jehoshaphat was not the king of Israel. Then they turned away from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.33'>One man aimed his bow at random and hit the king of Israel between his scale armor and his breastplate. Ahab told the chariot driver: »Turn around, and get me away from these troops for I am badly wounded.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.18.34'>The battle raged on and King Ahab remained propped up in his chariot, facing the Syrians. At sunset he died.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.1'>Shortly after that the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites came to wage war against Jehoshaphat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.2'>Some men reported to Jehoshaphat: »A large crowd is coming against you from the other side of the Dead Sea, from Edom. The crowd is already in Hazazon Tamar En Gedi.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.3'>Jehoshaphat was frightened and decided to ask for Jehovahs help. He announced a fast throughout Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.4'>The people of Judah gathered to seek Jehovahs help. They came from every city in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.5'>In the new courtyard at Jehovahs Temple, Jehoshaphat stood in front of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.6'>He prayed aloud: »O Jehovah, God of our ancestors, you rule in heaven over all the nations of the world. You are powerful and mighty. No one can oppose you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.7'>»You are our God. When your people Israel moved into this land, you drove out the people who were living here and gave the land to the descendants of Abraham, your friend, to be theirs from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.8'>»Our ancestors lived in this land and built a Temple to honor you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.9'>»They believed that whenever this land is struck by war, judgement, disease, or famine, your people can pray to you at the Temple. You will hear their prayer and save them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.10'>»You can see that the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Edom are attacking us! Those are the nations you would not let our ancestors invade on their way from Egypt. Consequently these nations were not destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.11'>»They are now paying us back by coming to force us out of your land that you gave to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.12'>»You are our God. Will you judge them? We do not have the strength to face this large crowd that is attacking us. We do not know what to do, so we are looking to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.13'>All the people from Judah, their infants, wives, and children were standing in front of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.14'>Then Jehovahs Spirit came to Jahaziel. He was the son of Zechariah, grandson of Benaiah, great-grandson of Jeiel, whose father was Mattaniah, a Levite descended from Asaph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.15'>Jahaziel said: »Pay attention to me, everyone from Judah, everyone living in Jerusalem, and King Jehoshaphat. This is what Jehovah says to you: Do not be frightened or terrified by this large crowd. The battle is not yours. It is Gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.16'>»Attack them tomorrow as they come up the pass at Ziz. Meet them at the end of the valley that leads to the wild country near Jeruel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.18'>»Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low. His face was touching the ground. All the people bowed with him and worshiped Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.19'>»The members of the Levite clans of Kohath and Korah stood up and with a loud shout praised Jehovah, the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.20'>»Early the next morning the people went out to the wild country near Tekoa.

        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.21'>»After consulting with the people, the king ordered some musicians to put on the robes they wore on sacred occasions and to march ahead of the army. They sang: Praise Jehovah! His love is eternal!«</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.25'>Jehoshaphat and his troops came to take the loot. They found among them a lot of goods, clothes, and valuables. They found more than they could carry. They spent three days collecting the loot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.26'>They gathered in the valley of Beracah on the fourth day. Because they thanked Jehovah there, that place is still called the »Valley of Beracah« Thanks today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.27'>All the men of Judah and Jerusalem returned to Jerusalem. They rejoiced while Jehoshaphat led them. Jehovah gave them a reason to rejoice about what had happened to their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.28'>They brought harps, lyres, and trumpets to Jehovahs Temple in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.29'>Deep respect for Jehovah came over the kingdoms in that area when they heard how Jehovah waged war against Israels enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.30'>Jehoshaphats kingdom was peaceful, since his God surrounded him with peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.31'>Jehoshaphat ruled as king of Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he began to rule. He ruled for twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mothers name was Azubah, daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.32'>Jehoshaphat carefully followed the example his father Asa had set and did what Jehovah considered right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.33'>However the illegal worship sites on the hills were not torn down. The people still did not have their hearts set on the God of their ancestors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.34'>Everything else about Jehoshaphat from first to last is written in the records of Jehu, son of Hanani, which is included in the Book of the Kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.35'>After this, King Jehoshaphat of Judah allied himself with King Ahaziah of Israel, who led him to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.36'>Jehoshaphat joined him in making ships to go to Tarshish. They made the ships in Ezion Geber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.20.37'>Eliezer was the son of Dodavahu from Mareshah. He prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said: »Jehovah will destroy your work because you have allied yourself with Ahaziah.« The ships were wrecked and could not go to Tarshish.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.1'>Jehoshaphat died and was buried in the royal tombs in Davids City and his son Jehoram succeeded him as king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.2'>Jehoram son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah had six brothers: Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.3'>Their father gave them large amounts of gold, silver, and other valuable possessions, and placed each one in charge of one of the fortified cities of Judah. But because Jehoram was the oldest, Jehoshaphat made him his successor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.4'>Jehoram was in firm control of the kingdom. He had all his brothers killed, and also some Israelite officials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.5'>Jehoram became king at the age of thirty-two. He ruled in Jerusalem for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.6'>He followed the wicked example of King Ahab and the other kings of Israel. He married one of Ahabs daughters. He sinned against Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.7'>Jehovah was not willing to destroy the dynasty of David. This is because he made a covenant with David and promised that his descendants would always continue to rule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.8'>During Jehorams time Edom rebelled against Judah and chose its own king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.9'>Jehoram took all his chariot commanders to attack. The Edomites and their chariot commanders surrounded him. He got up during the night and broke through their lines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.10'>So Edom rebelled against Judahs rule and is still independent today. At the same time Edom rebelled, Libnah rebelled because Jehoram had abandoned Jehovah the God of his ancestors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.11'>Jehoram made illegal places of worship in the hills of Judah. This caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes. So he led Judah astray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.12'>A letter came to him from the prophet Elijah. It read: This is what Jehovah the God of your ancestor David says: You have not followed the ways of your father Jehoshaphat or the ways of King Asa of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.13'>Instead, you have followed the ways of the kings of Israel. You, like Ahabs family, have caused Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to chase after foreign gods as if they were prostitutes. You have killed your brothers, your fathers family. Your brothers were better than you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.14'>Jehovah will strike a great blow to your people, your sons, your wives, and all your property because you did this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.15'>You will be affected by a painful stomach disease and suffer until you die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.16'>Later Jehovah caused the Philistines and the Arabs who lived near the Ethiopians to become angry with Jehoram.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.17'>They invaded Judah and stole the royal property from the palace. They led Jehorams wives and sons away as prisoners. The only one left behind was Ahaziah, his youngest son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.18'>After this happened; Jehovah struck Jehoram with an incurable stomach disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.19'>Two years later Jehoram died in terrible pain. No bonfire was built to honor him. The people had done this for his ancestors, but not him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.21.20'>Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king. He ruled eight years from Jerusalem. He died, and no one even felt sad. He was buried in Jerusalem, but not in the royal tombs.</verse>

        <title>KING AHAZIAH</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.1'>The people of Jerusalem made Jehorams youngest son Ahaziah king in his place, because the raiders who came to the camp with the Arabs had killed all the older sons. So Jehorams son Ahaziah became king of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.2'>Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he began to rule. He ruled for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, the granddaughter of Omri.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.3'>Ahaziah also followed the ways of Ahabs family, because his mother gave him advice that led him to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.4'>He did what Jehovah considered evil the same as Ahabs family had done. After his father died, they advised him to do what Ahabs family had done. They did this to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.5'>He followed their advice. He joined King Joram of Israel in a war against King Hazael of Syria. The armies clashed at Ramoth in Gilead, and Joram was wounded in battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.6'>He returned to the city of Jezreel to recover from his wounds. Ahaziah went there to visit him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.7'>God used this visit to Joram to bring about Ahaziahs downfall. While Ahaziah was there, a man named Jehu confronted him and Joram. Jehu was the son of Nimshi, whom Jehovah chose to destroy the dynasty of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.8'>Jehu carried out Gods sentence on the dynasty. He came across a group made up of Judean leaders and of Ahaziahs nephews that had accompanied Ahaziah on his visit. Jehu killed them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.9'>A search was made for Ahaziah. He was found hiding in Samaria. They took him to Jehu and put him to death. But they did bury his body out of respect for his grandfather King Jehoshaphat, who had done all he could to serve Jehovah. No member of Ahaziahs family was left who could rule the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.10'>When King Ahaziahs mother Athaliah learned of her sons murder, she gave orders for all the members of the royal family of Judah to be killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.22.11'>Ahaziah had a half sister, Jehosheba, who was married to a priest named Jehoiada. She secretly rescued one of Ahaziahs sons, Joash, took him away from the other princes who were about to be murdered. She hid him and a nurse in a bedroom at the Temple. By keeping him hidden, she saved him from death at the hands of Athaliah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.2'>They went around Judah, gathered the Levites from all the cities of Judah and the leaders of the families of Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.3'>The entire assembly made an agreement with the king in Gods Temple. Then Jehoiada said to them: Here is the kings son. He should be king, as Jehovah said about Davids descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.4'>You must do this: One third of you, the priests and Levites who are on duty on the day of worship, must guard the gates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.5'>Another third must be at the royal palace. And another third must be at Foundation Gate. All the people must be in the courtyards of Jehovahs Temple.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.9'>Jehoiada gave the commanders the spears and the small and large shields. They once belonged to King David but were now in Gods Temple.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.11'>Then they brought out the kings son and put the crown on him. They gave him the testimony and made him king. Jehoiada and his sons anointed him. They said: »Long live the king!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.12'>Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and praising the king. She entered into the house of Jehovah to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.13'>She saw the king was standing by his pillar at the entrance. The captains and the trumpeters were beside the king. All the people of the land rejoiced and blew trumpets. The singers with their musical instruments lead the praise. Then Athaliah tore her clothes and said: »This is treason! Treason!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.14'>Jehoiada did not want Athaliah killed in the Temple area. He called out the army officers and said: »Take her out between the rows of guards. Kill anyone who tries to rescue her.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.18'>Jehoiada put the priests and Levites in charge of the work of the Temple. They were to carry out the duties assigned to them by King David. This included burning the sacrifices offered to Jehovah in accordance with the Law of Moses. They were also in charge of the music and the celebrations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.23.19'>Jehoiada appointed gatekeepers for the gates of Jehovahs temple. That way no one who was unclean for any reason could enter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.9'>Amaziah asked the man of God: »What should I do about the seven thousand and five hundred pounds of silver I gave the troops from Israel?« The man of God answered: »Jehovah can give you much more than that.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.10'>Amaziah dismissed the troops that had come to him from Ephraim. They became furious with Judah and returned home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.11'>Amaziah courageously led his troops. When he came to the Dead Sea region, he killed ten thousand men from Seir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.12'>The Judeans captured another ten thousand alive. They took them to the top of a cliff, and threw them off the top of the cliff so that they were dismembered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.13'>The troops that Amaziah sent back so that they couldnt go with him into battle raided the towns in Judah from Samaria to Beth Horon. They killed three thousand people and took a lot of goods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.14'>After Amaziah came back from defeating the Edomites, he brought the gods of the people of Seir, set them up as his gods, bowed down to them, and burned sacrifices to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.15'>Jehovah became angry with Amaziah. He sent him a prophet who asked: »Why do you dedicate your life to serving the gods of those people? Those gods could not save their own people from you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.16'>The king asked him: »Did we make you an adviser to the king? Stop! Do you want me to have you killed?« The prophet stopped. He said: »I know that God has decided to destroy you because you did this. Yet you refuse to listen to my advice.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.17'>After receiving counsel from his advisers, King Amaziah of Judah sent messengers to King Jehoash, son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu of Israel, to declare war on Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.18'>King Jehoash of Israel sent this message to King Amaziah of Judah: »A thistle in Lebanon sent a message to a cedar in Lebanon. It said: Let your daughter marry my son, but a wild animal from Lebanon came along and trampled the thistle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.19'>»You say you defeated Edom. Now you have become arrogant enough to look for more fame. Stay home! Why must you invite disaster and your own defeat and take Judah with you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.20'>But Amaziah would not listen. God made this happen because he wanted to hand over the Judeans to Jehoash because they had sought help from Edoms gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.21'>Thus King Jehoash of Israel attacked. King Amaziah of Judah met him in battle at Beth Shemesh in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.22'>Israel defeated the army of Judah. The Judeans fled to their homes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.23'>King Jehoash of Israel captured King Amaziah, son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah of Judah, at Beth Shemesh and brought him to Jerusalem. He tore down a six hundred foot section of the wall around Jerusalem from Ephraim Gate to Corner Gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.24'>He took all the gold, silver, and all the utensils he found in Gods temple with Obed Edom and in the royal palace treasury. He also took hostages. Then he returned to Samaria.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.25.27'>Amaziah turned away from Jehovah. So conspirators in Jerusalem plotted against him. Amaziah fled to Lachish, but they sent men to Lachish after him and killed him there.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.3'>Uzziah was sixteen years old when he began to rule. He ruled for fifty-two years in Jerusalem. His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.4'>He did what Jehovah considered right, as his father Amaziah had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.5'>He dedicated his life to serving God in the days of Zechariah. Zechariah taught him to respect God. As long as he dedicated his life to serve God, Jehovah gave him success.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.6'>Uzziah went to wage war against the Philistines. He tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. He built cities near Ashdod and elsewhere among the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.7'>God helped him when he attacked the Philistines, the Arabs who lived in Gur Baal, and the Meunites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.8'>The Ammonites paid taxes to Uzziah. His fame spread to the border of Egypt because he became very powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.9'>Uzziah strengthened the fortifications of Jerusalem. He built towers at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and where the wall turned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.10'>He also built fortified towers in the open country and dug many cisterns, because he had large herds of livestock in the western foothills and plains. Because he loved farming, he encouraged the people to plant vineyards in the hill country and to farm the fertile land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.11'>He had a large army ready for battle. Its records were kept by his secretaries Jeiel and Maaseiah under the supervision of Hananiah, a member of the kings staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.12'>The total number of family heads among these warriors was twenty-six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.13'>They commanded an army of three hundred seven thousand and five hundred soldiers. They were a powerful force that could support the king against the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.14'>Uzziah prepared shields, spears, helmets, armor, bows, and stones for slings for the entire army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.15'>In Jerusalem he manufactured machines designed by inventive people. The machines were placed on the towers and corners to shoot arrows and hurl large stones. Uzziahs fame spread far and wide because he had strong support until he became powerful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.16'>However when he became powerful, his pride destroyed him. He was unfaithful to Jehovah his God. He went into Jehovahs Temple to burn incense on the incense altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.17'>Azariah the priest went in after him with eighty of Jehovahs courageous priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.18'>They opposed King Uzziah. They said to him: »Uzziah, you have no right to burn incense as an offering to Jehovah. That right belongs to the priests, Aarons descendants, who have been given the holy task of burning incense. Get out of the holy place because you have been unfaithful. Jehovah God will not honor you for this.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.19'>Uzziah held an incense burner in his hand. He became angry. As his anger with the priests grew, a skin disease broke out on his forehead. This happened in front of the priests in Jehovahs Temple as Uzziah was at the incense altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.20'>When the chief priest Azariah and all the priests turned toward him, a skin disease was on his forehead. They rushed him away. Uzziah was in a hurry to get out because Jehovah had inflicted him with the disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.26.21'>King Uzziah had a skin disease until the day he died. Since he had a skin disease, he lived in a separate house and was barred from Jehovahs Temple. His son Jotham was in charge of the royal palace and governed the country.</verse>

        <title>KING HEZEKIAH</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.1'>Hezekiah began to rule as king when he was twenty-five years old. He ruled for twenty-nine years in Jerusalem. His mother was Abijah, daughter of Zechariah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.2'>He did right in the eyes of Jehovah, as his ancestor David had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.3'>In the first month of his first year as king, he opened the doors of Jehovahs temple and repaired them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.4'>He assembled the priests and Levites in the square on the east side of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.5'>He said: »Listen to me, Levites. Perform the ceremonies to make the temple of Jehovah the God of your ancestors holy. Remove anything that has been corrupted from the holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.6'>»Our ancestors were unfaithful and did what Jehovah our God considered evil. They deserted him. They turned away from Jehovahs tent and turned their backs on him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.16'>The priests entered Jehovahs temple to make it clean. They carried into the courtyard every unclean thing that they found in Jehovahs Temple. Then the Levites took the unclean items outside the city to the Kidron Brook.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.17'>They started on the first day of the first month. On the eighth day they went into Jehovahs entrance hall. For eight days they performed the ceremonies to make Jehovahs Temple holy. They finished on the sixteenth day of the first month.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.18'>Then they went to King Hezekiah. They said: »We have made Jehovahs entire temple clean. This includes the altar for burnt offerings, all its utensils, the table for the rows of bread and all its utensils,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.20'>Early in the morning Hezekiah assembled the leaders of the city and went to Jehovahs Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.21'>They brought seven bulls, seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats as an offering for sin for the kingdom, the holy place, and Judah. Hezekiah told the priests, Aarons descendants, to sacrifice the animals on Jehovahs altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.22'>So they slaughtered the bulls. The priests sprinkled the blood on the altar. Then they slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar. After that, they slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.23'>Then they brought the male goats for the offering for sin in front of the king and the assembly, who laid their hands on them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.25'>The king followed the instructions Jehovah gave to King David through Gad, the kings prophet, and through the prophet Nathan. He stationed Levites in the Temple, with harps and cymbals,</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.27'>Hezekiah gave the order for the burnt offering to be presented. The offering began and the people sang praise to Jehovah. The musicians began to play the trumpets and all the other instruments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.28'>Everyone there joined in worship. The singing and the rest of the music continued until all the sacrifices were burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.29'>King Hezekiah and all the people knelt down and worshiped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.30'>The king and the leaders of the nation told the Levites to sing to Jehovah the songs of praise that were written by David and by Asaph the prophet. So everyone sang with great joy as they knelt and worshiped God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.31'>Hezekiah said to the people: »Now that you are ritually clean, bring sacrifices as offerings of thanksgiving to Jehovah.« They obeyed, and some of them also voluntarily brought animals to be sacrificed as burnt offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.32'>They brought seventy bulls, one hundred sheep, and two hundred lambs as burnt offerings for Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.33'>They also brought six hundred bulls and three thousand sheep as sacrifices for the people to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.34'>Since there were not enough priests to kill all these animals, the Levites helped them until the work was finished. By then more priests had made themselves ritually clean. The Levites were more faithful in keeping ritually clean than the priests were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.35'>In addition to offering the sacrifices that were burned whole, the priests were responsible for burning the fat that was offered from the sacrifices the people ate, and for pouring out the wine that was presented with the burnt offerings. Thus worship in the Temple began again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.29.36'>King Hezekiah and the people were happy. For God helped them to do all this so quickly.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.15'>They slaughtered the Passover lambs on the fourteenth of the second month. The priests and Levites were ashamed of themselves. They consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the house of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.16'>They stood in their regular places as instructed by the law of Moses. Moses was a man of God. The priests sprinkled the blood they received from the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.17'>Many people in the assembly had not made themselves holy. So the Levites had to kill the Passover lambs for all who were not clean and could not make their lambs holy for Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.18'>Many people from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not made themselves clean. So they ate the Passover, but not in the way the written instructions said they should. Hezekiah prayed for them: »May Jehovah forgive everyone</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.19'>who have their hearts set on dedicating their lives to serve God. May Jehovah the God of their ancestors do this for those who are not clean as required for the holy place.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.20'>Jehovah listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.21'>Thus the Israelites in Jerusalem celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days with great joy. Each day the Levites and priests praised Jehovah in song. They played Jehovahs instruments loudly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.22'>Hezekiah spoke encouraging words to all the Levites who had the skills to serve Jehovah. They ate the festival meals for seven days, sacrificed fellowship offerings, and confessed their sins to Jehovah the God of their ancestors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.23'>Then the whole assembly decided to celebrate the festival for seven more days. So they joyfully celebrated for seven more days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.24'>Hezekiah king of Judah contributed one thousand bulls and seven thousand sheep to the assembly. The princes contributed one thousand bulls and ten thousand sheep to the assembly. A large number of priests consecrated themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.25'>The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced with the priests and the Levites. The entire assembly that came from Israel, both the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and those living in Judah rejoiced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.26'>There was great joy in Jerusalem. Nothing occurred like this in Jerusalem since the days of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.30.27'>The Levitical priests arose and blessed the people. Their voice was heard and their prayer came to Gods holy dwelling place, to heaven.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.1'>When this ended, all Israel who were present went out to the cities of Judah, broke the pillars in pieces, cut down the Asherim and pulled down the high places and the altars throughout all Judah and Benjamin, Ephraim and Manasseh. They destroyed them all. Then all the sons of Israel returned to their cities, each to his possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.2'>Hezekiah assigned the priests and the Levites to divisions. Each priest or Levite was put in a division based on the service he performed. The services included: sacrificing burnt offerings, sacrificing fellowship offerings, serving, giving thanks, or praising within the gates of Jehovahs camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.3'>He set aside part of the kings property for burnt offerings, the morning and evening offerings, burnt offerings on the weekly worship days, the New Moon Festivals, and the annual festivals, as it is written in Jehovahs Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.4'>He told the people living in Jerusalem to give the priests and Levites the portions they were due so that they could devote themselves to Jehovahs Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.5'>As soon as the order was given, the people of Israel brought gifts of their finest grain, wine, olive oil, honey, and other farm produce, and they also brought the tithes of everything they had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.6'>All the people who lived in the cities of Judah brought tithes of their cattle and sheep. They also brought large quantities of gifts they dedicated to Jehovah their God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.8'>King Hezekiah and his officials saw how much had been given. They praised Jehovah and praised his people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.9'>The king spoke to the priests and the Levites about these gifts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.10'>and Azariah the High Priest, a descendant of Zadok, said to him: Since the people started bringing their gifts to the temple, there has been enough to eat and a large surplus besides. We have all this because Jehovah has blessed his people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.11'>On the kings orders they prepared storerooms in the Temple area</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.12'>and put all the gifts and tithes in them for safekeeping. They placed a Levite named Conaniah in charge and made his brother Shimei his assistant.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.14'>Kore son of Imnah, a Levite who was chief guard at the East Gate of the temple, was in charge of receiving the gifts offered to Jehovah and of distributing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.15'>In the other cities where priests lived, he was faithfully assisted in this by other Levites: Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They distributed the food equally to their fellow Levites according to what their duties were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.16'>They were appointed to distribute them to males who were at least three years old. The way they were enrolled in the genealogical records did not matter. The six men who served under Kore were to distribute the offerings to everyone who went to Jehovahs Temple to perform the daily service that each division was responsible for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.17'>They were to distribute offerings to the priests who were enrolled by families and to the Levites who were at least twenty years old. Distribution was based on the way they served in their divisions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.18'>The priests and Levites were enrolled with their wives, sons, daughters, and other people who depended on them in the community. The priests and Levites had to be faithful in keeping themselves holy for the holy work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.19'>Men were appointed to give a portion of the offerings to all the males in the priestly families and to everyone listed in the genealogies of the Levites. These men were Aarons descendants, priests who lived in the pasturelands of every Levite city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.20'>This is what Hezekiah did throughout Judah. He did what was good and right and true to Jehovah his God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.31.21'>Hezekiah incorporated Moses teachings and commands into worship and dedicated his life to serving God. Whatever he did for the worship in Gods Temple, he did wholeheartedly, and he succeeded.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.1'>After everything Hezekiah had done so faithfully, King Sennacherib of Assyria came to invade Judah. He set up camp to attack the fortified cities. He intended to conquer them himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.2'>Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come to wage war against Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.3'>He and his officers and military staff made plans to stop the water from flowing out of the springs outside the city. They helped him do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.4'>A large crowd gathered as they stopped all the springs and the brook that flowed through the land. They said: Why should the kings of Assyria find plenty of water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.5'>Hezekiah worked hard. He rebuilt all the broken sections of the wall. He built the towers taller and built another wall outside the city wall. He strengthened the Millo in the City of David, and made plenty of weapons and shields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.6'>He appointed military commanders over the troops and gathered the commanders in the square by the city gate. He spoke these words of encouragement:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.7'>Be strong and courageous. Do not be frightened or terrified by the king of Assyria or the crowd with him. Someone greater is on our side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.8'>Jehovah our God fights on our side. The Assyrians must rely on human power alone. These words encouraged the army of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.9'>Sennacherib and his troops were camped at the town of Lachish. He sent a message to Hezekiah and the people in Jerusalem. It said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.10'>»I am King Sennacherib of Assyria. I have Jerusalem surrounded. Do you think you can survive my attack?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.11'>»Hezekiah your king is telling you that Jehovah your God will save you from me. But he is lying! You will die of hunger and thirst.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.12'>»Did Hezekiah not tear down all except one of Jehovahs altars and places of worship? And did he not tell you people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship at that one place?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.15'>»Do not be fooled by Hezekiah! No god of any nation has been able to stand up to Assyria. Believe me, your God cannot keep you safe!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.16'>Sennacheribs officers said more against Jehovah God and his servant Hezekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.17'>Sennacherib wrote letters cursing Jehovah the God of Israel. These letters said: The gods of the nations in other countries could not rescue their people from me. Hezekiahs God cannot rescue his people from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.18'>Sennacheribs officers shouted loudly in the Judean language to the troops who were on the wall of Jerusalem. They tried to frighten and terrify the troops so that they could capture the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.19'>They spoke against the God of Jerusalem as if he were one of the gods of the peoples of the earth, the work of the hands of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.20'>King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, prayed about this and called to heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.21'>Jehovah sent an angel who exterminated all the soldiers, officials, and commanders in the Assyrian kings camp. Sennacherib was humiliated and returned to his own country. When he went into the temple of his god, some of his own sons killed him with a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.22'>So Jehovah saved Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem from King Sennacherib of Assyria and from everyone else. Jehovah gave them peace with all their neighbors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.23'>Many people still went to Jerusalem to bring gifts to Jehovah and expensive presents to King Hezekiah of Judah. From that point in history he was considered important by all the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.24'>Hezekiah became sick and was about to die. He prayed to Jehovah, who answered him and gave him a miraculous sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.25'>But Hezekiah was conceited. So he did not repay Jehovah for his kindness. Jehovah became angry with him, with Judah, and with Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.26'>Hezekiah and the people living in Jerusalem humbled themselves when they realized they had become conceited. Thus Jehovah did not vent his anger on them during Hezekiahs time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.27'>Hezekiah became richer and was highly honored. He prepared storehouses for himself to hold silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all kinds of valuables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.28'>He built storehouses for the produce of grain and wine and oil; and buildings for all sorts of beasts and flocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.29'>He made towns for himself. He gathered much property in flocks and herds: for God had given him great wealth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.30'>It was Hezekiah who had the higher spring of the water of Gihon stopped, and the water taken down on the west side of the town of David. Hezekiah did well in everything he tried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.31'>When the leaders of Babylon sent ambassadors to ask him about the miraculous sign that had happened in the land, God left him. God did this to test him, to find out everything that was in Hezekiahs heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.32'>Everything else about Hezekiah, including his devotion to God, is written in the vision of the prophet Isaiah, son of Amoz, and in the records of the kings of Judah and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.32.33'>Hezekiah slept in death with his ancestors. He was buried in the upper tombs of Davids descendants. When Hezekiah died, all of Judah and the people in Jerusalem honored him. His son Manasseh succeeded him as king.</verse>

        <title>KING MANASSEH</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.1'>Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king. He ruled for fifty-five years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.2'>He did what Jehovah considered evil by copying the disgusting things done by the nations that Jehovah dispossessed from before the Israelites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.3'>He rebuilt the illegal places of worship that his father Hezekiah had torn down. He set up altars dedicated to other gods such as the Baals. He erected a pole dedicated to the goddess Asherah as King Ahab of Israel had done. Manasseh, like Ahab, worshiped and served the entire army of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.4'>He built altars in Jehovahs Temple, of which Jehovah said: »My name will be in Jerusalem from generation to generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.5'>He built altars for the entire army of heaven in the two courtyards of Jehovahs Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.6'>He burned his son as a sacrifice in the valley of Ben Hinnom, he consulted fortunetellers, and he cast evil spells. He also practiced witchcraft, and appointed royal mediums and psychics. He did many things that made Jehovah furious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.7'>Manasseh had a carved idol made. Then he set it up in Gods Temple, where God had said to David and his son Solomon: »I have chosen this temple and Jerusalem from all the tribes of Israel. I will put my name here from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.8'>»I will never again remove Israel from the land that I set aside for their ancestors if they will obey all the commandments, all the teachings, the ordinances, and the regulations I gave through Moses.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.9'>Manasseh misled Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem so that they did more evil things than the nations that Jehovah destroyed when the Israelites arrived in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.10'>Jehovah spoke to Manasseh and his people. But they would not pay attention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.11'>So Jehovah made the army commanders of the king of Assyria invade Judah. They took Manasseh captive, put a hook in his nose, put him in bronze shackles, and brought him to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.12'>When he experienced distress, he begged Jehovah his God to be kind and humbled himself in front of the God of his ancestors.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.13'>He prayed to Jehovah. And Jehovah accepted his prayer and listened to his request. Jehovah brought him back to his kingdom in Jerusalem. Then Manasseh knew that Jehovah is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.14'>Then Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David from west of Gihon Spring in the valley to the entrance of Fish Gate. He made the wall go around the Ophel. He built it very high. He put army commanders in every fortified city in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.15'>Manasseh also removed the foreign gods and the idol in Jehovahs Temple. He eliminated the altars he had built in the Temple on Jehovahs mountain and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.16'>He built Jehovahs altar and sacrificed fellowship offerings and thank offerings on it. And he told Judah to serve Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.17'>However the people continued to sacrifice at the illegal places of worship. But they sacrificed only to Jehovah their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.18'>Everything else about Manasseh, including his prayer to his God and the words that the seers spoke to him in the name of Jehovah the God of Israel are in the records of the kings of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.19'>His prayer and how God accepted it are written in the records of Hozai. The things he did before he humbled himself are also written there. This includes all his sins and unfaithfulness and the places where he built illegal worship sites and set up idols and poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.20'>Manasseh lay down in death with his ancestors. They buried him in his own palace. His son Amon succeeded him as king.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.33.22'>He did what Jehovah considered evil, as his father Manasseh had done. Amon sacrificed to all the idols his father Manasseh had made, and he worshiped them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.3'>It was the eighth year of his reign. He was still a boy when he dedicated his life to service of the God of his ancestor David. In his twelfth year as king he purged Judah and Jerusalem by destroying the illegal places of worship, poles dedicated to the goddess Asherah, carved idols, and metal idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.4'>He tore down the altars of the Baal gods. He cut down the incense altars that were above them. He destroyed the Asherah poles, carved idols, and metal idols. He ground them into powder and scattered the powder over the tombs of those who had sacrificed to them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Chr.34.9'>They came to the chief priest Hilkiah and gave him the money that had been brought into Gods Temple.

        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.2'>Josiah appointed the priests to their duties and encouraged them to serve in Jehovahs Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.3'>He told the Levites, who instructed all Israel and performed ceremonies to make themselves holy to Jehovah: Put the Holy Ark in the Temple that Solomon, son of David and king of Israel, built. It should not be carried on your shoulders any longer. Serve Jehovah your God and his people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.4'>Get yourselves ready with the family groups of your divisions, which are listed in the records of King David of Israel and the records of his son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.5'>»Divide yourselves into groups. Then spread out throughout the Temple so that each family of worshipers will be able to get help from one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.6'>»When the people bring you their Passover lamb, you must slaughter it and prepare it to be sacrificed to Jehovah. Make sure the people celebrate according to the instructions Jehovah gave Moses. Do not do anything to become unclean and unacceptable.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.7'>Josiah donated thirty thousand sheep and goats, and three thousand bulls from his own flocks and herds for the people to offer as sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.8'>Josiahs officials also voluntarily gave some of their animals to the people, the priests, and the Levites as sacrifices. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, who were the officials in charge of the Temple, gave the priests twenty-six hundred sheep and lambs and three hundred bulls to sacrifice during the Passover celebration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.9'>Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, and Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the leaders of the Levites, gave the Levites five thousand sheep and goats and five hundred bulls as Passover sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.10'>Thus the service was prepared. The priests took their positions with the Levites according to their divisions, as the king had ordered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.11'>They slaughtered the Passover lambs. The priests sprinkled the blood with their hands while the Levites skinned the lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.12'>They set aside the burnt offerings to give them to the people according to their family divisions. The people could then present them to Jehovah as is written in the Book of Moses. The Levites did the same with the bulls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.13'>The Levites roasted the Passover sacrifices over the fire, according to the regulations. They boiled the sacred offerings in pots, kettles, and pans, and quickly distributed the meat to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.14'>After this was done, the Levites provided meat for themselves and for the priests descended from Aaron. Since the priests were kept busy until night, burning the animals that were burned whole and the fat of the sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.15'>The following musicians of the Levite clan of Asaph were in the places assigned to them by King Davids instructions: Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the kings prophet. The guards at the Temple gates did not need to leave their posts, because the other Levites prepared the Passover for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.16'>Everything was done that day as King Josiah commanded for the worship of Jehovah. This included the keeping of the Passover Festival, and the offering of burnt offerings on the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.17'>All the people of Israel who were present celebrated the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.18'>The Passover had not been celebrated like this since the days of the prophet Samuel. None of the former kings had ever celebrated a Passover like this one celebrated by King Josiah, the priests, the Levites, and the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.19'>This was the eighteenth year of Josiahs reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.20'>Later, when Josiah had repaired the Temple, King Necho of Egypt came to fight a battle at Carchemish at the Euphrates River. Josiah went to attack him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.21'>Neco sent messengers to Josiah. He said: »What is your quarrel with me, king of Judah? I am not attacking you. I have come to fight those who are at war with me. God told me to hurry. God is with me, so stop now or he will destroy you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.22'>But Josiah would not stop his attack. He disguised himself as he went into battle. He refused to listen to Nechos words, which came from God. He went to fight in the valley of Megiddo.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.23'>Some archers shot King Josiah. The king told his officers: »Take me away because I am badly wounded.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.24'>His officers took him out of the chariot and brought him to Jerusalem in his other chariot. He died and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All Judah and Jerusalem mourned for Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.25'>Then Jeremiah chanted a lament for Josiah. All the male and female singers speak about Josiah in their lamentations dirges to this day. They made them an ordinance in Israel. They are also written in the Lamentations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.26'>The rest of the acts of Josiah and his deeds of devotion as written in the law of Jehovah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.35.27'>and his acts, first to last, are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='2Chr.36'>
        <title>KING JEHOAHAZ</title>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.1'>The people of the land crowned Josiahs son Jehoahaz as their new king in Jerusalem in place of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.2'>Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king. He was king in Jerusalem for three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.3'>The king of Egypt removed him from office in Jerusalem and fined the country seven thousand five hundred pounds of silver and seventy-five pounds of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.4'>The king of Egypt made Jehoahazs brother Eliakim king of Judah and Jerusalem and changed Eliakims name to Jehoiakim. Necho took Jehoahaz away to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.5'>Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king. He ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem. He did what Jehovah his God considered evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.6'>Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon attacked Jehoiakim and put him in bronze shackles to take him to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.7'>Nebuchadnezzar also brought some of the utensils of Jehovahs Temple to Babylon. He put them in his palace temple in Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.8'>Everything about Jehoiakim, the disgusting things he did and all the charges against him are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. His son Jehoiakin succeeded him as king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.9'>Jehoiakin was eight years old when he began to rule as king. He was king for three months and ten days in Jerusalem. He did what Jehovah considered evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.10'>In the spring King Nebuchadnezzar sent for Jehoiakin and brought him to Babylon with the valuable utensils from Jehovahs Temple. Nebuchadnezzar made Jehoiakins uncle Zedekiah king of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.11'>Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to rule. He ruled for eleven years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.12'>He did what Jehovah his God considered evil. He did not humble himself in front of the prophet Jeremiah, who spoke Jehovahs word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.13'>Zedekiah also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar. Nebuchadnezzar made Zedekiah swear an oath of allegiance to him in Gods name. But Zedekiah became so stubborn and so impossible to deal with that he refused to turn back to Jehovah the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.14'>All the officials, the priests, and the people became increasingly unfaithful and followed all the disgusting practices of the nations. Although Jehovah made the Temple in Jerusalem holy, they made the Temple unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.15'>Jehovah the God of their ancestors repeatedly sent messages through his prophets because he wanted to spare his people and his dwelling place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.16'>They mocked Gods messengers. They despised his words, and made fun of his prophets until Jehovah became angry with his people. He could no longer heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.17'>So he had the Babylonian king attack them and execute their best young men in their holy temple. He did not spare the best men or the unmarried women, the old people or the sick people. God handed all of them over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.18'>He brought to Babylon each of the utensils from Gods temple, the treasures from Jehovahs Temple, and the treasures of the king and his officials.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.19'>He burned down the Temple and the city, with all its palaces and its wealth, and broke down the city wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.20'>The survivors were taken to Babylonia as prisoners. They served as slaves of the king and his sons, until Persia became a powerful nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.21'>This fulfilled the word of Jehovah that was spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah, until the land had enjoyed its Sabbaths. All the days of its desolation it kept Sabbath until seventy years were complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.22'>In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, in order to fulfill the word of Jehovah by the mouth of Jeremiah, Jehovah stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia. He sent a proclamation throughout his kingdom, and also put it in writing. He said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Chr.36.23'>Thus says Cyrus king of Persia: »Jehovah, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has appointed me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Whoever there is among you of all his people, may Jehovah his God be with him, and let him go up!«</verse>
