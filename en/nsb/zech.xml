        <title>(Writer: Zechariah, means Jehovah Has Remembered) (518 B.C.E.) (Jerusalem)</title>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.1'>The word of Jehovah came to Zechariah the son of Berechiah, the son of Iddo, the prophet. It was in the eighth month, in the second year of Darius the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.2'>Jehovah was very angry with your fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.3'>Tell them, Jehovah of Hosts has said: »Jehovah of Hosts says return to me and I will return to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.4'>»Do not be like your fathers! The former prophets declared: Jehovah of Hosts said, I implore you, return from your evil ways, and from your wicked activities! But they did not listen, they paid no attention to me,« said Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.5'>»Your fathers, where are they? The prophets, do they live forever?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.6'>»I commanded my servants the prophets to obey my words and my statutes. They disregarded them and suffered greatly. Then they repented and admitted that I, Jehovah of Hosts, corrected them as they deserved according to their deeds.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.7'>In the second year that Darius was king, on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month the month of Shebat, Jehovah gave me a message in a vision at night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.8'>He said: »I had a vision in the night. I saw someone riding a red horse. He stopped among some myrtle trees in a valley, and behind him were other horses, red, speckled, and white.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.9'>I asked him, »Sir, what do these horses mean?« He answered: »I will show you what they mean.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.10'>The man answered: »These are they whom Jehovah sent to inspect the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.11'>They spoke to the Messenger Angel of Jehovah who stood among the myrtle-trees: »We have patrolled the earth and the entire world is at rest.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.12'>Then the Messenger Angel of Jehovah said: »Jehovah of Hosts, how much longer until you show compassion to Jerusalem and the cities of Judah? You have been angry with them for seventy years.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.13'>Jehovah replied to the angel that talked with me with gracious and comforting words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.14'>The angel said: »Call out, say, this is what Jehovah of Hosts has said: I am zealous for Jerusalem and for Zion with intense ardor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.15'>And I am very angry with the nations that are at ease secure. I was but a little angered and they caused my anger to grow into fury.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.16'>»Therefore,« said Jehovah: »I will return to Jerusalem with compassion. My house will be built in it,« said Jehovah of Hosts, »and a measuring line will be stretched over Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.17'>»Pronounce again, Jehovah of hosts: My cities will again overflow with prosperity. Jehovah will comfort Zion and yet choose Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.18'>I lifted up my eyes, and saw, and, behold, four horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.19'>I questioned the angel: »What are these?« And he answered me, »These are the horns governments that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.20'>Then Jehovah showed me four craftsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.1.21'>I asked: »What did these come to do?« He answered: »These are the horns that scattered Judah! No man lifted up his head for these came to terrify them. They will cast down the horns powerauthority of the nations that lifted up their horn powerauthority against the land of Judah to scatter it.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.2'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.1'>I lifted up my eyes and saw, behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.2'>Then I asked: »Where are you going?« He said to me: »To measure Jerusalem, to see the width and the length of it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.3'>Behold! The angel went forth and another angel met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.4'>He said to him: »Run and speak to this young man, saying, Jerusalem will be inhabited as villages without walls, by reason of the multitude of men and cattle there.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.5'>Jehovah said: »I will become to her a wall of fire around her, and I will be the glory in the midst of her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.6'>»Flee from the land of the north,« said Jehovah. »I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens,« continued Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.7'>»Escape Zion! You who dwell with the daughter of Babylon should escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.8'>»Jehovah of Hosts proclaims: He sent me after glory! He sent me to the nations that plundered you. For he that touches you touches the pupil of his eye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.9'>»Behold! I will shake my hand power over them, and they will be a spoil to those who served them.« Then you will know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.10'>»Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion! For I am coming, and I will dwell in the midst of you,« said Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.11'>»Many nations will join themselves to Jehovah in that day, and will be my people! I will dwell in the your midst, and you will know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.12'>Jehovah will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will yet choose Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.2.13'>Be silent, all flesh, before Jehovah, for he is aroused out of his holy dwelling.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.3'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.1'>He showed me Joshua the high priest. Joshua was standing before the angel of Jehovah, and Satan was standing at his right hand to be his adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.2'>Jehovah said to Satan: »Jehovah rebukes you, O Satan; yes, Jehovah, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. Is this a brand plucked out of the fire?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.3'>Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and was standing before the angel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.4'>He spoke to those who stood before him: »Take the filthy garments from him. Behold, I have caused your iniquity to pass from you and I will clothe you with rich apparel.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.5'>I said: »Let them set a clean headdress upon his head.« So they set a clean headdress upon his head, and clothed him with garments. The angel of Jehovah was standing nearby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.6'>And the angel of Jehovah witnessed to Joshua, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.7'>»Jehovah of Hosts said: If you will walk in my ways, and if you will keep my ordinance you will judge my house and take care of my courts. I will give you free access among these that stand by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.8'>»Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you. They are men that are a sign. I will bring forth my servant the Branch Sprout!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.9'>»Look at the stone I set before you Joshua. There are seven eyes on one stone. I will engrave the inscription on it,« said Jehovah of Hosts, »and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.3.10'>»In that day,« said Jehovah of Hosts, »you will invite every man and his neighbor under the vine and under the fig tree.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.4'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.1'>The angel who spoke with me returned and woke me from sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.2'>He asked: »What do you see?« I answered: »I see a gold lamp stand, with a bowl on top and seven lamps. There are seven pipes to each of the lamps, which are on the top.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.3'>»There are two olive trees beside it. One is on the right side of the bowl and the other is on the left side of the bowl.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.4'>I asked the angel who spoke to me: »What are these, my lord?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.5'>The angel responded: »Do you not know what these are?« I said, »No, my lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.6'>He answered: »This is the word of Jehovah to Zerubbabel.« Then Jehovah of Hosts said: Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.7'>»Who are you, O Great Mountain? Before Zerubbabel you will become a plain. He will bring the head stone with shouts of blessing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.8'>The word of Jehovah continued to come to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.9'>»The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house. His hands will also finish it! You should know that Jehovah of Hosts has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.10'>»For who has despised the day of small things? For these seven will rejoice, and will see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel. These are the eyes of Jehovah, which run to and fro through the whole earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.11'>I said to him: »What are these two olive-trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left side of it?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.12'>I spoke a second time: »What are these two olive branches, that are beside the two golden spouts, that empty the golden oil from themselves?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.13'>He answered: »You do not know what these are?« I said, »No, my lord.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.4.14'>Then he said: »These are the two anointed ones who stand by Jehovah the God of the whole earth!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.5'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.1'>I opened my eyes again and I saw a flying scroll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.2'>He asked me: »What do you see?« I said: »I see a flying scroll. It is thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.3'>He continued: »This is the curse that is upon the land. Every one who steals will be acquitted. Every one who swears falsely will be innocent.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.4'>»I will cause it to happen,« said Jehovah of Hosts, »and it will enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of he who swears falsely by my name. The curse will abide in the midst of his house and will consume it with the timber and the stones of the house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.5'>Then the angel said: »Lift up your eyes and see what this is that goes forth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.6'>I asked: »What is it?« And he replied: »This is the ephah measure that goes forth. This is their appearance in all the land«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.7'>A round flat weight made of lead was lifted up. There was a woman sitting in the midst of the ephah measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.8'>He said: »This is Wickedness.« He tossed her down into the middle of the ephah measure. He threw the weight of lead on the opening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.9'>Two women came out with the wind in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork. They lifted up the ephah measure between earth and heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.10'>I asked the angel: »Where are they taking the ephah measure?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.5.11'>He answered: »To build her a house temple in the land of Shinar. When it is prepared, she will be moved there to her own place.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.6'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.1'>I opened my eyes again and saw four chariots. They came out from between two mountains. The mountains were mountains of copper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.2'>In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second chariot black horses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.3'>and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot grizzled strong horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.4'>Then I asked the angel: »What are these, my lord?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.5'>The angel answered: »These are the four winds of heaven, which go forth from standing before the Lord of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.6'>»The chariot with the black horses goes toward the North Country. The white went forth after them; and the grizzled went forth toward the South Country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.7'>»The strong ones went forth, and sought to go that they might inspect the earth.« He said: »Go inspect the earth. Search back and forth through out the earth.« So they inspected the earth. They searched back and forth through out the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.8'>Then he cried out to me: »Behold! Those who go toward the North Country have quieted my spirit of anger in the North Country.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.9'>The word of Jehovah continued to come to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.10'>»Take them into captivity, even Heldai, of Tobijah, and of Jedaiah. The same day go into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah. They came from Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.11'>»Take silver and gold and make crowns, and set them upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.12'>»Say to him: Jehovah of Hosts says, »See here, the man whose name is the Branch SproutShootBud. For he will branch out sprout from where he is and he will build the Temple of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.13'>»Yes, he will build the Temple of Jehovah. He will receive the glory, and will sit and rule upon his throne. He will be a priest upon his throne and the counsel of peace will be between the two offices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.14'>»And the crowns will be given to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah. This will be for a memorial in the Temple of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.6.15'>»Those who are far off will come and build in the Temple of Jehovah.« You will know that Jehovah of Hosts sent me to you. This will come to pass if you will diligently obey the voice of Jehovah your God.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Zech.7'>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.1'>The word of Jehovah came to Zechariah in the fourth year of King Darius. It was the fourth day of the ninth month that is Chislev.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.2'>Now they of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regemmelech, and their men, to request the favor of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.3'>Therefore speak to the priests of the house of Jehovah of Hosts, and say to the prophets: »Should I weep in the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these many years?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.4'>Then came the word of Jehovah of Hosts to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.5'>»Speak to all the people of the land and to the priests, saying: For the past seventy years did you fast for me when you fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.6'>»Did you eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.7'>»Should you hear the words that Jehovah cried by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and the cities near her and the South and the lowland were inhabited?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.8'>And the word of Jehovah came to Zechariah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.9'>»Jehovah of Hosts has spoken: Every man should execute true judgment, and show kindness and compassion to his brother!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.10'>»Do not oppress the widow. Do not oppress the fatherless. Do not oppress the stranger and do not oppress the poor. And you should not devise evil in your heart against your brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.11'>»They refused to pay heed, turned a stubborn shoulder resisted, and stopped their ears, that they might not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.12'>»They made their hearts hard like flint and would not listen to the law, and the words that Jehovah of Hosts sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Great anger came from Jehovah of Hosts!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.13'>»I cried, and they would not listen. Now they will cry, and I will not listen, said Jehovah of Hosts!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.7.14'>I will scatter them with a whirlwind among the nations that they have not known. Thus the land was desolate after them, so that no man passed through nor returned. They tread down the pleasant land and made it desolate.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Zech.8.1'>The word of Jehovah of Hosts came to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.2'>Jehovah of Hosts said: »I am zealous for Zion with great ardor, and I am very zealous for her with great rage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.3'>Jehovah of Hosts said: »I have returned to Zion, and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. Jerusalem will be called the city of truth and the mountain of Jehovah of Hosts, the holy mountain.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.4'>Jehovah of Hosts said: »Old men and old women walk with the help of canes in the streets of Jerusalem. They sit in the city square.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.5'>»The streets of the city will be full of boys and girls playing there in the streets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.6'>Jehovah of hosts proclaims: »If it is marvelous in the eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my eyes?« Said Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.7'>Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: »Behold! I will save my people from the land of the east and from the land of the west.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.8'>»I will bring them and they will live in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be their God, in truth and in righteousness!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.9'>Jehovah of hosts said: »Let your hands be strong you who hear these words from the mouth of the prophets. These are words from the day that the foundation of the house of Jehovah of Hosts was laid. It was for the purpose of building the Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.10'>»Before those days, there was no wage for man or beast. The enemy set everyone against his neighbor and going or coming there was no peace.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.11'>»I will not treat the remnant of this people the same as it was in the former days,« said Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.12'>»There will be peace for the seed. The vine will give its fruit. The ground will yield its increase. The heavens will offer their dew and I will cause the remnant of this people to inherit all these things!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.13'>»You were a curse among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel. I will save you! You will be blessed. Do not fear! Be strong!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.14'>Jehovah of hosts said: »I thought to do evil to you, when your fathers provoked me to anger. I have not relented,« Said Jehovah of Hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.15'>»I have again purposed to do good to Jerusalem and the house of Judah. Do not fear!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.16'>»These are the things that you should do. Every man should speak the truth with his neighbor. Execute the judgment of truth and peace in your gates towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.17'>»Let none of you devise evil in your hearts against his neighbor. Do not love a false oath perjury: for all these are things that I hate,« said Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.18'>The word of Jehovah of Hosts came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Zech.8.19'>Jehovah of Hosts said: »The fast of the fourth month, and the fast of the fifth month, the fast of the seventh month, and the fast of the tenth month, will be to the house of Judah joy, gladness, and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace.«</verse>
