      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <title>(Writer: John Mark) (Hebrew Name: John, means Jehovah has shown favor) (60-65 C.E.) (Rome)</title>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>The beginning of the good news about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>The prophet Isaiah wrote: »I am sending my messenger ahead of you to prepare your way.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>»The voice of one crying in the wilderness, prepare the way of Jehovah, make his paths straight.« (Isaiah 40:3)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>John the Baptist was in the desert wilderness telling people to repent turn away from sin and be baptized for forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>People from the province of Judea and the city of Jerusalem went out to hear John. They confessed their sins and he baptized them in the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>John was clothed in camels hair with a leather belt about his loins. He ate locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>He told the people: »The man who comes after me is greater than I am. I am not worthy to stoop down and untie his shoes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>»I baptized immersed you with water, but he will baptize Greek: baptizo: immerse, submerge you with Holy Spirit.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>Soon Jesus came from Nazareth in the province of Galilee. John baptized Jesus in the Jordan River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>When Jesus came out of the water he saw the heavens open and the Spirit descended on him like a dove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>Then a voice came from heaven: « You are my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>At once the Spirit compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness filled with wild animals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>Satan tempted Jesus. This lasted forty days. The angels took care of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>After John was locked in prison Jesus went to Galilee and preached the Good News of God to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>Jesus said: »The time has come. The kingdom of God is at hand. Repent and believe the good news.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Walking by the Sea of Galilee he saw two fishermen Simon and Andrew, Simons brother. They were casting a net into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>Jesus said: Follow me and I will teach you to catch people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>They immediately left the nets and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>Jesus then saw James and John, the sons of Zebedee. They were in a boat preparing their nets to go fishing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>Jesus called them and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and went with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>Jesus and his followers traveled to Capernaum. On the day of worship Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>They were astonished at his doctrine, for he taught with authority and not like the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>Suddenly in the synagogue there was a man with an unclean spirit. He screamed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>»What do you want with us Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are. You are the Holy One of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>Jesus rebuked the spirit by saying: »Be quiet, and come out of him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>The evil spirit shook the man hard, gave a loud scream, and came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>The people were all amazed and questioned. »What is this? What new doctrine is this? He has authority over the unclean spirits, and they obey him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>His fame spread to the entire country of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>Jesus and his disciples, including James and John, left the synagogue and went directly to the home of Simon and Andrew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>Simons mother-in-law was in bed with a fever. At once they told Jesus about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>He took her by the hand and helped her sit up. The fever suddenly left. So she got up and prepared a meal for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>That evening at sunset many sick and demon-possessed people were presented to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>A huge crowd of people from all over Capernaum gathered outside to watch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>Jesus healed many who were sick with various diseases. He cast out many demons. Knowing them he would not permit the demons to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>Early in the morning, long before daybreak, Jesus awoke and went into the wilderness to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>Later Simon and the others went out to find him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>They informed him: »Everyone is asking for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>He replied: »We must go to other towns. I will preach to them too. I came for this purpose.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>He went to Synagogues in every part of Galilee, preaching and driving out evil spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>A man with leprosy knelt in front of Jesus and begged to be healed. »If you want to, you can make me well,« he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>Moved with compassion Jesus touched him. »I want to,« he said. »Be healed!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>Instantly the leprosy disappeared and man was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>Jesus sent him away and warned him. »Go directly to the priest and let him examine you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>»Do not talk to anyone along the way. Take the offering the Law of Moses requires for those healed of leprosy. That way everyone will have proof of your healing.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But the man gave a public account of his healing everywhere he went. Soon crowds surrounded Jesus and he could not enter a town publicly. He had to stay in secluded places and people continued to come to him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>Several days later Jesus returned to Capernaum. The word spread that he was home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>So many people gathered that there was no room left even by the door. Jesus was speaking Gods word to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>Men came to him carrying a paralyzed man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>They could not bring him to Jesus because of the crowd. So they removed the roof over the place where Jesus was. Then they lowered the cot on which the paralyzed man was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jesus saw their faith, he told the man: »Friend your sins are forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Some of the scribes sitting there reasoned in their hearts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>»Why does this man speak this way? He blasphemes for only God is the one who can forgive sins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>Jesus immediately discerned in his spirit that they reasoned within themselves. He asked them: »Why reason these things in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>»Which is easier to say to the sick man your sins are forgiven or take your bed and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>»So you may see that the Son of man has authority to forgive sins on earth,« he said to the man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>»Get up and take your bed, and go to your house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>He got up, took the bed and went out before them all. They were all filled with wonder. They gave glory to God and said we have never seen anything like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>Again he went to the seaside and all the people followed him. So he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>He saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, seated at the place where taxes were collected. He said to him: »Come with me.« And he got up and went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>He was reclining at the meal in his house. Several tax collectors and sinners were at the table with Jesus and his disciples. There were a great number of them, and they came after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>When the scribes of the Pharisees saw he was eating with the tax collectors and sinners they asked his disciples: »Why does he take food and drink with such men?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>Jesus heard this. He said to them: »Those who are well have no need of a medical man but those who are ill do. I have come to care for sinners not the upright.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Johns disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. They came to him and asked: »Why do Johns disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast but your disciples do not?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jesus replied: »Will the friends of a newly married man practice fasting while he is with them? As long as they have him with them they will not go without food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>»But the days will come when the husband will be taken away from them. Then they will fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>»No man puts a patch of new cloth on an old coat. The new, by pulling away from the old, makes a worse hole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>»No man puts new wine into old wineskins. The skins will burst and the wine and the skins will be wasted. New wine has to be put into new wine skins.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>Jesus went through the grain fields on the Sabbath day. While they walked his disciples took the heads of grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>The Pharisees said: »Why are they doing what it is not right to do on the Sabbath?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>He said: »Do you not know of what David did when he needed food for himself and his companions?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>»He went into the house of God when Abiathar was high priest. David took the holy bread for food and gave to his companions. Only the priests may take the holy bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>»The Sabbath was made for man, said Jesus, and not man for the Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>»The Son of man is lord even of the Sabbath.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>He entered the Synagogue again. There was a man there whose hand was withered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>They watched to see if he would heal him on the Sabbath day. Then they might have something against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>He said to the man: »Get up and come forward.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>Then he asked the Pharisees, »Is it right to do good on the Sabbath or to do evil? Is it right to give life or to put to death?« But they said nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>He looked at them and was angry. He was also sad on account of their hard hearts. He said to the man: »Stretch out your hand.« He stretched it out and his hand was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>The Pharisees went away and immediately conspired with the Herodians. They tried to decide how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>Jesus went with his disciples to the sea. A great crowed from Galilee followed. They were also from Judaea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>Jerusalem, Idumaea, beyond the Jordan, and from Tyre and Sidon. These people heard the great things he did and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>He asked his disciples to have a small boat ready because the crowd might press too close to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>He healed many. Others with afflictions pressed close to him that they might touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>The unclean spirits fell down before him and cried: You are the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>He commanded them not to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>He went up on the mountain and invited anyone who wanted to go with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>He appointed twelve to be with him and he sent them out to preach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>He gave them authority to cast out demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>The twelve included Simon whom he surnamed Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>James the son of Zebedee, John the brother of James surnamed Boanerges, which is, Sons of thunder:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Cananaean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>Also present was Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him. Then he went into a house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>The crowd gathered so close that they did not have time for bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>When his own people heard of this they went to apprehend him. They said: »He has lost his senses.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>Scribes that came down from Jerusalem said: »He has Beelzebub. He casts out demons by the prince of the demons.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>Jesus called them to him and spoke to them in illustrations. He asked: »How could Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>»When a kingdom is divided against itself that kingdom cannot stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>»When a house is divided against itself it will not be able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>»If Satan has risen up against himself, he is divided, cannot stand and will come to an end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>»No one can enter into the house of the strong man and steal his property unless he first captures the strong man. Then he will steal his property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>»I tell you sins will be forgiven of the sons of men, and their evil talk will be forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>»But whoever speaks evil and defames Holy Spirit will not be forgiven but is guilty of an eternal sin.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>They exclaimed: »He has an unclean spirit!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>His mother and his brother were standing nearby. They sent for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>A crowd was sitting around him. They said to him: »Look your mother and you brother are outside looking for you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>He answered them: »Who is my mother and who is my brother?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>Looking at the people who sat around him he said: »Behold, my mother and my brother!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>»For whoever does the will of God, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>Again he taught a very great crowd by the seaside. He sat in a boat while the crowd was on the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>He taught them many things by illustrations and said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>»Listen, the sower went out to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>»As he sowed some seed fell by the road and the birds came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>»Other seed fell on the rocky ground and did not have good soil. Immediately it sprang up, because it had no good soil</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>it became scorched when the sun came up. Then it withered because it had no root.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>»Some seed fell among the thorns. The thorns grew up and choked it so it could yield no fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>»Others fell on good ground and yielded fruit. It grew up, increased and produced thirty fold, and sixty fold, and a hundred fold.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>He continued: »He who has ears to hear let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When he was alone his followers including the twelve asked about the illustrations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>He told them: »The secret of the kingdom of God is given to you. Illustrations are spoken to outsiders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>»So that seeing they may see and not perceive. And hearing they may hear and not understand. Otherwise they might repent and be forgiven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>Then he asked: »Do you not understand this illustration? How will you understand any of the illustrations?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>»The sower sows the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>»These are they by the wayside where the word is sown. When they have heard; Satan comes and takes away the word that has been sown in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>»The same is so of the word sown upon the rocky places. When they have heard the word and receive it with joy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while. They stumble when tribulation or persecution arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>»There is the word sown among the thorns. These have heard the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>but the cares of the world, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things enter in and choke the word. So it becomes unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>»Those who represent that sown upon the good soil hear the word and accept it. They bear fruit, thirty fold, and sixty fold, and a hundred fold.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>He asked them: »Is the lamp placed under a bushel, or under a bed, and not on the stand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>»There is nothing hidden unless it should be made known. Nothing is made secret that should come to light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>»If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>Then he said: »Be careful what you listen to. That which is portioned out by you might be portioned to you and more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>»He who has, to him it will be given. He who has not, from him will be taken even that which he has.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>He added: »The kingdom of God is like this. A man plants seed in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>»He sleeps and gets up night and day until the plants grow though he has no idea how.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>»The earth gives fruit by itself. First comes the leaf, then the head, then full grain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>»When the grain is ready he immediately sends men to cut it, because the time for cutting has come.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>He said: »What illustration should we use to picture the kingdom of God? What story will make it clear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>»It is like a grain of mustard seed. When it is planted in the earth it is smaller than all the seeds on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>»But when it is planted it grows and becomes taller than all the plants. It grows out great branches so that the birds of heaven are able to take rest in its shade.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>He spoke the word to them with many illustrations as long as they were able to listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>He spoke only with illustrations. However he made all things clear to his disciples in private.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>When evening arrived Jesus said: Let us go over to the other side.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>They took him with them on the boat and left the people. Other boats were with him also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>A great windstorm came up and the waves came into the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>He was in back of the boat sleeping on a cushion. They woke him. They said: »Master is it nothing to you that we are in danger of destruction?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>He awoke from sleep and commanded the wind and sea. He commanded the sea to be at peace and rest. And he commanded the wind to go down and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>He said: »Why are you full of fear? Do you have no faith?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>Their fear was great. They said to themselves: »Who is this, that even the wind and the sea obey his orders?«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>They traveled to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>Just as he got out of the boat a man with an unclean spirit came to him from the tombs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>He was living in the tombs. No man was able to bind him even with a chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>Often he was bound in chains and iron bands but he would break them. No man was strong enough to keep him still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>Day and night in the tombs and in the mountains he cried out. He would cut himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>He saw Jesus from far off and quickly approached and bowed down before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>Crying out with a loud voice, he said: »What have I to do with you, Jesus, Son of the highest God? In Gods name do not torment me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>Jesus commanded: »Come out of the man you unclean spirit!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>Then Jesus said: »What is your name?« He answered: »My name is Legion because there are a great number of us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>He earnestly implored him not to send the spirits away out of the country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>There was a large herd of pigs feeding on the mountainside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>They pleaded with Jesus: »Send us into the pigs!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>He let them do it. Then the unclean spirits came out and went into the pigs. The herd went rushing down a sharp slope into the sea. About two thousand of them died in the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>Their keepers ran off to the town to tell others what happened. People came to see what had taken place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>When they came to Jesus they saw the man who had been demon possessed. He was fully clothed and in full use of his senses. So they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>Those who saw the event gave a full account of what happened to the man, the evil spirits and the pigs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>They asked Jesus to leave their country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>Entering the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons asked that he might be allowed to travel with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>Jesus told him: »Go to your house and to your friends and tell them about the great things God did for you and how he had mercy on you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>He went away and told others in Decapolis what great things Jesus had done for him. They all marveled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>Again Jesus crossed over in the boat to the other side. A great crowd gathered to him while he was by the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>Jairus, a ruler of the synagogue, saw Jesus and fell at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>He pleaded with him saying: »My little daughter is at the point of death. Please come and lay your hands on her that she will be healed and live.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>Jesus went with him. A great crowd followed him and they pressed very close to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>There was a woman who had an issue of blood twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>She suffered treatment from many physicians but did not become better. She spent all her money and grew worse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>Hearing about Jesus she came though the crowd and touched his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>She said: »If I touch his garments I shall be made whole.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>Immediately the flow of her blood dried up. She felt in her body that she was healed of her affliction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>Suddenly Jesus recognized that power issued from him. He turned to the crowd and asked: »Who touched my garments?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>His disciples said to him: »You see all these people around you and you ask who touched me?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>He looked around to see the woman who had done this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>The woman was afraid and trembled. Knowing what happened she fell down before him, and told him the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>He said: »Daughter your faith has made you whole. Go in peace and be healed of your affliction.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>While he yet spoke they came from the ruler of the synagogues house. They said: »Your daughter is dead. Do not trouble the teacher.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jesus did not listen. He said to the ruler of the synagogue believe and do not fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>He allowed only Peter, James, and John the brother of James to follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>The house of the ruler of the synagogue was filled with commotion. Many were weeping and wailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>He entered and said: »Why all the commotion and why do you weep. The child is not dead but sleeps.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>They laughed him to scorn. He sent them all out of the house. Then he took the father, mother and his companions and went to the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>He took the child by the hand and said to her: »Talitha cumi.« Which means when interpreted, »little girl I say to you arise.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>Immediately the twelve-year old girl rose up and walked. And they were promptly amazed with a great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>He gave them firm orders not to tell any man about this. Then he commanded that she be given something to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>He left there and went to his own country. His disciples followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>Jesus taught in the synagogue on the Sabbath. Many were astonished when they heard him. They asked: »Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to this man and how did he perform these mighty works by his hands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>»Is this the carpenter, the son of Mary, brother of James, Joses, Judas, and Simon? Are not his sisters here with us?« He offended them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>Jesus said to them: »A prophet is not without honor except in his own country, among his own people and in his own house.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>He laid his hands upon a few sick and healed them. Otherwise he did no mighty work there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>He wondered at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>He summoned the twelve and sent them forth in pairs. They were given authority over the unclean spirits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>They were instructed to take nothing for their journey, with the exception of a walking staff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>They were to take no bread, no wallet, no money in their purse and no extra sandals or coat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>He said: »When someone invites you to enter into a house, stay there until you leave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>»When someone will not listen to you leave that house and shake off the dust under your feet for a testimony to the householder.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>They went out to preach that men should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>They cast out many demons. They anointed the sick with oil and healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>John the Baptist had become well known. King Herod heard that John had risen from the dead. Therefore he was doing these powerful works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>But others said: »It is Elijah.« And others said: »It is a prophet, like one of the prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>Herod said: »It is John whom I beheaded, raised from the dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herod captured John and locked him in prison for the sake of Herodias his wife. She was his brother Philips wife before he married her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>John said to Herod: »It is not lawful for you to have your brothers wife.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>Herodias had a grudge against John and was determined to have him killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>But Herod feared John. He knew he was a righteous and holy man so he kept him safe. That is why he listened to John but was perplexed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>It was Herods birthday. He invited his lords, the military commanders, and the prominent men of Galilee to supper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>When the daughter of Herodias danced for Herod and his guests, she pleased him so much he promised her anything she desired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>He pledged to her, »Whatever you ask of me, I will give it to you, up to half of my kingdom.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>She asked her mother, »What should I ask?« And the mother said: »The head of John the Baptist.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>At once she went to the king and asked: »Will you give me the head of John the Baptist on a platter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>The king was very sorry. Even so he kept his promise to her. He did not turn her down. This also showed his dinner guests he was a man of his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>He immediately commanded his guard to behead John the Baptist and bring his head to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>He brought his head on a platter and gave it to the young lady. In turn she gave it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>When his disciples heard this they took his corpse and laid it in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>The apostles gathered together with Jesus. They told him all things they had done and taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>He told them come into a secluded place and rest a while. For there were many people coming and going and they had no leisure time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>They went away in the boat to a secluded place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>The people from all the cities knew they were going and they ran together on foot to arrive ahead of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>When he arrived and saw the great crowd he had compassion on them. They were as sheep without a shepherd. He taught them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>Late in the day his disciples approached him. They said: »The day is almost over and we are in a secluded place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>»Send them away that they may go to the country and villages nearby and buy themselves something to eat.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>He replied: »You give them food to eat.« They asked: »Should we buy two hundred shillings worth of bread to feed them?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>He said« »Find out how many loaves you have? When they knew they said« »Five loaves and two fishes.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>He commanded them to sit down by groups upon the green grass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>They sat down in groups of hundreds, and fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>Then he looked up to heaven and blessed the food. He took the five loaves and the two fishes, and broke the loaves into pieces and gave them to his disciples. He also divided the two fishes. He gave the food to his disciples to serve to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>They all ate and were filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>They collected twelve baskets full of broken pieces of bread and fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Five thousand men ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>Jesus made his disciples hurry into a boat to cross to Bethsaida ahead of him. Then he sent the crowd away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>After he left he went to the mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>He was on the shore at the beginning of evening and the boat was in the midst of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>He saw that they were tired of rowing for the wind was against them. It was the fourth watch of the night. He walked on the sea and was about to pass them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>When they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a spirit an illusion and screamed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>They all saw him and were troubled. Suddenly he spoke to them: »Be of good cheer. It is I do not fear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>He entered the boat and the wind ceased. They were truly amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>They had not understood the loaves of bread. Their minds were closed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>They completed the crossing to the land of Gennesaret and anchored by the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>The people saw him as soon as they left the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>They were wherever he was in the whole region. They carried the sick on their beds to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>When he entered a village or city in the marketplaces or the country the sick tried to touch the border of his garment and be healed.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>The Pharisees and some of the scribes came from Jerusalem to gather around Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>They saw that some of his disciples ate their bread with unwashed defiled hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, do not eat until they wash their hands. They practice the tradition of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>When they come from the marketplace they wash themselves before they eat. They follow many other rules. They wash their cups, and brass pots, and other vessels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>The Pharisees and the scribes asked: »Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders. Instead they eat their bread with defiled hands?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>He told them: »Isaiah prophesied about you hypocrites. It is written: This people honor me with their lips but their heart is far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>They worship me in vain teaching as doctrines the commands of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>Speaking to the Pharisees and scribes He said: »You abandon the commandment of God, and hold fast the tradition of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>»You totally reject the commandment of God that you may keep your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>»Moses said: Honor your father and your mother. He also said: He that speaks evil of father or mother must die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>»But you say: If a man says to his father or his mother that which would benefit you is a gift to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>he no longer has to do anything for his father or mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>»You make the word of God invalid by your tradition.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>He called the crowd again and said: »Listen and understand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>»Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. That which comes from inside of a man can make him unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>»If any man has ears to hear, let him hear.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>When he entered the house away from the crowd his disciples asked him to explain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>He replied: »Do you not understand? Do you not know that which goes into the man from the outside cannot defile him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>»It is because it does not go into his heart, but into his stomach and is eliminated? All foods are clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>»That which comes out of the man defiles the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>»It is from the heart that evil thoughts come such as: fornications, thefts, murders, adulteries,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>coveting, wickedness, deceit, loose conduct, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>»All these evil things come from within and defile the man.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>Jesus went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He did not want anyone to know that he was staying in a house there. However it could not be kept a secret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>A woman whose little daughter had an evil spirit heard about Jesus. She went to him and bowed down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>The woman was a Greek Syrophoenician by race. She wanted him to drive out the demon out of her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>He said to her: »Let the children be fed first. It is not proper to take the childrens bread and cast it to the dogs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>She answered: »Yes Lord, even the dogs under the table eat from the childrens crumbs.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>Then he replied: »Thanks to your answer you may leave for the demon has gone out of your daughter.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>She went to her house and found the child on the bed with the demon gone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>He left the borders of Tyre through Sidon, through the region of Decapolis to the Sea of Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>They brought a deaf man with an impediment in his speech to him and asked him to lay his hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>Jesus took him aside from the crowd privately, and put his fingers into his ears, and he spat, and touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>Looking up to heaven he sighed and said to him: »Ephphatha, that is, be opened.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>His ears were opened. His tongue was freed and he spoke plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>Jesus told them not to tell anyone. The more he told them not to talk the more they talked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>They were beside themselves with amazement saying: He makes even the deaf hear and the dumb speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>It was one of those days when there was a great crowd of people. They had nothing to eat so he called his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>Jesus said: »I am concerned for these people because they continue with me now three days, and have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>»If I send them away to their houses with no food they will be weak and faint. Some of them have a long way to go.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>His disciples answered, »How could we get enough bread in this desolate place?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>Jesus responded: »How much bread do you have?« They said: »Seven loaves.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>He made the people sit on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He gave the broken bread to his disciples and they served the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>They had some small fish. After blessing them he had them serve the people in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>After eating they picked up seven baskets full of food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>About four thousand ate. Then he sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>Immediately he entered a boat and he and his disciples traveled to Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>The Pharisees came to question him. They were testing him and seeking a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>He sighed deeply in his spirit and said: »Why does this generation seek a sign? I tell you truly no sign will be given to this generation.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>He left them and boarded the boat and departed to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>They forgot to take bread and they only had one loaf with them in the boat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>He ordered them to be aware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>They reasoned with one another saying: »We have no bread.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>Hearing this Jesus said: »Why do you reason about having no bread? Do you not understand? Are your hearts dull of understanding?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>»Having eyes, do you not see? Having ears, do you not hear? And do you not remember?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.19'>»When I broke the five loaves among the five thousand how many baskets full of broken pieces did you up bring back?« They answered: »Twelve.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.20'>And the seven loaves among the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you bring back? And they told him: »Seven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>He said: Do you not yet understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>They arrived at Bethsaida. A blind man was brought to him with the request to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.23'>He held the blind mans hand and led him out of the village. Then he spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him. He asked him: »Do you see?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>He answered: »I see men. They look like trees walking.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>He laid his hands on his eyes again and his vision was fully restored, he saw everything clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>He sent him to his home saying: »Do not enter into the village.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>Jesus and his disciples went into the villages of Caesarea Philippi. On the way he asked his disciples: »Who do men say I am?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>They told him: »John the Baptist and others say Elijah. Some say you are one of the prophets.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>»Who do you say I am,« Jesus asked. They told him: »You are the Christ.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.30'>He commanded them not to tell any man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>Then he taught them that the Son of man must suffer many things. The elders, chief priests, and the scribes will reject him. He will be killed and after three days he will rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>Jesus spoke openly about this. Peter took him aside and rebuked him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>He turned around and looked at his disciples. Then he rebuked Peter saying: »Get behind me Satan for you do not pay attention to the things of God. You tend to the things of men.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>He then spoke to both his disciples and the crowd. He said: »If any man would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his stake and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>»Whoever would save his life will lose it. Whoever would lose his life for my sake and the sake of the Good News will save it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.36'>»What does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>»What should a man give in exchange for his life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>»For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him, when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.1'>He continued: »Truly I tell you there are some here who will in no way experience death, till they see the kingdom of God come with power.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>Six days later Jesus took Peter, James and John up on a high mountain completely alone. He was transfigured in front of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>His garments became brilliant white. Nothing on earth could make them this white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>Elijah and Moses appeared before them. They were talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>Peter said to Jesus: »Teacher it is good for us to be here. Let us make three tabernacles, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.6'>Peter and the others were afraid and they did not know what to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>A cloud hovered over them and a voice came out of the cloud: »This is my Son the beloved listen to him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>Suddenly they saw no one near them except Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>They came down the mountain. He warned them not to tell anyone what they had seen until after the Son of man had risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>They kept questioning among themselves what the rising from the dead means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>Then they asked him how is it that the scribes say that Elijah must first come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>He said: »Elijah does come first and restores all things. It is written that the Son of man should suffer and be treated with contempt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.13'>»But I say to you that Elijah has come. They have done to him what ever they wished just as it is written about him.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>When they came to the disciples they saw a great crowd with them and scribes questioning them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>Suddenly the crowd saw him and ran to him to greet him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>He asked them: »What are you talking about?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>One of the people answered him: »Teacher I brought my son who is unable to talk because of a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>»The spirit seizes him and slams him down. He foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth. I asked your disciples to cast it out but they could not do it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>Jesus then said: »O faithless generation. How long will I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>They brought the boy to him. Suddenly the spirit threw him into convulsions. He fell on the ground rolled around and foamed at the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>Jesus asked his father: »How long has this been going on?« He said: »Since he was a child.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>Often it casts him into the fire and into the water to destroy him. If you can do anything have compassion on us and help us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.23'>Jesus said to him: »All things are possible to him who has faith.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>Both father and child immediately shouted: »I have faith make my faith stronger.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>When Jesus saw the people he ordered the unclean spirit to come out of him. He commanded the spirit that caused the loss of voice and hearing to leave and never return to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>The spirit cried out and shook the child violently. It came out and the child became like a dead person. Most of them said: »He is dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.27'>Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>When the child went into the house his disciples asked him privately: »Why were we unable to send it out?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>He replied: Only prayer will make this sort come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>He desired that no man know about it. Therefore they left there through Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>He taught his disciples: »The Son of man will be handed over to men who will put him to death. After three days he will come back from the dead.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.32'>They did not understand and they were afraid to ask him about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.33'>They traveled to Capernaum. When they were in the house he asked them: »What were you talking about on the way?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.34'>They said nothing because they had had an argument between themselves about who was the greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.35'>He sat down and the twelve came to him. He said: »If any man has the desire to be first, he would be last of all and servant of all.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.36'>He put a little child in the middle of them and taking him in his arms he said to them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.37'>»Whoever receives a little child in my name, receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.38'>John spoke up: »Teacher, we saw someone who does not follow us casting out demons in your name. We tried to stop him because he does not follow us.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.39'>But Jesus said: »Do not stop him, for there is no one who will do a mighty work in my name, and be able quickly to speak evil of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.40'>»For whoever is not against us is on our side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.41'>»Whoever will give you a cup of water to drink in my name, because you are Christs, most assuredly I tell you, he will in no way lose his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.42'>»Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hanged about his neck and he were cast into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.43'>»If your hand causes you to stumble, cut it off. It would be better to enter into life maimed then, having two hands to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the Valley of Hinnom. Greek: Gehenna</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.44'>spurious, but included in King James Version, »Where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched.« </verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.45'>»If your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off. It is good for you to enter into life with only one foot, rather than having two feet to be cast into the ever-burning fires of Hinnom. Greek: Gehenna: symbolic of total destruction</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.46'>The same wording as verse 44, spurious: Tischendorfs Spurious Passages</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>»If your eye causes you to stumble, cast it out. It is good for you to enter into the kingdom of God with one eye, rather than having two eyes to be destroyed in the ever-burning trash fires in the valley of Hinnom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.48'>»For the worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.« Questionable passage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.49'>»For every one will be salted with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.50'>»Salt is good. If it loses its saltiness how can you make it salty again? Have the salt or seasoning of friendship among yourselves, and live in peace with one another.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.10'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.1'>Jesus crossed the Jordan River when he went to the province of Judea. Crowds gathered all around him just as they always did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.2'>Some Pharisees came to him and tried to trap him. »Does our Law allow a man to divorce his wife?« They asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.3'>»What did Moses command you?« Jesus asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.4'>They said: »Moses allowed us to write a certificate of divorce and send her away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.5'>»He wrote this commandment because of your hard hearts,« Jesus replied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.6'>»God made male and female from the beginning of creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.7'>»For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and unite with his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.8'>»The two shall become one flesh. They are no longer two, but one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.9'>»That which God has joined together let not man take apart separate.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.10'>In the house the disciples asked him again about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.11'>He said: »He who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.12'>»If she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.13'>People were bringing little children to him so he could touch them. His disciples turned them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.14'>But when Jesus saw it he was moved with indignation. He said: »Allow the little children to come to me! Do not turn them away for they belong to the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.15'>»Truly I tell you, he who does not receive the kingdom of God like a little child shall not enter it.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.16'>He took them in his arms, put his hands upon them and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.17'>As he traveled someone ran to him, kneeled and asked him: »Good Teacher, what shall I do that I may inherit everlasting life?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.18'>Jesus asked him: »Why do you call me good? None is good except God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.19'>»You know the commandments, do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not bear false witness, do not defraud, honor your father and mother.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.20'>»Teacher,« he said: »I have observed all of these from my youth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.21'>Jesus lovingly looked at him and said: »You lack one thing. Go, sell your possessions and give to the poor. Then you will have treasure in heaven. Then come and follow me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.22'>He was very sad when he heard this for he had many possessions. Then he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.23'>Looking around Jesus said to his disciples: »It is hard for those who have riches to enter into the kingdom of God!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.24'>The disciples were amazed at his words. Jesus repeated it again: »Children, it is hard to enter into the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.25'>»It is easier for a camel to go through a needles eye, than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.26'>They were greatly astonished! So they asked him: »Who can be saved?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.27'>Jesus looked at them: »With men it is impossible, but not with God: for all things are possible with God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.28'>Peter said to him: »We have left all and followed you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.29'>Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, a man that has left house, or brothers, or sisters, or mother, or father, or children, or lands, for my sake, and for the sake of the good news,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.30'>will receive a hundred times as much now in this time, and in the age to come everlasting life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.31'>»Many that are first will be last and the last first.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.32'>Jesus went to Jerusalem. The disciples followed him. They were amazed at what Jesus did. Others followed and were afraid. He met with the twelve to tell them the things that were to happen to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.33'>»When we go to Jerusalem the Son of man will be turned over to the chief priests and the scribes. They will condemn him to death and hand him over to the people of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.34'>»They will mock him, spit on him, and scourge him. Then they will kill him. After three days he will rise again.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.35'>James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to him saying: »Teacher, we want you to do for us what we ask of you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.36'>He asked: »What do you want me to do for you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.37'>They said to him: »Allow us to sit next to you in your glory. One could sit on your right hand, and one on your left hand.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.38'>»You do not know what you ask,« Jesus replied. »Are you able to drink the cup that I drink? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.39'>They said: »We are able.« Jesus replied: »The cup that I drink you will drink; and with the baptism that I am baptized you will be baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.40'>»But to sit on my right hand or on my left hand is not mine to give. It is for them for whom it has been prepared.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.41'>When the ten heard it they were indignant with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.42'>Jesus called them together and said: »You know that those who rule over the nations lord it over them. Their great ones exercise authority over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.43'>»It is not so among you. Whoever would become great among you, shall be your minister servantattendant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.44'>»Whoever would be first among you, shall be servant of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.45'>»For the Son of man also came not to be ministered to, but to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.46'>They arrived at Jericho. He left there with his disciples and a large crowd. A blind beggar named Bartimaeus, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the side of the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.47'>When he heard that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he cried: »Jesus, son of David, have mercy on me!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.48'>Many rebuked him that he should keep quiet. However he cried out even more: »You son of David have mercy on me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.49'>Jesus stood still and said: »You call him.« They called the blind man saying to him, »Be of good cheer: rise, he calls you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.50'>Setting aside his garment, he sprang up, and came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.51'>Jesus responded to him: »What do you want me to do for you?« The blind man said to him: »Teacher I want to receive my sight!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.10.52'>Jesus told him: »Go your way; your faith has made you whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed him in the way.«</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.11'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.1'>They came close to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives. He appointed two of his disciples to</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.2'>go into the village that is nearby. »As soon as you enter it you will find a colt tied there. No man has ever sat on that colt. Untie him and bring him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.3'>»If any one questions why you do this say: The Lord has need of him. Immediately he will send it here.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.4'>They found a colt tied at the door in the open street and they untied it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.5'>Those who stood there asked why are you untying the colt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.6'>They told them what Jesus said and they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.7'>The colt was brought to Jesus. They laid their garments on him and Jesus sat on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.8'>Many spread their garments along the way. Others spread branches, which they cut from the fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.9'>Those who led the way and those who followed cried: »Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in Jehovahs name!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.10'>»Blessed is the coming kingdom, the kingdom of our father David. Hosanna in the highest!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.11'>He entered Jerusalem and went to the temple. When evening came he went with the twelve to Bethany.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.12'>The next day they left Bethany. He was hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.13'>He saw a fig tree far off. When he got closer he found nothing but leaves for it was not the season of figs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.14'>He spoke about the tree that no man would ever eat fruit from it from that day forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.15'>When in Jerusalem he entered the temple and turned over the tables of the moneychangers and the seats of the people who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.16'>He would not allow any man to carry merchandise through the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.17'>When he taught, he said: »Is it not written, my house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations? But you have made it a den of robbers.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.18'>The chief priests and the scribes heard it, and sought how they might destroy him. They feared him because the crowd was astonished at his teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.19'>And every evening he left the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.20'>They passed by in the morning and saw the fig tree withered away from the roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.21'>Peter remembered and said: »Teacher look, the fig tree that you cursed is withered away.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.22'>Jesus answered: »Have faith in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.23'>»Truly I say faithful ones shall say to this mountain, be cast into the sea and it will happen. There must be no doubt in his heart and he must believe that what he says will come to pass.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.11.28'>They said to him: »By what authority do you do these things? Or who gave you authority to do these things?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.29'>Jesus said: »I will ask you one question. Give me an answer, and I will say by what authority I do these things.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.30'>»The baptism of John was it from heaven or from men?« Give me an answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.31'>They thought about it among themselves saying: »If we say from heaven he will say why did you not have faith in him?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.32'>They feared the people. »If we say from men the people would not like it because they all thought John was a true prophet.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.11.33'>They told Jesus« »We have no idea.« Jesus said to them: »I should not say to you by what authority I do these things.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>He taught them with illustrations: »A man had a vineyard planted. He built a wall around it. He prepared a place for crushing out the wine and put up a tower. Then he rented it out to field workers, and went into another country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>»During the season he sent a servant to the field workers that he might receive the fruits of the vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>»They beat him and sent him away empty.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>They tried to capture him but feared the crowd. They perceived that he spoke the illustration against them. So they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.13'>Pharisees and Herodians went to him that they might catch him in talk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>»Teacher,« they said, »we know that you are truthful, and not concerned about what other people think. You truthfully teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>»Should we pay or should we not pay?« Knowing their hypocrisy he said to them:« Why do you test me? Show me a denarius.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>Sadducees say that there is no resurrection. They came to him to ask a question:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>The scribe said to him: »It is true teacher youve said it well that he is one and there is no one else besides him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>»To love him with all the heart, and with all understanding, and with total strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is much more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.1'>It was just two days until the feast of the Passover and the unleavened bread. The chief priests and the scribes sought how they might quietly capture and kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.2'>They said: »Not during the feast for it might cause the people to riot.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.3'>He was in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper. While he was dining a woman with an alabaster vase filled with costly perfume, of pure nard spikenard, brake it open and poured it over his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.4'>Some were very indignant over this. They asked, »What was the purpose of this waste of ointment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.5'>»This ointment might have been sold for more than three hundred denarii. And the money could have been given to the poor. They scolded her.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.6'>Jesus said: »Let her alone. Why do you trouble her? She did a good thing to me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.10'>Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve, went away to the chief priests, that he might betray Jesus to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.11'>They were glad to hear it and promised to give him money. He looked for ways how he might conveniently deliver Jesus to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.12'>Now it was the first day of unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Passover. His disciples said to him: »Where do you want to go to prepare to eat the Passover?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.13'>He sent two of his disciples into the city. He said: »Meet a man bearing a pitcher of water and follow him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.14'>»Where he leads you say to the master of the house: The Teacher says where is my guest-chamber? Where I shall eat the Passover with my disciples?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.16'>The disciples went to the city and found everything as he described and they prepared for the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.17'>When it was evening he came with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.18'>While they sat and ate Jesus said: »Truly I tell you, one of you will betray me, even he that eats with me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.19'>They were sorrowful and said to him one by one: »Is it I?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.20'>He said to them: »It is one of the twelve, he that dips with me in the dish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.21'>»The Son of man goes even as it is written of him. Woe to that man through whom the Son of man is betrayed! It would have been better if he had not been born.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.22'>While they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it, he gave the broken bread to them, and said: »Take it, this means represents my body.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.23'>He took a cup, and when he had given praise, he gave it to them and they all had a drink from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.24'>He said: »This means represents my blood of the covenant given for men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.26'>After a song of praise to God they went to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.27'>Jesus told them: »You would all be turned away from me. It is written, I will put the keeper of the sheep to death, and the sheep will be put to flight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.28'>»After I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee.«</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.30'>Jesus said to Peter: »I tell you that before the rooster crows twice tonight, you will say three times that you do not know me.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.31'>Peter answered even more strongly: »I will never say that, even if I have to die with you!« All the other disciples said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.32'>They came to a place called Gethsemane. He said to his disciples: »Sit here while I pray.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.33'>He took Peter, James and John with him. He was very distressed and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.34'>He said to them: »I am very sorrowful to the point of death. Stay here with me and watch.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.35'>He went forward a little ways and fell on the ground to pray. He prayed that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.36'>He said: »Abba, Father, all things are possible to you. Take this cup from me. Even so not what I will, but what you will.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.37'>He returned to find them sleeping. He said to Peter, »Simon why do you sleep? Could you not watch for one hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.38'>»To avoid temptation watch and pray. The spirit truly is willing but the flesh is weak.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.39'>Again he went away and prayed, and spoke the same words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.40'>He came and found them asleep again. They did not know what to say to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.41'>He came a third time and said to them: »Sleep and take your rest. It is enough the hour has come. Look, the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.42'>»Rise up and let us go. He that betrays me is near.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.43'>Suddenly, as he spoke, Judas one of the twelve arrived. A great crowd with swords and spears were with him. They were from the chief priests, scribes and elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.44'>He who betrayed him gave them a sign. He told them the one I kiss is the one to capture and take away safely.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.45'>When he arrived he went straight to him and said: »Master« and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.46'>They grabbed him and took him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.47'>One of those who were near took out his sword and gave the servant of the high priest a blow, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.48'>Jesus said: »Have you come out as against a thief with swords and sticks to take me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.49'>»I was with you every day in the Temple teaching and you did not take me. This is done so that the scriptures will be fulfilled.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.50'>They all left him, and fled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.51'>A young man followed him. He was wearing a linen cloth over his naked body. They tried to grab him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.52'>But they got a hold of the linen cloth and he fled naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.53'>They led Jesus away to the high priest. The chief priests, elders and scribes came together with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.54'>Peter followed him at a distance. He followed into the court of the high priest. He was sitting with the officers staying warm by the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.55'>Now the chief priests and the whole council looked for witness against Jesus to put him to death. They found none.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.56'>Many gave false witness against him. But their witness was not in agreement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.57'>One person falsely witnessed against him by saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.58'>»We heard him say, I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another made without hands.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.59'>Even so their witness did not agree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.60'>The high priest stood in the middle of them, and said to Jesus: »Do you not answer? What is it these say against you?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.61'>But he kept quiet and said nothing. Again the high priest questioned him: »Are you the Christ, the son of the Holy One?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.62'>Jesus said: »I am and you will see the Son of man seated at the right hand of power, and coming with the clouds of heaven.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.63'>Violently parting his robes, the high priest said: »What need do we have for more witnesses?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.64'>We have heard his words against God. What is your opinion? They all said he should be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>Some spit on him and covering his face they gave him blows. Guess who hit you, they said. The leaders took him and beat him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>Peter was still in the courtyard when one of the High Priests servant women came by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>When she saw Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said: »You were with Jesus of Nazareth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>He denied it. »I do not know and I do not understand what you are talking about,« he answered. He went out into the passageway.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>The servant woman saw him there and told bystanders, »He is one of them!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>Peter denied it again. Later the bystanders accused Peter again saying: »You cannot deny that you are one of them, because you, too, are from Galilee.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>Then Peter said: »I swear I am telling the truth! May God punish me if I lie! I do not know the man you are talking about!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>Then a rooster crowed. Peter remembered what Jesus said: »Before the rooster crows two times, you will deny me three times.« He broke down and cried.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>Early in the morning the chief priests met hurriedly with the elders, the teachers of the Law, and the entire Council. They made their plans. They led Jesus away in chains and handed him over to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>Pilate questioned him: »Are you the king of the Jews?« Jesus answered: »You say so.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>The chief priests accused him of many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>Pilate again asked him: »Do you not answer? See how many things they testify against you!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But Jesus gave no answer. Pilate wondered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>He used to release one prisoner at the feast. This was done by request.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>Barabbas, a rebel and a murderer was available for this purpose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>The crowd cried aloud and asked him to do as he always did for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>Pilate answered them, saying: »Do you want me to release to you the King of the Jews?«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For he knew that it was out of envy the chief priests delivered him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>The chief priests influenced the crowd, that he should release Barabbas to them instead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>»What should I do with the one you call the King of the Jews?« Pilate asked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>They cried out: »Impale him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Pilate said: »Why, what evil has he done?« But they cried out exceedingly, »Impale him!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>Wishing to please the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. Then he handed over Jesus. He was flogged and impaled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>The soldiers led him away to the court in the Praetorium building governors palace. They assembled together all of the troops.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>They clothed him with purple. After weaving a crown of thorns they put it on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>»Hail King of the Jews!« They shouted at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>They struck his head with a reed and spat on him. They bowed their knees in false adoration to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>After they mocked him, they took the purple off of him, and put his own garments on him. They led him out to impale him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus was passing by on the road. They compelled forced him to go with them, that he might carry his stake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>They brought him to the place called Golgotha. This means the place of a skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>They offered him wine mixed with myrrh to drink, but he did not take it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>After impaling him, they divided his garments among themselves, casting lots for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>It was the third hour. They impaled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>The superscription of his accusation was written on a board above his head, »THE KING OF THE JEWS.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>They impaled two robbers with him, one on his right hand, and one on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>The Scripture was fulfilled, which says, »He was numbered with transgressors.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>Those who passed by blasphemed him, wagging their heads, and saying, »ha! You who destroy the temple, and build it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>save yourself, and come down from the stake!«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>Likewise, also the chief priests mocked among themselves with the scribes said, »He saved others. He cannot save himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>»Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down from the stake that we may see and believe him.« Those who were impaled with him also mocked him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>They filled a sponge full of vinegar, put it on a reed, and gave it to him to drink. Then they said let him be. Let us see whether Elijah comes to take him down.</verse>
