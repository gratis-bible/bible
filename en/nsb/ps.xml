        <verse osisID='Ps.77.1'>My cry goes to God! Indeed, I cry to God for help, and he listened to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.77.2'>In the day of my trouble I sought Jehovah. My hand was stretched out in the night, and did not get tired. I refused to be comforted.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ps.77.4'>You hold my eyelids open. I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.77.5'>I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.77.6'>I remember my song in the night. I consider in my own heart; my spirit diligently inquires:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.77.7'>Will Jehovah reject us forever? Will he be favorable no more?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.77.8'>Has his loving kindness vanished forever? Does his promise fail for generations?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.77.9'>Has God forgotten to be gracious? Has he, in anger, withheld his compassion?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.77.10'>Then I thought: I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most High.</verse>

        <title>Of Asaph</title>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.1'>Listen, O my people, to my law. Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.2'>I will open my mouth in an illustration. I will utter dark sayings of old,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.3'>That we have heard and known and our fathers have told us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.4'>We will not conceal them from their children, but tell to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, and his strength and his wondrous works that he has done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.5'>He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel. This he commanded our fathers that they should teach them to their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.6'>That the generation to come might know, the children to be born, that they may arise and tell to their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.7'>That they should put their confidence in God and not forget the works of God but keep his commandments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.8'>They should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation that did not prepare its heart and whose spirit was not faithful to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.9'>The sons of Ephraim were archers well equipped with bows. Yet they turned and ran in the day of battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.10'>They did not keep the covenant of God. They refused to walk in his law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.11'>They forgot his deeds and his miracles that he had shown them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.12'>He wrought wonders before their fathers in the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.13'>He divided the sea and caused them to pass through. He made the waters stand up like a heap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.14'>He led them with the cloud by day and with a light of fire by night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.15'>He split the rocks in the wilderness and gave them abundant drink like the ocean depths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.16'>He brought forth streams also from the rock and caused waters to run down like rivers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.17'>Yet they still continued to sin against him. They rebelled against the Most High in the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.18'>In their heart they put God to the test by asking food according to their desire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.19'>Then they spoke against God. They said: Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.20'>Behold, He struck the rock so that waters gushed out, and streams were overflowing; Can He give bread also? Will He provide meat for His people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.21'>Therefore Jehovah heard and was full of wrath. A fire was kindled against Jacob and anger also mounted against Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.22'>Because they did not believe in God and did not trust in his salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.23'>Yet he commanded the clouds above and opened the doors of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.24'>He rained down manna upon them to eat and gave them food from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.25'>Man did eat the bread of angels. He sent them food in abundance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.26'>He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens and by his power he directed the south wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.27'>He rained meat upon them like the dust, even winged fowl like the sand of the seas,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.28'>Then he let them fall in the midst of their camp, round about their dwellings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.29'>So they ate and were well filled, and their desire he gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.30'>Before they had satisfied their desire, while their food was in their mouths,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.31'>The anger of God rose against them and killed some of their stoutest ones, and subdued the choice men of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.32'>In spite of all this they still sinned. They did not believe in his wonderful works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.33'>He brought their days to an end like a whisper in the wind. He brought their years to an end in terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.34'>When he killed some of them, the rest searched for him. They turned from their sins and eagerly looked for God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.35'>They remembered that God was their rock, that the Most High was their defender.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.36'>They flattered him with their mouths and lied to him with their tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.37'>Their hearts were not loyal to him. They were not faithful to his promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.38'>But he is compassionate. He forgave their sin. He did not destroy them. He restrained his anger many times. He did not display all of his fury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.39'>He remembered that they were only flesh and blood, a breeze that blows and does not return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.40'>How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness! How often they caused him grief in the desert!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.41'>They tested God again and again, and they pushed the Holy One of Israel to the limit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.42'>They did not remember his power and the day he freed them from their oppressor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.43'>when he performed his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders in the fields of Zoan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.44'>He turned their rivers into blood so that they could not drink from their streams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.45'>He sent a swarm of flies that bit them and frogs that ruined them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.46'>He gave their crops to grasshoppers and their produce to locusts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.47'>He killed their vines with hail and their fig trees with frost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.48'>He let the hail strike their cattle and bolts of lightning strike their livestock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.49'>He sent his fierce burning anger, his rage and fury against them. He sent an army of destroying angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.50'>He cleared a path for his anger. He did not spare them from death. He let the plague take their lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.51'>He destroyed every firstborn in Egypt, the ones born in the tents of Ham when their fathers were young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.52'>He led his own people out like sheep and guided them like a flock through the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.53'>He led them safely. They had no fear while the sea covered their enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.54'>He brought them into his holy land, to this mountain that his power had won.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.55'>He drove nations out of their way and gave them the land of the nations as their inheritance. He settled the tribes of Israel in their own tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.56'>They tested God Most High and rebelled against him. They did not obey his written instructions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.57'>They were disloyal and treacherous like their ancestors. They were like arrows shot from a defective bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.58'>They provoked him to anger indignation because of their illegal worship sites. They made him furious because they worshiped idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.59'>When God heard, he became furious. He greatly abhorred Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.60'>He abandoned his dwelling place in Shiloh, the tent where he had lived among humans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.61'>He allowed his power to be taken captive and handed his glory over to an oppressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.62'>He let swords kill his people. He was furious with those who belonged to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.63'>Fire consumed his best young men, so his virgins were not given in marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.64'>His priests were cut down with swords. The widows of his priests could not even weep for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.65'>Jehovah woke up like one who had been sleeping, like a warrior sobering up from too much wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.66'>He struck his enemies from behind and disgraced them forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.67'>He rejected the tent of Joseph. He did not choose the tribe of Ephraim,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.68'>but he chose the tribe of Judah, Mount Zion he loved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.69'>He built his holy place to be like the high heavens, like the earth that he made to last for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.70'>He chose his servant David. He took him from the sheep pens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.71'>He brought him from tending the ewes that had lambs so that David could be the shepherd of the people of Jacob, of Israel, the people who belonged to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ps.78.72'>With unselfish devotion David became their shepherd. With skill he guided them.</verse>
