      <chapter osisID='1Tim.1'>
        <title>(Writer: Paul) (61-64 C.E.) (Macedonia)</title>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.1'>Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the commandment of God our Savior, and Christ Jesus our hope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.2'>to Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, peace, from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.3'>As I urged you to stay at Ephesus, when I was going into Macedonia, that you might command certain men not to teach strange doctrines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.4'>They should not pay attention to myths and endless genealogies. These myths false storiesfabrications and genealogies stimulate questions and speculation. They do not enhance the administration of God that is by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.5'>But the objective is love out of a pure heart and a good conscience and faith without hypocrisy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.6'>Some have turned aside to vain talk by deviating from these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.7'>They want to be teachers of the Law even though they do not know what they are talking about. They do not understand what they say or what they confidently affirm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.8'>But we know that the Law is good, if a man uses it legitimately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.9'>Knowing this, that Law is not made for a righteous person. It is for the lawless and unruly, the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for murderers of fathers and murderers of mothers, and for manslayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.10'>It is for fornicators, for abusers of themselves with men, for kidnappers, for liars, for perjurers, and everything else that is contrary to the sound teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.11'>Sound teaching doctrine is according to the good news of the glory of the blessed happy God. This was committed to my trust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.12'>I thank him that enabled me and counted me faithful, appointing me to his service, Christ Jesus our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.13'>I was a blasphemer, and a persecutor, and a violent aggressor. I was shown mercy, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.14'>The grace of our Lord abounded exceedingly with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.15'>Faithful is the saying, and worthy of acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am foremost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.16'>For this I obtained mercy, which in me as the foremost sinner Jesus Christ might show his long-suffering. This is for an example to those who should later believe in him for eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.17'>Now to the King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.18'>I entrust this command to you, Timothy, my son. It is in accordance with the prophecies that were previously made. They do apply to you, and with them you may fight the good fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.19'>Keep the faith and maintain a good conscience! Some have rejected these things and have suffered shipwreck to their faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.1.20'>Among these are Hymenaeus and Alexander. I handed them over to Satan, so that they will be taught not to blaspheme.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.1'>I urge that entreaties and prayers, petitions and thanksgivings, be made on behalf of all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.2'>They should be made for kings and all who are in authority, so that we may lead a tranquil and quiet life in all godliness and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.3'>This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.4'>It is Gods desire that all men have salvation and come to the full preciseaccuratecorrect knowledge Greek: epignosis: recognition, discernment of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.5'>There is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.6'>He gave himself as a ransom for all. A witness was to be given at the right time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.7'>Because of this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle. What I say is true, not false, and I am a teacher of the nations in the true faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.8'>I want the men in every place to pray, lifting up holy hands, without anger or argument.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.9'>Likewise I want women to be adorned in modest clothing, with modesty and soundness of mind; not with braided hair, and gold or pearls or costly clothes;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.10'>but that which becomes a woman professing godliness through good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.11'>Let a woman learn in silence with all subjection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.12'>I do not permit a woman to teach or have dominion over a man, but to remain quiet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.13'>Adam was first formed and then Eve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.14'>Adam was not deceived, but the woman being deceived fell into transgression.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.2.15'>She will be saved through her childbearing, if they continue in faith, love, and sanctification with sobriety.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.1'>Faithful is the saying: If a man seeks the office of overseer, he desires a good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.2'>The overseer therefore must be without reproach, the husband of one wife, temperate in habits, sound in mind, orderly, hospitable, qualified to teach;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.3'>not addicted to wine, not quarrelsome; but gentle, not contentious, no lover of money;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.4'>one who manages well his own house, having his children in subjection with all seriousness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.5'>if a man does not know how to rule his own house, how will he take care of the congregation of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.6'>He should not be a new believer, so that he will not become conceited and fall into the condemnation of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.7'>He must have a good reputation with those outside the congregation, so that he will not fall into reproach and the snare of the Devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.8'>Ministerial servants should likewise be men of dignity, not double-tongued, or addicted to much wine or fond of sordid gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.9'>They should maintain the secret of the faith with a clear conscience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.10'>Let these be tested first. Then let them serve as servants, if they are blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.11'>Women in like manner must be serious, not slanderers, temperate, faithful in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.12'>Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.13'>For they that have served well as servants gain to themselves a good standing and great confidence boldness of speech in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.14'>I write these things to you, hoping to come to you shortly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.15'>though if I am delayed, so that you may know how men ought to behave themselves in the household of God, which is the congregation of the living God, the pillar and support of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.3.16'>The secret of godliness is great and it is without controversy. He Jesus Christ was manifested revealed in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, and seen by angels. He preached among the nations, was believed on in the world, and received up in glory.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.1'>The Spirit explicitly says that some will fall away from the faith truth in later times. Spirits and doctrines of demons will seduce them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.2'>through the hypocrisy of men that speak lies, branded in their own conscience as with a hot iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.3'>They will forbid marrying, and command to abstain from food, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.4'>For every creature of God is good, and nothing is to be rejected, if it is received with thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.5'>This is because it is sanctified through the word of God and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.6'>If you tell the brothers about these things, you will be a good minister of Christ Jesus, nourished in the words of the faith, and of the good doctrine which you have followed until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.7'>Refuse false stories and old wives' fables. Train yourself with godliness in mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.8'>Bodily exercise is profitable for a little. However, godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is and of the life that is to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.9'>Faithful and worthy of full acceptance is the statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.10'>This is why we labor and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of those who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.11'>Command and teach these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.12'>Let no man look down on your youth. Be an example to the believers in speech and conduct, in love, in faith and chasteness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.13'>Till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.14'>Do not neglect the spiritual gift in you. It was given to you by prophecy, with the laying on of the hands of the elders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.15'>Be diligent and think about these things. Give yourself wholly to them. That way your progress may be apparent to all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.4.16'>Pay attention to yourself and to your teaching. Continue in these things. When you do this you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.1'>Do not rebuke censurecriticize an elder, but appeal to him as a father, the younger men as brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.2'>Treat the elder women as mothers, the younger as sisters, with much honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.3'>Honor widows that are truly widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.4'>But if any widow has children or grandchildren, let them learn first to show righteousness towards their own family, and to repay their parents: for this is acceptable in the sight of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.5'>Now she that is a widow indeed, and desolate, has her hope set on God, and continues in supplications and prayers day and night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.6'>But she that gives herself to pleasure is dead while she lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.7'>Command these things that they may be without reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.8'>If any do not provide for his own, and specially his own household, he denies the faith, and is worse than an unbeliever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.9'>Let a widow be put on the list if she is under sixty years old, having been the wife of one man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.10'>having a good reputation for good works, if she has brought up children, if she has been hospitable to strangers, if she has washed the feet of the holy ones, if she has relieved the afflicted, if she has diligently followed every good work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.11'>Refuse younger widows: for when their sexual impulses come between them and Christ, they desire to marry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.12'>They have judgment, because they have rejected their first pledge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.13'>They also learn to be idle, going about from house to house; and not only idle, but gossipers and busybodies, speaking things that they should not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.14'>I desire therefore that the younger widows marry, bear children, rule the household, and give no occasion to the adversary for reviling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.15'>Some have already turned aside after Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.16'>If any woman that believes has dependant widows, she must assist them and not let the congregation be burdened. Then it can assist those who are actually widows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.17'>Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in the word and in teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.18'>For the scripture said: »You must not muzzle the bull while he is threshing. The workman is worthy of his wages.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.19'>Do not offer an accusation against an elder, except at the mouth of two or three witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.20'>Reprove the sinner in the sight of all, that the rest also may be in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.21'>I charge you in the sight of God, and Christ Jesus, and the chosen angels, that you observe these principles without prejudice, doing nothing by partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.22'>Do not lay your hands hastily on any man, neither be a partaker of other men's sins: keep yourself pure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.23'>Do not drink water any longer, but use a little wine for your stomach's sake and your many infirmities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.24'>Some men's sins are known publicly, leading to judgment; and some mens sin becomes known later.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.5.25'>In like manner some good works are known publicly, and other works will be known, for they cannot be kept hidden.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Tim.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.1'>Let as many as are servants under the yoke count their own masters worthy of all honor, that the name of God and the teachings will not be blasphemed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.2'>Do not despise your believing masters, because they are brothers. Serve them, because they who partake of the benefit are believing and beloved. Teach and exhort these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.3'>If any man teaches a different doctrine, and does not consent to sound words, even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine that is according to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.4'>he is proud, knows nothing, has a morbid interest in questions and disputes about words, which leads to envy, strife, abusive language, evil suspicions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.5'>frictions between men corrupted in mind and lacking in truth, supposing that godliness is a way of gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.6'>Godliness with contentment is great gain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.7'>We brought nothing into the world and we can carry nothing out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.8'>We should be content with having food and covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.9'>Those who are determined to be rich fall into a temptation and a snare and many foolish and hurtful lusts. These draw men into ruin and destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.10'>For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some by longing for it have been led away from the faith. They have pierced themselves through with many sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.11'>But you, O man of God, run from these things. Pursue set your heart on righteousness, godliness, faith, love, patience and meekness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.12'>Fight the good fight of the faith! Lay hold on everlasting life! You were called and confessed the good confession in the sight of many witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.13'>I charge you in the sight of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who before Pontius Pilate witnessed the good confession:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.14'>Keep the commandment without spot and without reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.15'>The blessed and only Potentate SovereignAuthority will make him appear in his own appointed time. For he is the King of kings and Lord of lords.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.16'>Only God has immortality, dwelling in unapproachable light. No man has seen him, nor can see him. To him be honor and power forever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.17'>Command those who are rich in this present system not to be high-minded arrogant, not to have their hope set on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who gives us richly all things to enjoy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.18'>They should do good works and be rich in good works, that they are ready to distribute, willing to communicate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.19'>They store up for them a good foundation for the time to come, that they may lay hold on the life that is life indeed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.20'>O Timothy, guard that which is committed to you. Turn away from the empty speeches that violate what is holy and from opposition and from false »knowledge.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Tim.6.21'>Some have professed this knowledge and erred concerning the faith. Grace be with you.</verse>
