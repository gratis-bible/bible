        <title>(Writer: Hosea means Saved by Jah) (After 745 B.C.E.) (Samaria)</title>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.1'>The word of Jehovah that came to Hosea the son of Beeri, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.2'>When Jehovah first spoke through Hosea, Jehovah said to Hosea, »Go and marry an adulterous wife and have children with her for the land commits flagrant adultery. They have abandoned Jehovah.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.3'>So he took as his wife Gomer the daughter of Diblaim. She conceived, and gave birth to a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.4'>Jehovah said to Hosea: »Name him Jezreel. In a little while I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the house of Jehu. I will cause the kingdom of Israel to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.5'>»It will happen that I will break the bow strength of Israel in the valley of Jezrell.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.6'>Gomer conceived again, and gave birth to a daughter. Jehovah said to Hosea: »Name her Loruhamah for I will no longer have mercy upon the house of Israel and I will not pardon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.7'>»However I will have mercy compassionlove on the house of Judah. I will not save them by bow, or by sword. I will not save them by battle, not by horses, nor by horsemen. However, I will save them by Jehovah their God.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.8'>Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, Gomer conceived, and gave birth to another son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.9'>Jehovah said: »Name him Loammi for you are not my people, and I am not your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.10'>»Yet the number of the children of Israel will be like the grains of the sand of the sea, which cannot be measured or numbered. It will be said: You are the sons of the living God in the place where it was said you are not my people!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.1.11'>»The children of Judah and the children of Israel will be gathered together. They will appoint for themselves one leader, and will leave the land of Jezreel. It will be a great day for Jezreel.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.1'>»Say to your brothers: My people. Say to your sisters: You have been shown loving kindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.2'>»Plead with your mother your nation, for she is not my wife, neither am I her husband. Let her put away her acts of adultery from her face, and her adulteries from between her breasts!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.3'>»I will strip her naked and make her as in the day that she was born. I will make her as a wilderness, and make her like a dry land, and kill her with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.4'>»I will show no mercy to her children for they are children of fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.5'>Their mother played the harlot. She that conceived them acted shamefully! For she said, I will go after my lovers, who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.6'>»Behold, I Jehovah will fence her way with thorns. I will build a wall against her that she will not find her path.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.7'>»She will follow after her lovers but she will not reach them. She will seek them, but will not find them! She will say: I will return to my first husband for it was better for me then.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.8'>»She did not know that I gave her the grain, the new wine and oil, and multiplied her silver and gold, which they used for Baal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.9'>»Therefore I will take back my grain at that time, and my new wine in the season. I will pluck away my wool and my flax that should have covered her nakedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.10'>»Now I will uncover her lewdness obscene behavior in the sight of her lovers, and none will deliver her out of my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.11'>»I will also cause all her exaltation to cease, her feasts, her new moons, and her Sabbaths, and all her solemn assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.12'>»I will lay waste her vines and her fig trees. Of this she said: These are my loose womans hire that my lovers have given me. I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field will eat them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.13'>»I will punish her for the days in which she burned incense to the Baals, when she decked herself with her earrings and her jewels, and went after her lovers, and forgot me,« said Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.14'>»Therefore, behold, I will entice her into the wilderness, and speak kindly to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.15'>»I will give her vineyards from there and the valley of Achor for a door of hope. She will sing there as in the days of her youth and in the day when she came up out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.16'>»It will be at that day,« said Jehovah; »you will call me husband Ishi. You will no longer call me my master baali.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.17'>»For I will take away the names of the Baals out of her mouth, and they will no more be mentioned by their name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.18'>»At that time I will make a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the birds of the heavens, and with the creeping things of the ground. I will break the bow and the sword and the battle out of the land, and will make them lie down in safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.19'>»I will engage you to me for a very long time! Yes I will engage you to me in righteousness, and in justice, and in loving kindness, and in mercies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.20'>»I will even engage you to me in faithfulness. Then you will know Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.21'>»It will happen in that day. I will answer,« said Jehovah, »I will answer the heavens, and they will answer the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.22'>»The earth will answer the grain, and the new wine, and the oil; and they will answer Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.2.23'>»And I will sow her to me in the earth! I will have mercy compassion on her who had not obtained mercy. I will say to those who were not my people: You are my people! They will answer: You are my God!«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.3'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.1'>Jehovah said to me: »Go again and love a woman beloved by her friend. Love an adulteress, even as Jehovah loves the children of Israel. Though they turn to other gods, and love cakes of raisins for feasts.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.2'>So I bought her for fifteen pieces of silver, and a homer of barley, and a half-homer of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.3'>I said to her: »You will live with me many days. You must not play the harlot commit fornication and you must not be any mans wife. I will also be with you.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.4'>For the children of Israel will live many days without king, without prince, without sacrifice, without pillar, and without ephod or teraphim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.3.5'>Afterward the children of Israel will return and seek Jehovah their God. David their king will come with trembling to Jehovah and to his goodness in the last days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.4'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.1'>Hear the word of Jehovah, you children of Israel! For Jehovah has a legal case against the inhabitants of the land. There is no truth! There is no goodness. There is no knowledge of God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.2'>They do nothing but swear, deceive, kill, steal and commit adultery! There is violence and bloodshed in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.3'>Therefore the land will mourn. All the inhabitants are weak. The beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens and the fish of the sea will also perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.4'>Let no man find fault and let no man reprove. After all your people are the ones who debate argue with a priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.5'>You will stumble in the day, and the prophet will stumble with you in the night. I will destroy your mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.6'>My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge. Because you have rejected knowledge, I will also reject you! You will not be a priest to me since you have forgotten the Law of your God. Therefore, I will forget your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.7'>They grew in number and sinned against me. I will change their glory into shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.8'>They feed on the sins of my people, and set their heart on their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.9'>It will be like people, like the priests. I will punish them for their ways, and will repay them for their actions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.10'>They will eat, and not have enough! They will play the harlot, and will not increase! They do not listen to Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.11'>Prostitution, wine and new wine take away the understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.12'>My people ask counsel at their stock, and their staff declares to them; for the spirit of adultery caused them to go astray. They have played the harlot, departing from their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.13'>They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains! They burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars storax and the strong tree, because it has good shade. Your daughters play the harlot, and your brides commit adultery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.14'>I will not punish your daughters when they play the harlot, nor your brides when they commit adultery. The men go out with harlots, and they sacrifice with the prostitutes. The people that do not understand will fall be overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.15'>Though you, Israel, play the harlot, do not let Judah become guilty! Do not go to Gilgal, neither go to Bethaven, nor swear, »As Jehovah lives.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.16'>For Israel behaved stubbornly like a stubborn heifer. Will Jehovah now feed them as a lamb in a large place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.17'>Ephraim is joined to idols. Leave him alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.18'>Their drink wheat beer has become sour. They play the harlot continually. Her rulers dearly love shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.4.19'>The wind wrapped her up in its wings. They will be put to shame because of their sacrifices!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.5'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.1'>»Hear this, O you priests and pay attention, O house of Israel. Give ear listen! O house of the king the judgment is about you. You have been a snare at Mizpah and a net spread upon Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.2'>»The rebels are eager to kill. I will correct them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.3'>»I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me. O Ephraim, you have played the harlot and Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.4'>»They will not consecrate their deeds to their God because the spirit of fornication is in them. They do not know Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.5'>»The pride of Israel testifies about them. Therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity. Judah will also stumble with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.6'>»They will go with their flocks and with their herds to seek Jehovah. But they will not find him. He has withdrawn from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.7'>»They have dealt treacherously against Jehovah! They have borne strange children: now the new moon will devour them with their fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.8'>»Blow the horn in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: sound an alarm at Bethaven behind you, O Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.9'>»Ephraim will become desolation in the day of rebuke among the tribes of Israel. I made known that which will surely be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.10'>»The princes of Judah are like them that remove the landmark. I will pour my wrath upon them like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.11'>»Ephraim is oppressed. He is crushed in judgment because he was content to walk after man's command.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.12'>»I am like a moth to Ephraim and to the house of Judah as rottenness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.13'>»When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, Ephraim went to Assyria and sent to King Jareb. He is not able to heal you, neither will he cure you of your wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.14'>»For I will be to Ephraim as a lion. And I will be like a young lion to the house of Judah. I, even I, will tear and go away. I will carry off and there will be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.5.15'>»I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek me. They will seek me earnestly in their affliction.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.6'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.1'>»Come, and let us return to Jehovah. He has torn us to pieces but he will heal us. He has wounded us but he will bandage us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.2'>»He will revive us after two days. He will raise us up on the third day that we will live before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.3'>»Let us get to know Jehovah! Let us press on run afterfollow to get to know him. As surely as the sun rises he will appear. He will come to us like the winter rains, like the spring rains that water the earth.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.4'>»What can I do with you, Ephraim? What can I do with you, Judah? Your love is like the morning mist, like the early dew that disappears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.5'>»Therefore I cut you in pieces by my prophets. I have killed you with the words of my mouth. My judgments flashed like lightning upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.6'>»I desire loving-kindness mercy, not sacrifice, and knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.7'>»Like Adam, they have broken the covenant. They were unfaithful to me there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.8'>»Gilead is a city of wicked men, stained with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.9'>»As marauders lie in ambush for a man, so do bands of priests. They murder on the road to Shechem, committing shameful crimes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.10'>»I have seen a horrible thing in the house of Israel. There Ephraim is given to prostitution and Israel is defiled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.6.11'>»Also for you, O Judah, a harvest is appointed.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.7'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.1'>»When I want to heal my people Israel and make them prosperous again, all I can see is their wickedness and the evil deeds of Samaria. They cheat one another. They break into houses and steal. They actually rob people in the streets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.2'>»It never enters their hearts that I will remember all this evil. But their sins surround them, and I cannot avoid seeing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.3'>»They make kings happy with the wicked things they do. They make officials happy with the lies they tell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.4'>»They all commit adultery. They are like a heated oven, an oven so hot that a baker does not have to fan its flames when he makes bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.5'>»On the day of the king's celebration, the officials become drunk from the heat of wine, and the king joins mockers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.6'>»They become hot inside like an oven while they lie in ambush. All night long their anger smolders, but in the morning it burns like a raging fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.7'>»They are all as hot as an oven. They consume their rulers like a fire. All their kings die in battle, and none of them calls to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.8'>»Ephraim mixes with other nations. Ephraim, you are like a half-baked loaf of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.9'>»Foreigners are using up your strength, but you do not realize it. You have become a gray-haired, old man, but you do not realize it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.10'>»Israel, your arrogance testifies against you. Even after all this, you do not return to Jehovah your God or look to him for help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.11'>»Ephraim, you are like a simpleminded, senseless dove. You call to Egypt and run to Assyria for help.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.12'>»When you go, I will spread my net over you. I will snatch you out of the air like a bird. I will punish you for all the evil things you have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.13'>»Woe to them, for they have strayed from me! Destruction is theirs, for they have rebelled against me! I would redeem them, but they speak lies against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.14'>»And they do not cry to me from their heart when they wail on their beds. For the sake of grain and new wine they assemble, but they turn away from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.15'>»Although I trained disciplined and strengthened their arms mightpower, yet they devise evil against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.7.16'>»They do not turn upward to God. They are like a loose bow. Their princes will fall by the sword because of the insolence of their tongue. This will be their derision in the land of Egypt.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.8'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.1'>»Sound the alarm on the trumpet. The enemy swoops down on Jehovahs Temple like an eagle. The people of Israel have rejected my covenant promise and rebelled against my Law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.2'>»Israel cries out to me: We know you as our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.3'>»However, they have rejected what is good. The enemy will pursue them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.4'>»They chose their own kings. I did not approve. They chose their own princes. Princes I did not know. They made idols with their own silver and gold. Because of this, they will be destroyed!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.5'>»Get rid of your calf-shaped idol, Samaria. My anger burns against these people! How long will they remain unclean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.6'>»Samaria's calf-shaped idol was made in Israel. Skilled workers made it. It is not God. It will be smashed to pieces!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.7'>»The people of Israel plant the wind, but they harvest a storm. A field of grain that does not ripen will never produce any grain. Even if it did produce grain, foreigners would eat it all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.8'>»Israel is swallowed up. It has already mixed in with the other nations. It has become worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.9'>The people of Israel went to Assyria. They were like wild donkeys wandering off alone. The people of Ephraim sold themselves to their lovers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.10'>»Even though they sold themselves among the nations, I will gather them now. They will suffer for a while under the burdens of kings and princes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.11'>»The more altars that the people of Ephraim build to make offerings to pay for their sins, the more places they have for sinning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.12'>»I have written many rules for them in my Law, but they consider these things strange and foreign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.13'>»They offer sacrifices to me and eat the meat of sacrifices, but I, Jehovah, do not accept these sacrifices. Now I will remember their wickedness and punish them because of their sins. They will go back to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.8.14'>»The people of Israel have built palaces, and they have forgotten their maker. The people of Judah have built many fortified cities. I will send a fire on their cities and burn down their palaces.«</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Hos.9'>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.1'>»O Israel, do not rejoice. Do not celebrate as pagan nations do. You have been unfaithful to your God. You have sold sex on every threshing floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.2'>»There will not be enough grain to feed people. There will not be enough wine to go around.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.3'>»The people of Ephraim will not stay in Jehovahs land. They will return to Egypt and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.4'>»They will not pour wine offerings to Jehovah. Their food will only satisfy their hunger. All who eat it will be defiled. It will not be brought as an offering to Jehovahs Temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.5'>»What will they do on the day of an appointed festival or on Jehovahs festival days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.6'>»Even if they escape without being destroyed, Egypt will capture them and Memphis will bury them. Weeds will grow over their silver treasures. Thorns will grow over their tents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.7'>The time for them to be punished will come. The time for them to pay for their sins will come. When this happens, Israel will know it. They think that prophets are fools and that spiritual people are crazy. They have sinned a lot, and are filled with hostility.«</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hos.9.8'>Prophets are Gods watchmen over Ephraim. Yet, traps are set on every prophets path and people are hostile in the Temple of their God.</verse>
