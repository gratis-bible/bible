I cry out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>Why dost thou show me iniquity, and look upon perverseness? for destruction and violence are before me; and there is strife, and contention riseth up.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>Therefore the law is slacked, and justice doth never go forth; for the wicked doth compass about the righteous; therefore justice goeth forth perverted.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>Behold ye among the nations, and look, and wonder marvellously; for I am working a work in your days, which ye will not believe though it be told you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty nation, that march through the breadth of the earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>They are terrible and dreadful; their judgment and their dignity proceed from themselves.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>Their horses also are swifter than leopards, and are more fierce than the evening wolves; and their horsemen press proudly on: yea, their horsemen come from far; they fly as an eagle that hasteth to devour.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>They come all of them for violence; the set of their faces is forwards; and they gather captives as the sand.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a derision unto him; he derideth every stronghold; for he heapeth up dust, and taketh it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>Then shall he sweep by [as] a wind, and shall pass over, and be guilty, [even] he whose might is his god.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Art not thou from everlasting, O Jehovah my God, my Holy One? we shall not die.
