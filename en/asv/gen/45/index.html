And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="2">2</a>And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="3">3</a>And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his presence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="4">4</a>And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and there are yet five years, in which there shall be neither plowing nor harvest.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to save you alive by a great deliverance.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children`s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet five years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye have seen: and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And he fell upon his brother Benjamin`s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon his neck.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and after that his brethren talked with him.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And the report thereof was heard in Pharaoh`s house, saying, Joseph`s brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and his servants.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do ye: lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>and take your father and your households, and come unto me: and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye shall eat the fat of the land.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>Now thou art commanded, this do ye: take you wagons out of the land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and bring your father, and come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of Egypt is yours.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And the sons of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them provision for the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five changes of raiment.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And to his father he sent after this manner: ten asses laden with the good things of Egypt, and ten she-asses laden with grain and bread and provision for his father by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob their father.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And they told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is ruler over all the land of Egypt. And his heart fainted, for he believed them not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>and Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I will go and see him before I die.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
