      <chapter osisID='Neh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.1'>The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.2'>that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.3'>And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.4'>And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.5'>and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.6'>Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father`s house have sinned:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.7'>we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.8'>Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.9'>but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.10'>Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.1.11'>O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.1'>And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been [beforetime] sad in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.2'>And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.3'>And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers` sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.4'>Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.5'>And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers` sepulchres, that I may build it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.6'>And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.7'>Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.8'>and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king`s forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.9'>Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king`s letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.10'>And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.11'>So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.12'>And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.13'>And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal`s well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.14'>Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king`s pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.15'>Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.16'>And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.17'>Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.18'>And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king`s words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good [work].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.19'>But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.2.20'>Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.1'>Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.2'>And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.3.14'>And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.15'>And the fountain gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king`s garden, even unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.3.16'>After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.1'>But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.2'>And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.3'>Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.4'>Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.5'>and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.6'>So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half [the height] thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.7'>But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.8'>and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.9'>But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.10'>And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.11'>And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.12'>And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.13'>Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.14'>And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.15'>And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.16'>And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.17'>They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.18'>and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.19'>And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.20'>in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.21'>So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.22'>Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.4.23'>So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one [went with] his weapon [to] the water.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.1'>Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.2'>For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.3'>Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.4'>There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king`s tribute [upon] our fields and our vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.5'>Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.6'>And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.7'>Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.8'>And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.9'>Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.10'>And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.11'>Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.12'>Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.13'>Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.14'>Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.15'>But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.16'>Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.17'>Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.18'>Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.5.19'>Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Neh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.1'>Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.2'>that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.3'>And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.4'>And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.5'>Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.6'>wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.7'>And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.8'>Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.9'>For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, [O God], strengthen thou my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.10'>And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.11'>And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.12'>And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.13'>For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.14'>Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.15'>So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.16'>And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard [thereof], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.17'>Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.18'>For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.6.19'>Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.7.1'>Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Neh.13.13'>And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.14'>Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.15'>In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses [therewith]; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.16'>There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.17'>Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.18'>Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.19'>And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.20'>So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.21'>Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.22'>And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.23'>In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.24'>and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews` language, but according to the language of each people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.25'>And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.26'>Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.27'>Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.28'>And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.29'>Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.30'>Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Neh.13.31'>and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.</verse>
