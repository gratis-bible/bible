Wherefore Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to Jerusalem.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="5">5</a>And Joab gave up the sum of the numbering of the people unto David. And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and a hundred thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="6">6</a>But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them; for the king`s word was abominable to Joab.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="7">7</a>And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="8">8</a>And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, in that I have done this thing: but now, put away, I beseech thee, the iniquity of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="9">9</a>And Jehovah spake unto Gad, David`s seer, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>Go and speak unto David, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, I offer thee three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto thee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith Jehovah, Take which thou wilt:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>either three years of famine; or three months to be consumed before thy foes, while the sword of thine enemies overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of Jehovah, even pestilence in the land, and the angel of Jehovah destroying throughout all the borders of Israel. Now therefore consider what answer I shall return to him that sent me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall, I pray, into the hand of Jehovah; for very great are his mercies: and let me not fall into the hand of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>So Jehovah sent a pestilence upon Israel; and there fell of Israel seventy thousand men.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he was about to destroy, Jehovah beheld, and he repented him of the evil, and said to the destroying angel, It is enough; now stay thy hand. And the angel of Jehovah was standing by the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of Jehovah standing between earth and heaven, having a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell upon their faces.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done very wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? let thy hand, I pray thee, O Jehovah my God, be against me, and against my father`s house; but not against thy people, that they should be plagued.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then the angel of Jehovah commanded Gad to say to David, that David should go up, and rear an altar unto Jehovah in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the name of Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons that were with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and went out of the threshing-floor, and bowed himself to David with his face to the ground.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then David said to Ornan, Give me the place of this threshing-floor, that I may build thereon an altar unto Jehovah: for the full price shalt thou give it me, that the plague may be stayed from the people.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give [thee] the oxen for burnt-offerings, and the threshing instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meal-offering; I give it all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine for Jehovah, nor offer a burnt-offering without cost.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of gold by weight.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And David built there an altar unto Jehovah, and offered burnt-offerings and peace-offerings, and called upon Jehovah; and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of burnt-offering.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>And Jehovah commanded the angel; and he put up his sword again into the sheath thereof.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>At that time, when David saw that Jehovah had answered him in the threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed there.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>For the tabernacle of Jehovah, which Moses made in the wilderness, and the altar of burnt-offering, were at that time in the high place at Gibeon.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>But David could not go before it to inquire of God; for he was afraid because of the sword of the angel of Jehovah.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
