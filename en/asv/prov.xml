        <verse osisID='Prov.1.1'>The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.2'>To know wisdom and instruction; To discern the words of understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.3'>To receive instruction in wise dealing, In righteousness and justice and equity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.4'>To give prudence to the simple, To the young man knowledge and discretion:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.5'>That the wise man may hear, and increase in learning; And that the man of understanding may attain unto sound counsels:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.6'>To understand a proverb, and a figure, The words of the wise, and their dark sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.7'>The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge; [But] the foolish despise wisdom and instruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.8'>My son, hear the instruction of thy father, And forsake not the law of thy mother:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.9'>For they shall be a chaplet of grace unto thy head, And chains about thy neck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.10'>My son, if sinners entice thee, Consent thou not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.11'>If they say, Come with us, Let us lay wait for blood; Let us lurk privily for the innocent without cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.12'>Let us swallow them up alive as Sheol, And whole, as those that go down into the pit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.13'>We shall find all precious substance; We shall fill our houses with spoil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.14'>Thou shalt cast thy lot among us; We will all have one purse:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.15'>My son, walk not thou in the way with them; Refrain thy foot from their path:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.16'>For their feet run to evil, And they make haste to shed blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.17'>For in vain is the net spread In the sight of any bird:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.18'>And these lay wait for their own blood; They lurk privily for their own lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.19'>So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; It taketh away the life of the owners thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.20'>Wisdom crieth aloud in the street; She uttereth her voice in the broad places;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.21'>She crieth in the chief place of concourse; At the entrance of the gates, In the city, she uttereth her words:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.22'>How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? And scoffers delight them in scoffing, And fools hate knowledge?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.23'>Turn you at my reproof: Behold, I will pour out my spirit upon you; I will make known my words unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.24'>Because I have called, and ye have refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man hath regarded;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.25'>But ye have set at nought all my counsel, And would none of my reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.26'>I also will laugh in [the day of] your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.27'>When your fear cometh as a storm, And your calamity cometh on as a whirlwind; When distress and anguish come upon you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.28'>Then will they call upon me, but I will not answer; They will seek me diligently, but they shall not find me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.29'>For that they hated knowledge, And did not choose the fear of Jehovah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.30'>They would none of my counsel; They despised all my reproof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.31'>Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, And be filled with their own devices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.32'>For the backsliding of the simple shall slay them, And the careless ease of fools shall destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.1.33'>But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell securely, And shall be quiet without fear of evil.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.3'>Yea, if thou cry after discernment, And lift up thy voice for understanding;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.4'>If thou seek her as silver, And search for her as for hid treasures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.5'>Then shalt thou understand the fear of Jehovah, And find the knowledge of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.6'>For Jehovah giveth wisdom; Out of his mouth [cometh] knowledge and understanding:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.8'>That he may guard the paths of justice, And preserve the way of his saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.9'>Then shalt thou understand righteousness and justice, And equity, [yea], every good path.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.2.11'>Discretion shall watch over thee; Understanding shall keep thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.12'>To deliver thee from the way of evil, From the men that speak perverse things;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.13'>Who forsake the paths of uprightness, To walk in the ways of darkness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.14'>Who rejoice to do evil, And delight in the perverseness of evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.15'>Who are crooked in their ways, And wayward in their paths:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.16'>To deliver thee from the strange woman, Even from the foreigner that flattereth with her words;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.17'>That forsaketh the friend of her youth, And forgetteth the covenant of her God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.18'>For her house inclineth unto death, And her paths unto the dead;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.19'>None that go unto her return again, Neither do they attain unto the paths of life:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.20'>That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, And keep the paths of the righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.21'>For the upright shall dwell in the land, And the perfect shall remain in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.2.22'>But the wicked shall be cut off from the land, And the treacherous shall be rooted out of it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.3.3'>Let not kindness and truth forsake thee: Bind them about thy neck; Write them upon the tablet of thy heart:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.4'>So shalt thou find favor and good understanding In the sight of God and man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.5'>Trust in Jehovah with all thy heart, And lean not upon thine own understanding:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.6'>In all thy ways acknowledge him, And he will direct thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.7'>Be not wise in thine own eyes; Fear Jehovah, and depart from evil:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.8'>It will be health to thy navel, And marrow to thy bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.9'>Honor Jehovah with thy substance, And with the first-fruits of all thine increase:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.10'>So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, And thy vats shall overflow with new wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.11'>My son, despise not the chastening of Jehovah; Neither be weary of his reproof:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.12'>For whom Jehovah loveth he reproveth; Even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.13'>Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, And the man that getteth understanding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.14'>For the gaining of it is better than the gaining of       silver, And the profit thereof than fine gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.15'>She is more precious than rubies: And none of the things thou canst desire are to be compared unto       her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.16'>Length of days is in her right hand; In her left hand are riches and honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.17'>Her ways are ways of pleasantness, And all her paths are peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.18'>She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: And happy is every one that retaineth her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.19'>Jehovah by wisdom founded the earth; By understanding he established the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.3.20'>By his knowledge the depths were broken up, And the skies drop down the dew.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.2'>For I give you good doctrine; Forsake ye not my law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Prov.4.3'>For I was a son unto my father, Tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Prov.4.15'>Avoid it, pass not by it; Turn from it, and pass on.</verse>
