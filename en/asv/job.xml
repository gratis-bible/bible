      <chapter osisID='Job.1'>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.1'>There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and turned away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.2'>And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.3'>His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five hundred she-asses, and a very great household; so that this man was the greatest of all the children of the east.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.4'>And his sons went and held a feast in the house of each one upon his day; and they sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.5'>And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in the morning, and offered burnt-offerings according to the number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have sinned, and renounced God in their hearts. Thus did Job continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.6'>Now it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan also came among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.7'>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.8'>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.9'>Then Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Doth Job fear God for nought?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.10'>Hast not thou made a hedge about him, and about his house, and about all that he hath, on every side? thou hast blessed the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.11'>But put forth thy hand now, and touch all that he hath, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.12'>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in thy power; only upon himself put not forth thy hand. So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.13'>And it fell on a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.14'>that there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were plowing, and the asses feeding beside them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.15'>and the Sabeans fell [upon them], and took them away: yea, they have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.16'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the sheep and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.17'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, The Chaldeans made three bands, and fell upon the camels, and have taken them away, yea, and slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.18'>While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said, Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother`s house;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.19'>and, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to tell thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.20'>Then Job arose, and rent his robe, and shaved his head, and fell down upon the ground, and worshipped;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.21'>and he said, Naked came I out of my mother`s womb, and naked shall I return thither: Jehovah gave, and Jehovah hath taken away; blessed be the name of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.1.22'>In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.2'>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.1'>Again it came to pass on the day when the sons of God came to present themselves before Jehovah, that Satan came also among them to present himself before Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.2'>And Jehovah said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, From going to and fro in the earth, and from walking up and down in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.3'>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant Job? for there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and an upright man, one that feareth God, and turneth away from evil: and he still holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.4'>And Satan answered Jehovah, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all that a man hath will he give for his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.5'>But put forth thy hand now, and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will renounce thee to thy face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.6'>And Jehovah said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thy hand; only spare his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.7'>So Satan went forth from the presence of Jehovah, and smote Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.8'>And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself therewith; and he sat among the ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.9'>Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still hold fast thine integrity? renounce God, and die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.10'>But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job sin with his lips.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.11'>Now when Job`s three friends heard of all this evil that was come upon him, they came every one from his own place: Eliphaz the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite, and they made an appointment together to come to bemoan him and to comfort him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.12'>And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not, they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one his robe, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.2.13'>So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his grief was very great.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.3'>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.1'>After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.2'>And Job answered and said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.3'>Let the day perish wherein I was born, And the night which said, There is a man-child conceived.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.4'>Let that day be darkness; Let not God from above seek for it, Neither let the light shine upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.5'>Let darkness and the shadow of death claim it for their       own; Let a cloud dwell upon it; Let all that maketh black the day terrify it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.6'>As for that night, let thick darkness seize upon it: Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; Let it not come into the number of the months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.7'>Lo, let that night be barren; Let no joyful voice come therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.8'>Let them curse it that curse the day, Who are ready to rouse up leviathan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.9'>Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark: Let it look for light, but have none; Neither let it behold the eyelids of the morning:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.10'>Because it shut not up the doors of my [mother`s] womb, Nor hid trouble from mine eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.11'>Why died I not from the womb? Why did I not give up the ghost when my mother bare me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.12'>Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breast, that I should suck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.13'>For now should I have lain down and been quiet; I should have slept; then had I been at rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.14'>With kings and counsellors of the earth, Who built up waste places for themselves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.15'>Or with princes that had gold, Who filled their houses with silver:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.16'>Or as a hidden untimely birth I had not been, As infants that never saw light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.17'>There the wicked cease from troubling; And there the weary are at rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.18'>There the prisoners are at ease together; They hear not the voice of the taskmaster.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.19'>The small and the great are there: And the servant is free from his master.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.20'>Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, And life unto the bitter in soul;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.21'>Who long for death, but it cometh not, And dig for it more than for hid treasures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.22'>Who rejoice exceedingly, And are glad, when they can find the grave?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.23'>[Why is light given] to a man whose way is hid, And whom God hath hedged in?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.24'>For my sighing cometh before I eat, And my groanings are poured out like water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.25'>For the thing which I fear cometh upon me, And that which I am afraid of cometh unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.3.26'>I am not at ease, neither am I quiet, neither have I rest; But trouble cometh.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.4'>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.1'>Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.2'>If one assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? But who can withhold himself from speaking?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.3'>Behold, thou hast instructed many, And thou hast strengthened the weak hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.4'>Thy words have upholden him that was falling, And thou hast made firm the feeble knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.5'>But now it is come unto thee, and thou faintest; It toucheth thee, and thou art troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.6'>Is not thy fear [of God] thy confidence, [And] the integrity of thy ways thy hope?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.7'>Remember, I pray thee, who [ever] perished, being innocent? Or where were the upright cut off?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.8'>According as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, And sow trouble, reap the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.9'>By the breath of God they perish, And by the blast of his anger are they consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.10'>The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, And the teeth of the young lions, are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.11'>The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, And the whelps of the lioness are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.12'>Now a thing was secretly brought to me, And mine ear received a whisper thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.13'>In thoughts from the visions of the night, When deep sleep falleth on men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.14'>Fear came upon me, and trembling, Which made all my bones to shake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.15'>Then a spirit passed before my face; The hair of my flesh stood up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.16'>It stood still, but I could not discern the appearance       thereof; A form was before mine eyes: [There was] silence, and I heard a voice, [saying],</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.17'>Shall mortal man be more just than God? Shall a man be more pure than his Maker?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.18'>Behold, he putteth no trust in his servants; And his angels he chargeth with folly:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.19'>How much more them that dwell in houses of clay, Whose foundation is in the dust, Who are crushed before the moth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.20'>Betwixt morning and evening they are destroyed: They perish for ever without any regarding it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.4.21'>Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them? They die, and that without wisdom.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.5'>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.1'>Call now; is there any that will answer thee? And to which of the holy ones wilt thou turn?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.2'>For vexation killeth the foolish man, And jealousy slayeth the silly one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.3'>I have seen the foolish taking root: But suddenly I cursed his habitation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.4'>His children are far from safety, And they are crushed in the gate, Neither is there any to deliver them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.5'>Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, And taketh it even out of the thorns; And the snare gapeth for their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.6'>For affliction cometh not forth from the dust, Neither doth trouble spring out of the ground;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.7'>But man is born unto trouble, As the sparks fly upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.8'>But as for me, I would seek unto God, And unto God would I commit my cause;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.9'>Who doeth great things and unsearchable, Marvellous things without number:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.10'>Who giveth rain upon the earth, And sendeth waters upon the fields;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.11'>So that he setteth up on high those that are low, And those that mourn are exalted to safety.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.12'>He frustrateth the devices of the crafty, So that their hands cannot perform their enterprise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.13'>He taketh the wise in their own craftiness; And the counsel of the cunning is carried headlong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.14'>They meet with darkness in the day-time, And grope at noonday as in the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.15'>But he saveth from the sword of their mouth, Even the needy from the hand of the mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.16'>So the poor hath hope, And iniquity stoppeth her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.17'>Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: Therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.18'>For he maketh sore, and bindeth up; He woundeth, and his hands make whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.19'>He will deliver thee in six troubles; Yea, in seven there shall no evil touch thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.20'>In famine he will redeem thee from death; And in war from the power of the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.21'>Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue; Neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.22'>At destruction and dearth thou shalt laugh; Neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.23'>For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field; And the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.24'>And thou shalt know that thy tent is in peace; And thou shalt visit thy fold, and shalt miss nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.25'>Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, And thine offspring as the grass of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.26'>Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, Like as a shock of grain cometh in in its season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.5.27'>Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; Hear it, and know thou it for thy good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Job.6'>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.1'>Then Job answered and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.2'>Oh that my vexation were but weighed, And all my calamity laid in the balances!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.3'>For now it would be heavier than the sand of the seas: Therefore have my words been rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.4'>For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, The poison whereof my spirit drinketh up: The terrors of God do set themselves in array against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.5'>Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? Or loweth the ox over his fodder?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.6'>Can that which hath no savor be eaten without salt? Or is there any taste in the white of an egg?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.7'>My soul refuseth to touch [them]; They are as loathsome food to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.8'>Oh that I might have my request; And that God would grant [me] the thing that I long for!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.9'>Even that it would please God to crush me; That he would let loose his hand, and cut me off!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.10'>And be it still my consolation, Yea, let me exult in pain that spareth not, That I have not denied the words of the Holy One.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.11'>What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is mine end, that I should be patient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.12'>Is my strength the strength of stones? Or is my flesh of brass?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.13'>Is it not that I have no help in me, And that wisdom is driven quite from me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.14'>To him that is ready to faint kindness [should be showed]       from his friend; Even to him that forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.15'>My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, As the channel of brooks that pass away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.16'>Which are black by reason of the ice, [And] wherein the snow hideth itself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.17'>What time they wax warm, they vanish; When it is hot, they are consumed out of their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.18'>The caravans [that travel] by the way of them turn aside; They go up into the waste, and perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.19'>The caravans of Tema looked, The companies of Sheba waited for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.20'>They were put to shame because they had hoped; They came thither, and were confounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.21'>For now ye are nothing; Ye see a terror, and are afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.22'>Did I say, Give unto me? Or, Offer a present for me of your substance?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.23'>Or, Deliver me from the adversary`s hand? Or, Redeem me from the hand of the oppressors?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.24'>Teach me, and I will hold my peace; And cause me to understand wherein I have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.25'>How forcible are words of uprightness! But your reproof, what doth it reprove?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.26'>Do ye think to reprove words, Seeing that the speeches of one that is desperate are as wind?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.27'>Yea, ye would cast [lots] upon the fatherless, And make merchandise of your friend.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.28'>Now therefore be pleased to look upon me; For surely I shall not lie to your face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.29'>Return, I pray you, let there be no injustice; Yea, return again, my cause is righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.6.30'>Is there injustice on my tongue? Cannot my taste discern mischievous things?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.7.1'>Is there not a warfare to man upon earth? And are not his days like the days of a hireling?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.40.21'>He lieth under the lotus-trees, In the covert of the reed, and the fen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.22'>The lotus-trees cover him with their shade; The willows of the brook compass him about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.23'>Behold, if a river overflow, he trembleth not; He is confident, though a Jordan swell even to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.40.24'>Shall any take him when he is on the watch, Or pierce through his nose with a snare?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Job.41.3'>Will he make many supplications unto thee? Or will he speak soft words unto thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.41.4'>Will he make a covenant with thee, That thou shouldest take him for a servant for ever?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Job.42'>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.1'>Then Job answered Jehovah, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.2'>I know that thou canst do all things, And that no purpose of thine can be restrained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.3'>Who is this that hideth counsel without knowledge? Therefore have I uttered that which I understood not, Things too wonderful for me, which I knew not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.4'>Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak; I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.5'>I had heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; But now mine eye seeth thee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.6'>Wherefore I abhor [myself], And repent in dust and ashes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.7'>And it was so, that, after Jehovah had spoken these words unto Job, Jehovah said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is kindled against thee, and against thy two friends; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.8'>Now therefore, take unto you seven bullocks and seven rams, and go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt-offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you; for him will I accept, that I deal not with you after your folly; for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.9'>So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went, and did according as Jehovah commanded them: and Jehovah accepted Job.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.10'>And Jehovah turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends: and Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.11'>Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they bemoaned him, and comforted him concerning all the evil that Jehovah had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of money, and every one a ring of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.12'>So Jehovah blessed the latter end of Job more than his beginning: And he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand she-asses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.13'>He had also seven sons and three daughters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.14'>And he called the name of the first, Jemimah: and the name of the second, Keziah; and the name of the third, Keren-happuch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.15'>And in all the land were no women found so fair as the daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.16'>And after this Job lived a hundred and forty years, and saw his sons, and his sons` sons, [even] four generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Job.42.17'>So Job died, being old and full of days.                      Book I  Psalm 1</verse>
