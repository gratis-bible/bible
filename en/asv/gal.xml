  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paul, an apostle (not from men, neither through man, but through Jesus Christ, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren that are with me, unto the churches of Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace to you and peace from God the Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave himself for our sins, that he might deliver us out of this present evil world, according to the will of our God and Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom [be] the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I marvel that ye are so quickly removing from him that called you in the grace of Christ unto a different gospel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>which is not another [gospel] only there are some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But though we, or an angel from heaven, should preach unto you any gospel other than that which we preached unto you, let him be anathema.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As we have said before, so say I now again, if any man preacheth unto you any gospel other than that which ye received, let him be anathema.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For am I now seeking the favor of men, or of God? or am I striving to please men? if I were still pleasing men, I should not be a servant of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>For I make known to you, brethren, as touching the gospel which was preached by me, that it is not after man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>For neither did I receive it from man, nor was I taught it, but [it came to me] through revelation of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For ye have heard of my manner of life in time past in the Jews` religion, how that beyond measure I persecuted the church of God, and made havoc of it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>and I advanced in the Jews` religion beyond many of mine own age among my countrymen, being more exceedingly zealous for the traditions of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But when it was the good pleasure of God, who separated me, [even] from my mother`s womb, and called me through his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal his Son in me, that I might preach him among the Gentiles; straightway I conferred not with flesh and blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>neither went I up to Jerusalem to them that were apostles before me: but I went away into Arabia; and again I returned unto Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas, and tarried with him fifteen days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But other of the apostles saw I none, save James the Lord`s brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>Now touching the things which I write unto you, behold, before God, I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>Then I came unto the regions of Syria and Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>And I was still unknown by face unto the churches of Judaea which were in Christ:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>but they only heard say, He that once persecuted us now preacheth the faith of which he once made havoc;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>and they glorified God in me.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Then after the space of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus also with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>And I went up by revelation; and I laid before them the gospel which I preach among the Gentiles but privately before them who were of repute, lest by any means I should be running, or had run, in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>But not even Titus who was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>and that because of the false brethren privily brought in, who came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>to whom we gave place in the way of subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But from those who were reputed to be somewhat (whatsoever they were, it maketh no matter to me: God accepteth not man`s person)-- they, I say, who were of repute imparted nothing to me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but contrariwise, when they saw that I had been intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, even as Peter with [the gospel] of the circumcision</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>(for he that wrought for Peter unto the apostleship of the circumcision wrought for me also unto the Gentiles);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>and when they perceived the grace that was given unto me, James and Cephas and John, they who were reputed to be pillars, gave to me and Barnabas the right hands of fellowship, that we should go unto the Gentiles, and they unto the circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>only [they would] that we should remember the poor; which very thing I was also zealous to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Cephas came to Antioch, I resisted him to the face, because he stood condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For before that certain came from James, he ate with the Gentiles; but when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing them that were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the rest of the Jews dissembled likewise with him; insomuch that even Barnabas was carried away with their dissimulation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly according to the truth of the gospel, I said unto Cephas before [them] all, If thou, being a Jew, livest as do the Gentiles, and not as do the Jews, how compellest thou the Gentiles to live as do the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>We being Jews by nature, and not sinners of the Gentiles,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>yet knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, even we believed on Christ Jesus, that we might be justified by faith in Christ, and not by the works of the law: because by the works of the law shall no flesh be justified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>But if, while we sought to be justified in Christ, we ourselves also were found sinners, is Christ a minister of sin? God forbid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For if I build up again those things which I destroyed, I prove myself a transgressor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I through the law died unto the law, that I might live unto God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>I have been crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I that live, but Christ living in me: and that [life] which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, [the faith] which is in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not make void the grace of God: for if righteousness is through the law, then Christ died for nought.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O foolish Galatians, who did bewitch you, before whose eyes Jesus Christ was openly set forth crucified?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only would I learn from you. Received ye the Spirit by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are ye so foolish? having begun in the Spirit, are ye now perfected in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>Did ye suffer so many things in vain? if it be indeed in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>He therefore that supplieth to you the Spirit, and worketh miracles among you, [doeth he it] by the works of the law, or by the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>Even as Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned unto him for righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>Know therefore that they that are of faith, the same are sons of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>And the scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand unto Abraham, [saying,] In thee shall all the nations be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>So then they that are of faith are blessed with the faithful Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For as many as are of the works of the law are under a curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who continueth not in all things that are written in the book of the law, to do them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>Now that no man is justified by the law before God, is evident: for, The righteous shall live by faith;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>and the law is not of faith; but, He that doeth them shall live in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law, having become a curse for us; for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>that upon the Gentiles might come the blessing of Abraham in Christ Jesus; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>Brethren, I speak after the manner of men: Though it be but a man`s covenant, yet when it hath been confirmed, no one maketh it void, or addeth thereto.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>Now to Abraham were the promises spoken, and to his seed. He saith not, And to seeds, as of many; but as of one, And to thy seed, which is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>Now this I say: A covenant confirmed beforehand by God, the law, which came four hundred and thirty years after, doth not disannul, so as to make the promise of none effect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>For if the inheritance is of the law, it is no more of promise: but God hath granted it to Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>What then is the law? It was added because of transgressions, till the seed should come to whom the promise hath been made; [and it was] ordained through angels by the hand of a mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>Now a mediator is not [a mediator] of one; but God is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law then against the promises of God? God forbid: for if there had been a law given which could make alive, verily righteousness would have been of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scriptures shut up all things under sin, that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But before faith came, we were kept in ward under the law, shut up unto the faith which should afterwards be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>So that the law is become our tutor [to bring us] unto Christ, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But now faith that is come, we are no longer under a tutor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For ye are all sons of God, through faith, in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For as many of you as were baptized into Christ did put on Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>There can be neither Jew nor Greek, there can be neither bond nor free, there can be no male and female; for ye all are one [man] in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if ye are Christ`s, then are ye Abraham`s seed, heirs according to promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>But I say that so long as the heir is a child, he differeth nothing from a bondservant though he is lord of all;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under guardians and stewards until the day appointed of the father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So we also, when we were children, were held in bondage under the rudiments of the world:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>but when the fulness of the time came, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>that he might redeem them that were under the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because ye are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>So that thou art no longer a bondservant, but a son; and if a son, then an heir through God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>Howbeit at that time, not knowing God, ye were in bondage to them that by nature are no gods:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>but now that ye have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how turn ye back again to the weak and beggarly rudiments, whereunto ye desire to be in bondage over again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>Ye observe days, and months, and seasons, and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid of you, lest by any means I have bestowed labor upon you in vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>I beseech you, brethren, become as I [am], for I also [am become] as ye [are]. Ye did me no wrong:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>but ye know that because of an infirmity of the flesh I preached the gospel unto you the first time:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>and that which was a temptation to you in my flesh ye despised not, nor rejected; but ye received me as an angel of God, [even] as Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>Where then is that gratulation of yourselves? for I bear you witness, that, if possible, ye would have plucked out your eyes and given them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>So then am I become your enemy, by telling you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They zealously seek you in no good way; nay, they desire to shut you out, that ye may seek them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is good to be zealously sought in a good matter at all times, and not only when I am present with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My little children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ be formed in you--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>but I could wish to be present with you now, and to change my tone; for I am perplexed about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, ye that desire to be under the law, do ye not hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one by the handmaid, and one by the freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>Howbeit the [son] by the handmaid is born after the flesh; but the [son] by the freewoman [is born] through promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>Which things contain an allegory: for these [women] are two covenants; one from mount Sinai, bearing children unto bondage, which is Hagar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>Now this Hagar is mount Sinai in Arabia and answereth to the Jerusalem that now is: for she is in bondage with her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But the Jerusalem that is above is free, which is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written, Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; Break forth and cry, thou that travailest not: For more are the children of the desolate than of her that hath       the husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>Now we, brethren, as Isaac was, are children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>But as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him [that was born] after the Spirit, so also it is now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>Howbeit what saith the scripture? Cast out the handmaid and her son: for the son of the handmaid shall not inherit with the son of the freewoman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>Wherefore, brethren, we are not children of a handmaid, but of the freewoman.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>For freedom did Christ set us free: stand fast therefore, and be not entangled again in a yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold, I Paul say unto you, that, if ye receive circumcision, Christ will profit you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>Yea, I testify again to every man that receiveth circumcision, that he is a debtor to do the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>Ye are severed from Christ, ye would be justified by the law; ye are fallen away from grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>For we through the Spirit by faith wait for the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything, nor uncircumcision; but faith working through love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>Ye were running well; who hindered you that ye should not obey the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>This persuasion [came] not of him that calleth you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven leaveneth the whole lump.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I have confidence to you-ward in the Lord, that ye will be none otherwise minded: but he that troubleth you shall bear his judgment, whosoever he be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>But I, brethren, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still persecuted? then hath the stumbling-block of the cross been done away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>I would that they that unsettle you would even go beyond circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>For ye, brethren, were called for freedom; only [use] not your freedom for an occasion to the flesh, but through love be servants one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, [even] in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not consumed one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>But I say, walk by the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh lusteth against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these are contrary the one to the other; that ye may not do the things that ye would.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if ye are led by the Spirit, ye are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are [these]: fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousies, wraths, factions, divisions, parties,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envyings, drunkenness, revellings, and such like; of which I forewarn you, even as I did forewarn you, that they who practise such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>meekness, self-control; against such there is no law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>And they that are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>If we live by the Spirit, by the Spirit let us also walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>Let us not become vainglorious, provoking one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>Brethren, even if a man be overtaken in any trespass, ye who are spiritual, restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness; looking to thyself, lest thou also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>Bear ye one another`s burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if a man thinketh himself to be something when he is nothing, he deceiveth himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let each man prove his own work, and then shall he have his glorying in regard of himself alone, and not of his neighbor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For each man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>But let him that is taught in the word communicate unto him that teacheth in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>For he that soweth unto his own flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption; but he that soweth unto the Spirit shall of the Spirit reap eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap, if we faint not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>So then, as we have opportunity, let us work that which is good toward all men, and especially toward them that are of the household of the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>See with how large letters I write unto you with mine own hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>As many as desire to make a fair show in the flesh, they compel you to be circumcised; only that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For not even they who receive circumcision do themselves keep the law; but they desire to have you circumcised, that they may glory in your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But far be it from me to glory, save in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world hath been crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For neither is circumcision anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And as many as shall walk by this rule, peace [be] upon them, and mercy, and upon the Israel of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>Henceforth, let no man trouble me; for I bear branded on my body the marks of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brethren. Amen.</verse>
