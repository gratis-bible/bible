      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth; for Jehovah hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master`s crib; [but] Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, children that deal corruptly! they have forsaken Jehovah, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are estranged [and gone] backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no soundness in it; [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither mollified with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire; your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Except Jehovah of hosts had left unto us a very small remnant, we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of Jehovah, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>What unto me is the multitude of your sacrifices? saith Jehovah: I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of bullocks, or of lambs, or of he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at your hand, to trample my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto me; new moon and sabbath, the calling of assemblies,- I cannot away with iniquity and the solemn meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>learn to do well; seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword; for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How is the faithful city become a harlot! she that was full of justice! righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves; every one loveth bribes, and followeth after rewards: they judge not the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me of mine enemies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>and I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be called The city of righteousness, a faithful town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden that hath no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall be as tow, and his work as a spark; and they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of Jehovah`s house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall flow unto it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of Jehovah from Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples; and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks; nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of Jehovah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are filled [with customs] from the east, and [are] soothsayers like the Philistines, and they strike hands with the children of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures; their land also is full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is brought low: therefore forgive them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up; and it shall be brought low;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant imagery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols shall utterly pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty, when he ariseth to shake mightily the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for wherein is he to be accounted of?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, doth take away from Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>the mighty man, and the man of war; the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counsellor, and the expert artificer, and the skilful enchanter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor: the child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying], Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>in that day shall he lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer; for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: ye shall not make me ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen; because their tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The show of their countenance doth witness against them; and they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto their soul! for they have done evil unto themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say ye of the righteous, that [it shall be] well [with him]; for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe unto the wicked! [it shall be] ill [with him]; for what his hands have done shall be done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, they that lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>Jehovah standeth up to contend, and standeth to judge the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the princes thereof: It is ye that have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>what mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>therefore the Lord will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day the Lord will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the cauls, and the crescents;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the headtires, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the rings, and the nose-jewels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of well set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth; branding instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day shall the branch of Jehovah be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst thereof, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And Jehovah will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night; for over all the glory [shall be spread] a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the day-time from the heat, and for a refuge and for a covert from storm and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Let me sing for my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>and he digged it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up; I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>and I will lay it waste; it shall not be pruned nor hoed; but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression; for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to field, till there be no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In mine ears [saith] Jehovah of hosts, Of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield [but] an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink; that tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the harp and the lute, the tabret and the pipe, and wine, are [in] their feasts; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, neither have they considered the operation of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people are gone into captivity for lack of knowledge; and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore Sheol hath enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure; and their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he that rejoiceth among them, descend [into it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And the mean man is bowed down, and the great man is humbled, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>but Jehovah of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then shall the lambs feed as in their pasture, and the waste places of the fat ones shall wanderers eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>that say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw nigh and come, that we may know it!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.20'>Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.21'>Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in their own sight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.22'>Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of strength to mingle strong drink;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>that justify the wicked for a bribe, and take away the righteousness of the righteous from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and as the dry grass sinketh down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; because they have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his people, and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath smitten them; and the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their horses` hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>their roaring shall be like a lioness, they shall roar like young lions; yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold, darkness [and] distress; and the light is darkened in the clouds thereof.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above him stood the seraphim: each one had six wings; with twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is Jehovah of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then flew one of the seraphim unto me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>and he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this hath touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, Here am I; send me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.9'>And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes; lest they sea with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn again, and be healed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.53.2'>For he grew up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.3'>He was despised, and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief: and as one from whom men hide their face he was despised; and we esteemed him not.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.53.9'>And they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death; although he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.10'>Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath put him to grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he shall see [his] seed, he shall prolong his days, and the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.11'>He shall see of the travail of his soul, [and] shall be satisfied: by the knowledge of himself shall my righteous servant justify many; and he shall bear their iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.53.12'>Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he poured out his soul unto death, and was numbered with the transgressors: yet he bare the sin of many, and made intercession for the transgressors.</verse>
