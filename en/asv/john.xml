      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>The same was in the beginning with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>All things were made through him; and without him was not anything made that hath been made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life; and the life was the light of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>And the light shineth in the darkness; and the darkness apprehended it not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There came a man, sent from God, whose name was John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>The same came for witness, that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the light, but [came] that he might bear witness of the light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>There was the true light, [even the light] which lighteth every man, coming into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>He was in the world, and the world was made through him, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came unto his own, and they that were his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But as many as received him, to them gave he the right to become children of God, [even] to them that believe on his name:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us (and we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father), full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>John beareth witness of him, and crieth, saying, This was he of whom I said, He that cometh after me is become before me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>For of his fulness we all received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and truth came through Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>No man hath seen God at any time; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this is the witness of John, when the Jews sent unto him from Jerusalem priests and Levites to ask him, Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed, and denied not; and he confessed, I am not the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him, What then? Art thou Elijah? And he saith, I am not. Art thou the prophet? And he answered, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>They said therefore unto him, Who art thou? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He said, I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said Isaiah the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>And they had been sent from the Pharisees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they asked him, and said unto him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Christ, neither Elijah, neither the prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>John answered them, saying, I baptize in water: in the midst of you standeth one whom ye know not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>[even] he that cometh after me, the latchet of whose shoe I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>On the morrow he seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God, that taketh away the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he of whom I said, After me cometh a man who is become before me: for he was before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not; but that he should be made manifest to Israel, for this cause came I baptizing in water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And John bare witness, saying, I have beheld the Spirit descending as a dove out of heaven; and it abode upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not: but he that sent me to baptize in water, he said unto me, Upon whomsoever thou shalt see the Spirit descending, and abiding upon him, the same is he that baptizeth in the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>And I have seen, and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>Again on the morrow John was standing, and two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and he looked upon Jesus as he walked, and saith, Behold, the Lamb of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And the two disciples heard him speak, and they followed Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jesus turned, and beheld them following, and saith unto them, What seek ye? And they said unto him, Rabbi (which is to say, being interpreted, Teacher), where abideth thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith unto them, Come, and ye shall see. They came therefore and saw where he abode; and they abode with him that day: it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>One of the two that heard John [speak], and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter`s brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>He findeth first his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messiah (which is, being interpreted, Christ).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>He brought him unto Jesus. Jesus looked upon him, and said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas (which is by interpretation, Peter).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>On the morrow he was minded to go forth into Galilee, and he findeth Philip: and Jesus saith unto him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philip was from Bethsaida, of the city of Andrew and Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philip findeth Nathanael, and saith unto him, We have found him, of whom Moses in the law, and the prophets, wrote, Jesus of Nazareth, the son of Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>And Nathanael said unto him, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip saith unto him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him, and saith of him, Behold, an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael saith unto him, Whence knowest thou me? Jesus answered and said unto him, Before Philip called thee, when thou wast under the fig tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered him, Rabbi, thou art the Son of God; thou art King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Because I said unto thee, I saw thee underneath the fig tree, believest thou? thou shalt see greater things than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>And he saith unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Ye shall see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>And the third day there was a marriage in Cana of Galilee; and the mother of Jesus was there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and Jesus also was bidden, and his disciples, to the marriage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And when the wine failed, the mother of Jesus saith unto him, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>And Jesus saith unto her, Woman, what have I to do with thee? mine hour is not yet come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother saith unto the servants, Whatsoever he saith unto you, do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six waterpots of stone set there after the Jews` manner of purifying, containing two or three firkins apiece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jesus saith unto them, Fill the waterpots with water. And they filled them up to the brim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>And he saith unto them, Draw out now, and bear unto the ruler of the feast. And they bare it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And when the ruler of the feast tasted the water now become wine, and knew not whence it was (but the servants that had drawn the water knew), the ruler of the feast calleth the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and saith unto him, Every man setteth on first the good wine; and when [men] have drunk freely, [then] that which is worse: thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This beginning of his signs did Jesus in Cana of Galilee, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>After this he went down to Capernaum, he, and his mother, and [his] brethren, and his disciples; and there they abode not many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the passover of the Jews was at hand, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the changers of money sitting:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>and he made a scourge of cords, and cast all out of the temple, both the sheep and the oxen; and he poured out the changers` money, and overthrew their tables;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>and to them that sold the doves he said, Take these things hence; make not my Father`s house a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>His disciples remembered that it was written, Zeal for thy house shall eat me up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jews therefore answered and said unto him, What sign showest thou unto us, seeing that thou doest these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jesus answered and said unto them, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jews therefore said, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou raise it up in three days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spake of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>When therefore he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he spake this; and they believed the scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>Now when he was in Jerusalem at the passover, during the feast, many believed on his name, beholding his signs which he did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But Jesus did not trust himself unto them, for that he knew all men,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and because he needed not that any one should bear witness concerning man; for he himself knew what was in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>Now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>the same came unto him by night, and said to him, Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no one can do these signs that thou doest, except God be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nicodemus saith unto him, How can a man be born when he is old? can he enter a second time into his mother`s womb, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except one be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>That which is born of the flesh is flesh; and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Marvel not that I said unto thee, Ye must be born anew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind bloweth where it will, and thou hearest the voice thereof, but knowest not whence it cometh, and whither it goeth: so is every one that is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nicodemus answered and said unto him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jesus answered and said unto him, Art thou the teacher of Israel, and understandest not these things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, We speak that which we know, and bear witness of that which we have seen; and ye receive not our witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If I told you earthly things and ye believe not, how shall ye believe if I tell you heavenly things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>And no one hath ascended into heaven, but he that descended out of heaven, [even] the Son of man, who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that whosoever believeth may in him have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth on him should not perish, but have eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For God sent not the Son into the world to judge the world; but that the world should be saved through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He that believeth on him is not judged: he that believeth not hath been judged already, because he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment, that the light is come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light; for their works were evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one that doeth evil hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his works should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he that doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be made manifest, that they have been wrought in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>After these things came Jesus and his disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>And John also was baptizing in Enon near to Salim, because there was much water there: and they came, and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>For John was not yet cast into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>There arose therefore a questioning on the part of John`s disciples with a Jew about purifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, he that was with thee beyond the Jordan, to whom thou hast borne witness, behold, the same baptizeth, and all men come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it have been given him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but, that I am sent before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, that standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom`s voice: this my joy therefore is made full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>He must increase, but I must decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>He that cometh from above is above all: he that is of the earth is of the earth, and of the earth he speaketh: he that cometh from heaven is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>What he hath seen and heard, of that he beareth witness; and no man receiveth his witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>He that hath received his witness hath set his seal to [this], that God is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom God hath sent speaketh the words of God: for he giveth not the Spirit by measure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loveth the Son, and hath given all things into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He that believeth on the Son hath eternal life; but he that obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making and baptizing more disciples than John</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(although Jesus himself baptized not, but his disciples),</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Judea, and departed again into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>And he must needs pass through Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>So he cometh to a city of Samaria, called Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave to his son Joseph:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>and Jacob`s well was there. Jesus therefore, being wearied with his journey, sat thus by the well. It was about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water: Jesus saith unto her, Give me to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>For his disciples were gone away into the city to buy food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The Samaritan woman therefore saith unto him, How is it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who am a Samaritan woman? (For Jews have no dealings with Samaritans.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jesus answered and said unto unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who it is that saith to thee, Give me to drink; thou wouldest have asked of him, and he would have given thee living water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>The woman saith unto him, Sir, thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: whence then hast thou that living water?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his sons, and his cattle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jesus answered and said unto her, Every one that drinketh of this water shall thirst again:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a well of water springing up unto eternal life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>The woman saith unto him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come all the way hither to draw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jesus saith unto her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>The woman answered and said unto him, I have no husband. Jesus saith unto her, Thou saidst well, I have no husband:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for thou hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast is not thy husband: this hast thou said truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>The woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers worshipped in this mountain; and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when neither in this mountain, nor in Jerusalem, shall ye worship the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>Ye worship that which ye know not: we worship that which we know; for salvation is from the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek to be his worshippers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>God is a Spirit: and they that worship him must worship in spirit and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>The woman saith unto him, I know that Messiah cometh (he that is called Christ): when he is come, he will declare unto us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee am [he].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And upon this came his disciples; and they marvelled that he was speaking with a woman; yet no man said, What seekest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>So the woman left her waterpot, and went away into the city, and saith to the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man, who told me all things that [ever] I did: can this be the Christ?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>They went out of the city, and were coming to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>In the mean while the disciples prayed him, saying, Rabbi, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said unto them, I have meat to eat that ye know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>The disciples therefore said one to another, Hath any man brought him [aught] to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jesus saith unto them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent me, and to accomplish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Say not ye, There are yet four months, and [then] cometh the harvest? behold, I say unto you, Lift up your eyes, and look on the fields, that they are white already unto harvest.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>And from that city many of the Samaritans believed on him because of the word of the woman, who testified, He told me all things that [ever] I did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>So when the Samaritans came unto him, they besought him to abide with them: and he abode there two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>And many more believed because of his word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>and they said to the woman, Now we believe, not because of thy speaking: for we have heard for ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>And after the two days he went forth from thence into Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>For Jesus himself testified, that a prophet hath no honor in his own country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>So when he came into Galilee, the Galilaeans received him, having seen all the things that he did in Jerusalem at the feast: for they also went unto the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>He came therefore again unto Cana of Galilee, where he made the water wine. And there was a certain nobleman, whose son was sick at Capernaum.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judaea into Galilee, he went unto him, and besought [him] that he would come down, and heal his son; for he was at the point of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jesus therefore said unto him, Except ye see signs and wonders, ye will in no wise believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The nobleman saith unto him, Sir, come down ere my child die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jesus saith unto him, Go thy way; thy son liveth. The man believed the word that Jesus spake unto him, and he went his way.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>So he inquired of them the hour when he began to amend. They said therefore unto him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>So the father knew that [it was] at that hour in which Jesus said unto him, Thy son liveth: and himself believed, and his whole house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This is again the second sign that Jesus did, having come out of Judaea into Galilee.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>After these things there was a feast of the Jews; and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep [gate] a pool, which is called in Hebrew Bethesda, having five porches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>In these lay a multitude of them that were sick, blind, halt, withered, [waiting for the moving of the water.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>[for an angel of the Lord went down at certain seasons into the pool, and troubled the water: whosoever then first after the troubling of the waters stepped in was made whole, with whatsoever disease he was holden.]</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>And a certain man was there, who had been thirty and eight years in his infirmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time [in that case], he saith unto him, Wouldest thou be made whole?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool: but while I am coming, another steppeth down before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jesus saith unto him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And straightway the man was made whole, and took up his bed and walked. Now it was the sabbath on that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>So the Jews said unto him that was cured, It is the sabbath, and it is not lawful for thee to take up thy bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered them, He that made me whole, the same said unto me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>They asked him, Who is the man that said unto thee, Take up [thy bed], and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he that was healed knew not who it was; for Jesus had conveyed himself away, a multitude being in the place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>Afterward Jesus findeth him in the temple, and said unto him, Behold, thou art made whole: sin no more, lest a worse thing befall thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>The man went away, and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him whole.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>And for this cause the Jews persecuted Jesus, because he did these things on the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But Jesus answered them, My Father worketh even until now, and I work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>For this cause therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him, because he not only brake the sabbath, but also called God his own Father, making himself equal with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>Jesus therefore answered and said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, The Son can do nothing of himself, but what he seeth the Father doing: for what things soever he doeth, these the Son also doeth in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For the Father loveth the Son, and showeth him all things that himself doeth: and greater works than these will he show him, that ye may marvel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For neither doth the Father judge any man, but he hath given all judgment unto the Son;</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, He that heareth my word, and believeth him that sent me, hath eternal life, and cometh not into judgment, but hath passed out of death into life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, The hour cometh, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father hath life in himself, even so gave he to the Son also to have life in himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and he gave him authority to execute judgment, because he is a son of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>Marvel not at this: for the hour cometh, in which all that are in the tombs shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall come forth; they that have done good, unto the resurrection of life; and they that have done evil, unto the resurrection of judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I can of myself do nothing: as I hear, I judge: and my judgment is righteous; because I seek not mine own will, but the will of him that sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I bear witness of myself, my witness is not true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>It is another that beareth witness of me; and I know that the witness which he witnesseth of me is true.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But the witness which I receive is not from man: howbeit I say these things, that ye may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was the lamp that burneth and shineth; and ye were willing to rejoice for a season in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But the witness which I have is greater than [that of] John; for the works which the Father hath given me to accomplish, the very works that I do, bear witness of me, that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father that sent me, he hath borne witness of me. Ye have neither heard his voice at any time, nor seen his form.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>I receive not glory from men.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jesus went up into the mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the passover, the feast of the Jews, was at hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>Jesus therefore lifting up his eyes, and seeing that a great multitude cometh unto him, saith unto Philip, Whence are we to buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>And this he said to prove him: for he himself knew what he would do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philip answered him, Two hundred shillings` worth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one may take a little.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>One of his disciples, Andrew, Simon Peter`s brother, saith unto him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.34'>Jesus answered them, Is it not written in your law, I said, ye are gods?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came (and the scripture cannot be broken),</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany, of the village of Mary and her sister Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>And it was that Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>The sisters therefore sent unto him, saying, Lord, behold, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>But when Jesus heard it, he said, This sickness is not unto death, but for the glory of God, that the Son of God may be glorified thereby.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>When therefore he heard that he was sick, he abode at that time two days in the place where he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>Then after this he saith to the disciples, Let us go into Judaea again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>The disciples say unto him, Rabbi, the Jews were but now seeking to stone thee; and goest thou thither again?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because the light is not in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These things spake he: and after this he saith unto them, Our friend Lazarus is fallen asleep; but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>The disciples therefore said unto him, Lord, if he is fallen asleep, he will recover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>Now Jesus had spoken of his death: but they thought that he spake of taking rest in sleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then Jesus therefore said unto them plainly, Lazarus is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, to the intent ye may believe; nevertheless let us go unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Thomas therefore, who is called Didymus, said unto his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>So when Jesus came, he found that he had been in the tomb four days already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethany was nigh unto Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary, to console them concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Martha therefore, when she heard that Jesus was coming, went and met him: but Mary still sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>Martha therefore said unto Jesus, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>And even now I know that, whatsoever thou shalt ask of God, God will give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jesus saith unto her, Thy brother shall rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha saith unto him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jesus said unto her, I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth on me, though he die, yet shall he live;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>and whosoever liveth and believeth on me shall never die. Believest thou this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She saith unto him, Yea, Lord: I have believed that thou art the Christ, the Son of God, [even] he that cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said this, she went away, and called Mary her sister secretly, saying, The Teacher is her, and calleth thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>And she, when she heard it, arose quickly, and went unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>(Now Jesus was not yet come into the village, but was still in the place where Martha met him.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>The Jews then who were with her in the house, and were consoling her, when they saw Mary, that she rose up quickly and went out, followed her, supposing that she was going unto the tomb to weep there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>Mary therefore, when she came where Jesus was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying unto him, Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews [also] weeping who came with her, he groaned in the spirit, and was troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, Where have ye laid him? They say unto him, Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>Jesus wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>The Jews therefore said, Behold how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, Could not this man, who opened the eyes of him that was blind, have caused that this man also should not die?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jesus therefore again groaning in himself cometh to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>Jesus saith, Take ye away the stone. Martha, the sister of him that was dead, saith unto him, Lord, by this time the body decayeth; for he hath been [dead] four days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jesus saith unto her, Said I not unto thee, that, if thou believedst, thou shouldest see the glory of God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>So they took away the stone. And Jesus lifted up his eyes, and said, Father, I thank thee that thou heardest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>And I knew that thou hearest me always: but because of the multitude that standeth around I said it, that they may believe that thou didst send me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when he had thus spoken, he cried with a loud voice, Lazarus, come forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>He that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave-clothes; and his face was bound about with a napkin. Jesus saith unto them, Loose him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>Many therefore of the Jews, who came to Mary and beheld that which he did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>But some of them went away to the Pharisees, and told them the things which Jesus had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>The chief priests therefore and the Pharisees gathered a council, and said, What do we? for this man doeth many signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>If we let him thus alone, all men will believe on him: and the Romans will come and take away both our place and our nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But a certain one of them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said unto them, Ye know nothing at all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor do ye take account that it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people, and that the whole nation perish not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>Now this he said not of himself: but, being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus should die for the nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not for the nation only, but that he might also gather together into one the children of God that are scattered abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>So from that day forth they took counsel that they might put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>Jesus therefore walked no more openly among the Jews, but departed thence into the country near to the wilderness, into a city called Ephraim; and there he tarried with the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>Now the passover of the Jews was at hand: and many went up to Jerusalem out of the country before the passover, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>They sought therefore for Jesus, and spake one with another, as they stood in the temple, What think ye? That he will not come to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given commandment, that, if any man knew where he was, he should show it, that they might take him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>Jesus therefore six days before the passover came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>So they made him a supper there: and Martha served; but Lazarus was one of them that sat at meat with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>Mary therefore took a pound of ointment of pure nard, very precious, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped his feet with her hair: and the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, that should betray him, saith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred shillings, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>Now this he said, not because he cared for the poor; but because he was a thief, and having the bag took away what was put therein.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>Jesus therefore said, Suffer her to keep it against the day of my burying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>For the poor ye have always with you; but me ye have not always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>The common people therefore of the Jews learned that he was there: and they came, not for Jesus` sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom he had raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests took counsel that they might put Lazarus also to death;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because that by reason of him many of the Jews went away, and believed on Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>On the morrow a great multitude that had come to the feast, when they heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took the branches of the palm trees, and went forth to meet him, and cried out, Hosanna: Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jesus, having found a young ass, sat thereon; as it is written,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>These things understood not his disciples at the first: but when Jesus was glorified, then remembered they that these things were written of him, and that they had done these things unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>The multitude therefore that was with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb, and raised him from the dead, bare witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>For this cause also the multitude went and met him, for that they heard that he had done this sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Behold how ye prevail nothing: lo, the world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were certain Greeks among those that went up to worship at the feast:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>these therefore came to Philip, who was of Bethsaida of Galilee, and asked him, saying, Sir, we would see Jesus.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>And Jesus answereth them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the earth and die, it abideth by itself alone; but if it die, it beareth much fruit.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>But this he said, signifying by what manner of death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The multitude therefore answered him, We have heard out of the law that the Christ abideth for ever: and how sayest thou, The Son of man must be lifted up? who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jesus therefore said unto them, Yet a little while is the light among you. Walk while ye have the light, that darkness overtake you not: and he that walketh in the darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While ye have the light, believe on the light, that ye may become sons of light. These things spake Jesus, and he departed and hid himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>But though he had done so many signs before them, yet they believed not on him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, which he spake, Lord, who hath believed our report? And to whom hath the arm of the Lord been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>For this cause they could not believe, for that Isaiah said again,</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>And Jesus cried and said, He that believeth on me, believeth not on me, but on him that sent me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I spake not from myself; but the Father that sent me, he hath given me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew? Thine own nation and the chief priests delivered thee unto me: what hast thou done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jesus answered, My kingdom is not of this world: if my kingdom were of this world, then would my servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews: but now is my kingdom not from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilate therefore said unto him, Art thou a king then? Jesus answered, Thou sayest that I am a king. To this end have I been born, and to this end am I come into the world, that I should bear witness unto the truth. Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilate saith unto him, What is truth? And when he had said this, he went out again unto the Jews, and saith unto them, I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But ye have a custom, that I should release unto you one at the passover: will ye therefore that I release unto you the King of the Jews?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>They cried out therefore again, saying, Not this man, but Barabbas. Now Barabbas was a robber.)</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on his head, and arrayed him in a purple garment;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and they came unto him, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they struck him with their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>And Pilate went out again, and saith unto them, Behold, I bring him out to you, that ye may know that I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>Jesus therefore came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And [Pilate] saith unto them, Behold, the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>When therefore the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify [him], crucify [him]! Pilate saith unto them, Take him yourselves, and crucify him: for I find no crime in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jews answered him, We have a law, and by that law he ought to die, because he made himself the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilate therefore heard this saying, he was the more afraid;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>and he entered into the Praetorium again, and saith unto Jesus, Whence art thou? But Jesus gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilate therefore saith unto him, Speakest thou not unto me? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and have power to crucify thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jesus answered him, Thou wouldest have no power against me, except it were given thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee hath greater sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>Upon this Pilate sought to release him: but the Jews cried out, saying, If thou release this man, thou art not Caesar`s friend: every one that maketh himself a king speaketh against Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>When Pilate therefore heard these words, he brought Jesus out, and sat down on the judgment-seat at a place called The Pavement, but in Hebrew, Gabbatha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>Now it was the Preparation of the passover: it was about the sixth hour. And he saith unto the Jews, Behold, your King!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>They therefore cried out, Away with [him], away with [him], crucify him! Pilate saith unto them, Shall I crucify your King? The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then therefore he delivered him unto them to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>They took Jesus therefore: and he went out, bearing the cross for himself, unto the place called The place of a skull, which is called in Hebrew, Golgotha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>where they crucified him, and with him two others, on either side one, and Jesus in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And Pilate wrote a title also, and put it on the cross. And there was written, JESUS OF NAZARETH, THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>This title therefore read many of the Jews, for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city; and it was written in Hebrew, [and] in Latin, [and] in Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>The chief priests of the Jews therefore said to Pilate, Write not, The King of the Jews; but that he said, I am King of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>The soldiers therefore, when they had crucified Jesus, took his garments and made four parts, to every soldier a part; and also the coat: now the coat was without seam, woven from the top throughout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>They said therefore one to another, Let us not rend it, but cast lots for it, whose it shall be: that the scripture might be fulfilled, which saith, They parted my garments among them, And upon my vesture did they cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>These things therefore the soldiers did. But there were standing by the cross of Jesus his mother, and his mother`s sister, Mary the [wife] of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>When Jesus therefore saw his mother, and the disciple standing by whom he loved, he saith unto his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>Then saith he to the disciple, Behold, thy mother! And from that hour the disciple took her unto his own [home].</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After this Jesus, knowing that all things are now finished, that the scripture might be accomplished, saith, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>There was set there a vessel full of vinegar: so they put a sponge full of the vinegar upon hyssop, and brought it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, he said, It is finished: and he bowed his head, and gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>The Jews therefore, because it was the Preparation, that the bodies should not remain on the cross upon the sabbath (for the day of that sabbath was a high [day]), asked of Pilate that their legs might be broken, and [that] they might be taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>The soldiers therefore came, and brake the legs of the first, and of the other that was crucified with him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>but when they came to Jesus, and saw that he was dead already, they brake not his legs:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>howbeit one of the soldiers with a spear pierced his side, and straightway there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he that hath seen hath borne witness, and his witness is true: and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things came to pass, that the scripture might be fulfilled, A bone of him shall not be broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture saith, They shall look on him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>And after these things Joseph of Arimathaea, being a disciple of Jesus, but secretly for fear of the Jews, asked of Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and Pilate gave [him] leave. He came therefore, and took away his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And there came also Nicodemus, he who at the first came to him by night, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about a hundred pounds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>So they took the body of Jesus, and bound it in linen cloths with the spices, as the custom of the Jews is to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new tomb wherein was never man yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>There then because of the Jews` Preparation (for the tomb was nigh at hand) they laid Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>Now on the first [day] of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, while it was yet dark, unto the tomb, and seeth the stone taken away from the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>She runneth therefore, and cometh to Simon Peter, and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and saith unto them, They have taken away the Lord out of the tomb, and we know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>Peter therefore went forth, and the other disciple, and they went toward the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And they ran both together: and the other disciple outran Peter, and came first to the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>and stooping and looking in, he seeth the linen cloths lying; yet entered he not in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>Simon Peter therefore also cometh, following him, and entered into the tomb; and he beholdeth the linen cloths lying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the napkin, that was upon his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but rolled up in a place by itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then entered in therefore the other disciple also, who came first to the tomb, and he saw, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For as yet they knew not the scripture, that he must rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>So the disciples went away again unto their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mary was standing without at the tomb weeping: so, as she wept, she stooped and looked into the tomb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and she beholdeth two angels in white sitting, one at the head, and one at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they say unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith unto them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>When she had thus said, she turned herself back, and beholdeth Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jesus saith unto her, Woman, why weepest thou? whom seekest thou? She, supposing him to be the gardener, saith unto him, Sir, if thou hast borne him hence, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jesus saith unto her, Mary. She turneth herself, and saith unto him in Hebrew, Rabboni; which is to say, Teacher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jesus saith to her, Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended unto the Father: but go unto my brethren, and say to them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Mary Magdalene cometh and telleth the disciples, I have seen the Lord; and [that] he had said these things unto her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>When therefore it was evening, on that day, the first [day] of the week, and when the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in the midst, and saith unto them, Peace [be] unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>And when he had said this, he showed unto them his hands and his side. The disciples therefore were glad, when they saw the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Jesus therefore said to them again, Peace [be] unto you: as the Father hath sent me, even so send I you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>whose soever sins ye forgive, they are forgiven unto them; whose soever [sins] ye retain, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>The other disciples therefore said unto him, We have seen the Lord. But he said unto them, Except I shall see in his hands the print of the nails, and put my hand into his side, I will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>And after eight days again his disciples were within, and Thomas with them. Jesus cometh, the doors being shut, and stood in the midst, and said, Peace [be] unto you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>Then saith he to Thomas, Reach hither thy finger, and see my hands; and reach [hither] thy hand, and put it into my side: and be not faithless, but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>Thomas answered and said unto him, My Lord and my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jesus saith unto him, Because thou hast seen me, thou hast believed: blessed [are] they that have not seen, and [yet] have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>Many other signs therefore did Jesus in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these are written, that ye may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye may have life in his name.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>After these things Jesus manifested himself again to the disciples at the sea of Tiberias; and he manifested [himself] on this wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There was together Simon Peter, and Thomas called Didymus, and Nathanael of Cana in Galilee, and the [sons] of Zebedee, and two other of his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Simon Peter saith unto them, I go a fishing. They say unto him, We also come with thee. They went forth, and entered into the boat; and that night they took nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when day was now breaking, Jesus stood on the beach: yet the disciples knew not that it was Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>Jesus therefore saith unto them, Children, have ye aught to eat? They answered him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>And he said unto them, Cast the net on the right side of the boat, and ye shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>That disciple therefore whom Jesus loved saith unto Peter, It is the Lord. So when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his coat about him (for he was naked), and cast himself into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the little boat (for they were not far from the land, but about two hundred cubits off), dragging the net [full] of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>So when they got out upon the land, they see a fire of coals there, and fish laid thereon, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>Jesus saith unto them, Bring of the fish which ye have now taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>Simon Peter therefore went up, and drew the net to land, full of great fishes, a hundred and fifty and three: and for all there were so many, the net was not rent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>Jesus saith unto them, Come [and] break your fast. And none of the disciples durst inquire of him, Who art thou? knowing that it was the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>Jesus cometh, and taketh the bread, and giveth them, and the fish likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is now the third time that Jesus was manifested to the disciples, after that he was risen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>So when they had broken their fast, Jesus saith to Simon Peter, Simon, [son] of John, lovest thou me more than these? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He saith to him again a second time, Simon, [son] of John, lovest thou me? He saith unto him, Yea, Lord; thou knowest that I love thee. He saith unto him, Tend my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>He saith unto him the third time, Simon, [son] of John, lovest thou me? Peter was grieved because he said unto him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said unto him, Lord, thou knowest all things; thou knowest that I love thee. Jesus saith unto him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Verily, verily, I say unto thee, When thou wast young, thou girdedst thyself, and walkedst whither thou wouldest: but when thou shalt be old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou wouldest not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>Now this he spake, signifying by what manner of death he should glorify God. And when he had spoken this, he saith unto him, Follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>Peter, turning about, seeth the disciple whom Jesus loved following; who also leaned back on his breast at the supper, and said, Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>Peter therefore seeing him saith to Jesus, Lord, and what shall this man do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jesus saith unto him, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee? Follow thou me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>This saying therefore went forth among the brethren, that that disciple should not die: yet Jesus said not unto him, that he should not die; but, If I will that he tarry till I come, what [is that] to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple that beareth witness of these things, and wrote these things: and we know that his witness is true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>And there are also many other things which Jesus did, the which if they should be written every one, I suppose that even the world itself would not contain the books that should be written.</verse>
