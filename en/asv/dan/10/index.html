And when he had spoken this word unto me, I stood trembling.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel; for from the first day that thou didst set thy heart to understand, and to humble thyself before thy God, thy words were heard: and I am come for thy words` sake.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and twenty days; but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came to help me: and I remained there with the kings of Persia.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days; for the vision is yet for [many] days:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>and when he had spoken unto me according to these words, I set my face toward the ground, and was dumb.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And, behold, one in the likeness of the sons of men touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake and said unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by reason of the vision my sorrows are turned upon me, and I retain no strength.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in me, neither was there breath left in me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>Then there touched me again one like the appearance of a man, and he strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee, be strong, yea, be strong. And when he spake unto me, I was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast strengthened me.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I am come unto thee? and now will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I go forth, lo, the prince of Greece shall come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But I will tell thee that which is inscribed in the writing of truth: and there is none that holdeth with me against these, but Michael your prince.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
