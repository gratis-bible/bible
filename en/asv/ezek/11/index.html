Then fell I down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice, and said, Ah Lord Jehovah! wilt thou make a full end of the remnant of Israel?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>Son of man, thy brethren, even thy brethren, the men of thy kindred, and all the house of Israel, all of them, [are they] unto whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, Get you far from Jehovah; unto us is this land given for a possession.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Whereas I have removed them far off among the nations, and whereas I have scattered them among the countries, yet will I be to them a sanctuary for a little while in the countries where they are come.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: I will gather you from the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries where ye have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>And they shall come thither, and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof and all the abominations thereof from thence.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And I will give them one heart, and I will put a new spirit within you; and I will take the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>that they may walk in my statutes, and keep mine ordinances, and do them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>But as for them whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things and their abominations, I will bring their way upon their own heads, saith the Lord Jehovah.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>Then did the cherubim lift up their wings, and the wheels were beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over them above.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And the glory of Jehovah went up from the midst of the city, and stood upon the mountain which is on the east side of the city.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>And the Spirit lifted me up, and brought me in the vision by the Spirit of God into Chaldea, to them of the captivity.
