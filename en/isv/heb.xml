      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <title>All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with all of you! Amen.</title>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>God, having spoken in former times in fragmentary and varied fashion to our forefathers by the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>has in these last days spoken to us by a Son whom he appointed to be the heir of everything and through whom he also made the universe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>He is the reflection of God's glory and the exact likeness of his being, and he holds everything together by his powerful word. After he had provided a cleansing from sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Highest Majesty</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>and became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is better than theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>For to which of the angels did God ever say, “You are my Son. Today I have become your Father”? Or again, “I will be his Father, and he will be my Son”?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>And again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, “Let all God's angels worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>Now about the angels he says, 	“He makes his angels winds,and his servants flames of fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>But about the Son he says,	“Your throne, O God,is forever and ever,	and the scepter of your kingdomis a righteous scepter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>You have loved righteousnessand hated wickedness.	That is why God, your God,anointed you rather than your companionswith the oil of gladness.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>And,	“In the beginning, Lord,you laid the foundation of the earth,and the heavens are the work of your hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>They will come to an end,but you will remain forever.They will all wear out like clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>You will roll them up like a robe,and they will be changed like clothes.	But you remain the same,and your years will never end.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>But to which of the angels did he ever say,	“Sit at my right handuntil I make your enemies a footstool for your feet”?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>All of them are spirits on a divine mission, sent to serve those who are about to inherit salvation, aren't they?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>For this reason we must pay closer attention to the things we have heard, or we may drift away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>For if the message spoken by angels was reliable, and every violation and act of disobedience received its just punishment,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>how will we escape if we neglect a salvation as great as this? It was first proclaimed by the Lord himself, and then it was confirmed to us by those who heard him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>while God added his testimony through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>For he did not put the coming world we are talking about under the control of angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>Instead, someone has declared somewhere,	“What is man that you should remember him,or the son of man that you should care for him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>You made him a little lower than the angels,yet you crowned him with glory and honor</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>and put everything under his feet.”Now when God put everything under him, he left nothing outside his control. However, at the present time we do not yet see everything put under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>But we do see someone who was made a little lower than the angels. He is Jesus, who is crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might experience death for everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>In bringing many children to glory, it was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>For both the one who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>when he says, “I will announce your name to my brothers. I will praise you within the congregation.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>And again, “I will trust him.” And again, “I am here with the children God has given me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>Therefore, since the children have flesh and blood, he himself also shared the same things, so that by his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death (that is, the devil)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>and might free those who were slaves all their lives because they were terrified by death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>For it is clear that he did not come to help angels. No, he came to help Abraham's descendants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>Thus he had to become like his brothers in every way, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and could atone for the people's sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>Therefore, holy brothers, partners in a heavenly calling, keep your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was in all God's household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>For he is worthy of greater glory than Moses in the same way that the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>After all, every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>Moses was faithful in all God's household as a servant who was to testify to what would be said later,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>but Christ was faithful as the Son in charge of God's household, and we are his household if we hold on to our courage and the hope that we boast about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,	“Today, if you hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>do not harden your heartsas they did when they provoked meduring the time of testing in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>There your ancestors tested me,even though they had seen my works</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>for forty years.	That is why I was indignant with that generation and said,‘They are always going astray in their hearts,and they have not known my ways.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>So in my anger I swore a solemn oaththat they would never enter my rest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>See to it, my brothers, that no evil, unbelieving heart is found in any of you, as shown by your turning away from the living God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>Instead, continue to encourage one another every day, as long as it is called “Today,” so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>For we are Christ's partners only if we hold on to our original confidence to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>As it is said,	“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts as they didwhen they provoked me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>Now who heard him and provoked him? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>And with whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned and whose bodies fell in the wilderness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest, if not to those who disobeyed him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>So we see that they were unable to enter because of their unbelief.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>Therefore, as long as the promise of entering his rest remains valid, let us be afraid lest someone among you fails to reach it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>For we have had the good news told to us as well as to them, but the message they heard did not help them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>For we who have believed are entering that rest, just as he has said,	“So in my anger I swore a solemn oaththat they would never enter my rest,”even though his works had been finished since the foundation of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>For somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day as follows: “On the seventh day God rested from all his works,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>and again in this place, “They will never enter my rest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>Therefore, since it is still true that some will enter it, and since those who once heard the good news failed to enter it because of their disobedience,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>he again fixes a definite day—“Today”—saying long afterward through David, as already quoted,	“Today, if you hear his voice,do not harden your hearts.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken later about another day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>There remains, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>For the one who enters God's rest has himself rested from his own works, just as God did from his.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fail by following their example of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, as it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>No creature can hide from him, but all are naked and helpless before the eyes of the one to whom we must give a word of explanation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us continue to hold on to our confession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>So let us keep on coming with boldness to the throne of grace, so that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>For every high priest selected from among men is appointed to officiate on their behalf in matters relating to God, that is, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>He can deal gently with people who are ignorant and easily deceived, since he himself is subject to weakness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>For that reason he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for those of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>No one takes this honor upon himself but he is called to it by God, just as Aaron was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>In the same way, Christ did not take upon himself the glory of being a high priest. No, it was God who said to him,	“You are my Son.Today I have become your Father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>As he also says in another place,	“You are a priest foreveraccording to the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>In the days of his flesh, he offered up prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his devotion to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>Son though he was, he learned obedience through his sufferings</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>having been designated by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>We have much to say about this, but it is difficult to explain because you have become too lazy to understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>In fact, though by now you should be teachers, you still need someone to teach you the basic truths of God's word. You have become people who need milk instead of solid food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>For everyone who lives on milk is still a baby and is inexperienced in the message of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>But solid food is for mature people, whose minds are trained by practice to distinguish good from evil.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>Therefore, leaving behind the elementary teachings about Christ, let us continue to be carried along to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works, faith toward God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>And this we will do, if God permits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>For it is impossible to keep on restoring to repentance time and again people who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have become sharers of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>who have tasted the goodness of God's word and the powers of the coming age,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>and who have fallen away, as long as they continue to crucify to themselves the Son of God and to expose him to public ridicule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>For when the ground soaks up rain that often falls on it and continues producing vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated, it receives a blessing from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>However, if it continues to produce thorns and thistles, it is worthless and in danger of being cursed, and in the end will be burned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case, things that point to salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have ministered to the saints and continue to minister to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>But we want each of you to continue to show this same diligence to the very end, in order to give full assurance to your hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>Then, instead of being lazy, you will become imitators of those who are inheriting the promises through faith and patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>For when God made his promise to Abraham, he swore an oath by himself, since he had no one greater to swear by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>He said, “I will certainly bless you and give you many descendants.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>And so he obtained the promise, because he patiently waited for it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all argument.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>In the same way, when God wanted to make the unchangeable character of his purpose perfectly clear to the heirs of his promise, he guaranteed it with an oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>so that by these two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to prove false, we who have taken refuge in him might have a strong encouragement to seize the hope set before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>We have this hope as an anchor for our souls, firm and secure, which reaches behind the curtain,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>where Jesus, our forerunner, has gone on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>Now this man Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham and blessed him when he was returning from slaughtering the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>To him Abraham gave a tenth of everything. In the first place, his name means “king of righteousness,” and then he is also king of Salem, that is, “king of peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>He has no father, mother, or genealogy, and has neither beginning of days nor end of life. Like the Son of God, he continues to be a priest forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>Just look at how great this man was! Even Abraham—the patriarch himself—gave him a tenth of what he had captured!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>The descendants of Levi who accept the priesthood have a commandment in the law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their own brothers, even though they are also descendants of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>But this man, whose descent is not traced from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the man who had received the promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>It is beyond dispute that the less important person is blessed by the more important person.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>The men who collect the tenth die, but we are told that he keeps on living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>for he was still in the body of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>Now if perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood—for on this basis the people received the law—what further need would there be to speak of appointing another kind of priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not one according to the order of Aaron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>For when a change in the priesthood takes place, there must also be a change in the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>For the person we are talking about belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>For it is obvious that our Lord was a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>This point is even more obvious in that another priest who is like Melchizedek has appeared</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>who was appointed to be a priest, not on the basis of a regulation concerning his ancestry, but rather on the basis of the power of an indestructible life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>For it is declared about him,	“You are a priest foreveraccording to the order of Melchizedek.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>Indeed, the cancellation of the former regulation has occurred because it was weak and ineffective</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>(for the law made nothing perfect), and a better hope is introduced, by which we approach God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.20'>Now none of this happened without an oath. Others became priests without any oath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.21'>but Jesus became a priest with an oath when God said to him,	“The Lord has taken an oathand will not change his mind.	You are a priest forever.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.22'>In this way, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.23'>There have been many priests, since they have been prevented by death from continuing in office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.24'>But because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.25'>Therefore, because he always lives to intercede for them, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.26'>We need such a high priest—one who is holy, innocent, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.27'>He has no need to offer sacrifices every day like those high priests, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he sacrificed himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.28'>For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the word of the oath, which came after the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.8'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.1'>Now the main point in what we are saying is this: we do have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.2'>and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord and not by any human.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.3'>For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, this high priest had to offer something too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.4'>Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because other men offer the gifts prescribed by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.5'>They serve in a sanctuary that is a copy and shadow of the heavenly one. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle: “See to it that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.6'>However, Jesus has now obtained a ministry that is as superior to theirs as the covenant he mediates is founded on better promises.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.7'>For if the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.8'>But God found something wrong with his people when he said,	“Look! The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenantwith the house of Israeland with the house of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.9'>It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors at the timewhen I took them by the handand brought them out of the land of Egypt. 	Because they did not remain loyal to my covenant,I ignored them, declares the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.10'>For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israelafter those days, declares the Lord:	I will put my laws in their mindsand write them on their hearts.	I will be their God,and they will be my people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.11'>Never again will everyone teach his neighbor or his brother by saying, ‘Know the Lord,’	because all of them will know me,from the least important to the most important.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.12'>For I will be merciful regarding their wrong deeds,and I will never again remember their sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.8.13'>In speaking of a “new” covenant, he has made the first one obsolete, and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.9'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.1'>Now even first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.2'>For a tabernacle was set up, and in the first part were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the Presence. This was called the Holy Place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.3'>Behind the second curtain was the part of the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.4'>which had the gold altar for incense and the ark of the covenant completely covered with gold. In it were the gold jar holding the manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the tablets of the covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.5'>Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of atonement. (We cannot discuss these things in detail now.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.6'>When everything had been arranged like this, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle to perform their duties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.7'>But only the high priest went into the second part, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins committed by the people in ignorance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.8'>The Holy Spirit was indicating by this that the way into the Holy of Holies had not yet been disclosed as long as the first part of the tabernacle was still standing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.9'>This is an illustration of the present time, indicating that the gifts and sacrifices being offered could not make the conscience of the worshiper perfect,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.10'>since they deal only with food, drink, and various washings, which are required for the body until the time when things would be set right.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.11'>But when Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands and that is not a part of this creation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.12'>Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood he went into the Holy of Holies once for all and secured our eternal redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.13'>For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are unclean purifies them with physical cleansing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.14'>how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works so that we may serve the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.15'>This is why he is the mediator of a new covenant; so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance promised them, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the offenses committed under the first covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.16'>For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.17'>For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect as long as the one who made it is alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.18'>This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.19'>For after every commandment in the law had been spoken to all the people by Moses, he took the blood of calves and goats, together with some water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.20'>saying, “This is the blood of the covenant that God ordained for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.21'>In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.22'>In fact, under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of the blood there is no forgiveness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.23'>Thus it was necessary for the copies of the things in heaven to be cleansed by these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.24'>For Christ did not go into a sanctuary made by human hands and just a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, now to appear in God's presence on our behalf.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.25'>Nor did he go into heaven to sacrifice himself again and again, the way the high priest goes into the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.26'>Then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But now, at the end of the ages, he has appeared once for all to remove sin by his sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.27'>Indeed, just as people are appointed to die once and after that to be judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.9.28'>so Christ was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people. And he will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly wait for him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.10'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.1'>For the law, being only a reflection of the blessings to come and not their substance, can never, by the same sacrifices repeatedly offered year after year, make those who come near perfect.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.2'>Otherwise, would they not have stopped offering them, because the worshipers, cleansed once for all, would no longer be aware of any sins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.3'>Instead, through those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.4'>for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.5'>For this reason, when Christ came into the world, he said,	“You did not want sacrifices and offerings,but you prepared a body for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.6'>In burnt offerings and sin offeringsyou never took delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.7'>Then I said, ‘See, I have come to do your will, O God’(in the scroll of the Book this is written about me).”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.8'>In this passage he says, “You never wanted or took delight in sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings,” which are offered according to the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.9'>Then he says, “See, I have come to do your will.” He takes away the first in order to establish the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.10'>By his will we have been sanctified once for all through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.11'>Day after day every priest stands and repeatedly offers the same sacrifices that can never take away sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.12'>But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, “he sat down at the right hand of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.13'>Since that time, he has been waiting for his enemies to be made a footstool for his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.14'>For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.15'>The Holy Spirit also assures us of this. For he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.16'>“This is the covenant that I will make with themafter those days, declares the Lord:	I will put my laws in their heartsand will write them on their minds,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.17'>and,	“I will never again remember their sinsand their lawless deeds.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.18'>Now where there is forgiveness of these sins, there is no longer any offering for sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.19'>Therefore, my brothers, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.20'>the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.21'>and since we have a great high priest over the household of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.22'>let us continue to come near with sincere hearts in full assurance of faith, because our hearts have been sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies have been washed with pure water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.23'>Let us continue to hold firmly to the hope that we confess without wavering, for the one who made the promise is faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.24'>And let us continue to consider how to stimulate one another to love and good deeds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.25'>not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another even more as you see the day coming nearer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.26'>For if we choose to go on sinning after we have received the full knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.27'>but only a terrifying prospect of judgment and a raging fire that will consume the enemies of God</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.28'>Anyone who violates the law of Moses dies without mercy “on the testimony of two or three witnesses.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.29'>How much more severe a punishment do you think that person deserves who tramples on God's Son, treats as common the blood of the covenant by which it was sanctified, and insults the Spirit of grace?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.30'>For we know the one who said, “Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay them back,” and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.31'>It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.32'>But you must continue to remember those earlier days, how after you were enlightened you endured a hard and painful struggle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.33'>At times you were made a public spectacle through insults and persecutions, while at other times you associated with people who were treated this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.34'>For you sympathized with the prisoners and cheerfully submitted to the violent seizure of your property, because you know that you have a better and more permanent possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.35'>So do not throw away your confidence, since it holds a great reward for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.36'>For you need endurance, so that after you have done God's will you can receive what he has promised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.37'>For	“in a very little whilethe one who is coming will returnand will not delay;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.38'>but my righteous one will live by faith,and if he turns back,my soul will take no pleasure in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.10.39'>Now, we do not belong to those who turn back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.11'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.1'>Now faith is the assurance of things we hope for, the certainty of things we cannot see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.2'>For by it our ancestors won approval.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.3'>By faith we understand that the universe was prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.4'>By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain did, and by it he was declared to be righteous, since God himself accepted his offerings. And by faith he continues to speak, even though he is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.5'>By faith Enoch was taken away without experiencing death. He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he won approval as one who pleased God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.6'>Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for the one who comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.7'>By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, reverently prepared an ark to save his family, and by it he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.8'>By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.9'>By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him of the same promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.10'>For he was waiting for the city with permanent foundations, whose architect and builder is God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.11'>By faith Sarah, even though she was old and barren, received the strength to conceive, because she was convinced that the one who had made the promise was faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.12'>Abraham was as good as dead, yet from this one man came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.13'>All these people died having faith. They did not receive the things that were promised, yet they saw them in the distant future and welcomed them, acknowledging that they were strangers and foreigners on earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.14'>For people who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.15'>If they had been thinking about what they had left behind, they would have had an opportunity to go back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.16'>Instead, they were longing for a better country, that is, a heavenly one. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, because he has prepared a city for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.17'>By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac. The man who had received the promises was about to offer his unique son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.18'>about whom it had been said, “It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.19'>He was certain that God could raise people from the dead, and figuratively speaking he did get him back in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.20'>By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.21'>By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons “and worshiped while leaning on the top of his staff.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.22'>By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites and gave them instructions about burying his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.23'>By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months after he was born, because they saw that he was a beautiful child and were not afraid of the king's order.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.24'>By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.25'>because he preferred being mistreated with God's people to enjoying the pleasures of sin for a short time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.26'>He thought that being insulted for the sake of Christ was of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.27'>By faith he left Egypt, without being afraid of the king's anger, and he persevered because he saw the one who is invisible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.28'>By faith he established the Passover and the sprinkling of blood to keep the destroyer of the firstborn from touching the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.29'>By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it were dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do this, they were drowned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.30'>By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.31'>By faith Rahab the prostitute did not die with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies with a greeting of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.32'>And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell you about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.33'>Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice, received promises, shut the mouths of lions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.34'>put out raging fires, escaped death by the sword, found strength in weakness, became powerful in battle, and routed foreign armies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.35'>Women received back their dead through a resurrection. Others were brutally tortured but refused to accept release, so that they might gain a better resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.36'>Still others endured taunts and floggings, and even chains and imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.37'>They were stoned to death, sawed in half, and killed with swords. They went around in sheepskins and goatskins. They were needy, oppressed, and mistreated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.38'>The world wasn’t worthy of them. They wandered in deserts, mountains, caves, and holes in the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.39'>All these people won approval for their faith but did not receive what was promised,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.11.40'>since God had planned something better for us so that they would not become perfect without us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.12'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.1'>Therefore, having so vast a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, and throwing off everything that hinders us and especially the sin that so easily entangles us, let us keep running with endurance the race set before us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.2'>looking off to Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of the faith, who, in view of the joy set before him endured the cross, despising its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.3'>Think about the one who endured such hostility from sinners, so that you may not become tired and give up.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.7'>What you endure is for the sake of discipline. God is treating you as sons. Is there a son whom his father does not discipline?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Heb.12.9'>Furthermore, we had earthly fathers who used to discipline us, and we respected them for it. We should even more submit to the Father of our spirits and live, shouldn't we?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.10'>For a short time they disciplined us as they thought best, but he does it for our good, so that we may share in his holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.11'>No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, for those who have been trained by it, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace.</verse>
