      <chapter osisID='Matt.1'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.1'>This is a record of the birth of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.2'>Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.3'>Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron fathered Aram,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.4'>Aram fathered Aminidab, Aminidab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.5'>Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.6'>and Jesse fathered King David.David fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.7'>Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah fathered Asaph,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.8'>Asaph fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram fathered Uzziah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.9'>Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.10'>Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amos, and Amos fathered Josiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.11'>Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.12'>After the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Salathiel, Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.13'>Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.14'>Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, Achim fathered Eliud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.15'>Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.16'>Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.17'>So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon were fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ were fourteen generations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.18'>Now the birth of Jesus Christ happened in this way. When his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they lived together she was discovered to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.19'>Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to disgrace her, decided to divorce her secretly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.20'>After he had thought about it, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.21'>She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he is the one who will save his people from their sins.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.22'>Now all this happened to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.23'>“See, a virgin will become pregnantand give birth to a son,	and they will name him Immanuel,”which means, “God with us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.24'>When Joseph got up from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary as his wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.1.25'>He did not have marital relations with her until she had given birth to a son; and he named him Jesus.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.2'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.1'>After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.2'>and asked, “Where is the one who was born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.3'>When King Herod heard this he was troubled, and all the people of Jerusalem with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.4'>He called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Christ was to be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.5'>They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea. For that is what was written by the prophet:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.6'>‘O Bethlehem in the land of Judah,you are by no means least among the rulers of Judah.	For from you will come a rulerwho will shepherd my people Israel.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.7'>Then Herod secretly called together the wise men and found out from them the time the star had appeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.8'>Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “As you go, search carefully for the child. When you find him, tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.9'>After listening to the king, they set out, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.10'>When they saw the star, they were ecstatic with joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.11'>After they went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary, they fell down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure sacks and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.12'>Having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they left for their own country by a different road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.13'>After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt. Stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and kill him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.14'>So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and left at night for Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.15'>He stayed there until Herod's death in order to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said, “Out of Egypt I called my Son.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.16'>When Herod saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, he flew into a rage and ordered the execution of all the male children in Bethlehem and all its neighboring regions who were two years old and younger, according to the time that he had determined from the wise men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.17'>Then what was declared by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.18'>“A voice was heard in Ramah:wailing and great mourning.	Rachel was crying for her children.She refused to be comforted,because they no longer existed.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.19'>But after Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.20'>and said, “Get up, take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, for those who were trying to kill the child are dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.21'>So Joseph got up and took the child and his mother and went into the land of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.22'>But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. Having been warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.2.23'>and came and settled in a town called Nazareth in order to fulfill what was said by the prophets: “He will be called a Nazarene.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.3'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.1'>In those days John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the wilderness of Judea</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.2'>and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.3'>He was the one the prophet Isaiah was referring to when he said,	“He is a voice calling out in the wilderness:‘Prepare the way for the Lord!Make his paths straight!’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.4'>John had clothing made of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.5'>Then the people of Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region along the Jordan began flocking to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.6'>being baptized by him in the Jordan River while they confessed their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.7'>But when John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, “You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.8'>Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.9'>Don't think you can say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham for our forefather.’ For I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.10'>The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.11'>I am baptizing you with water as a token of repentance, but the one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.12'>His winnowing fork is in his hand. He will clean up his threshing floor and gather his grain into the barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.13'>Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.14'>But John tried to stop him, saying, “I need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.15'>But Jesus answered him,“Let it be this way for now, for this is the proper way for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then John let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.16'>When Jesus had been baptized, he immediately came up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens opened up for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.3.17'>Then a voice from heaven said, “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him!”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.4'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.1'>Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.2'>After fasting for forty days and forty nights, he finally became hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.3'>The tempter came and said to him, “If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.4'>But he answered,“It is written,	‘One must not live on bread alone,but on every word comingout of the mouth of God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.5'>Then the devil took him to the Holy City and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.6'>He said to Jesus, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down. For it is written,	‘God will put his angels in charge of you,’and	‘With their hands they will hold you up,so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.7'>Jesus said to him,“It is also written,‘You must not tempt the Lord your God.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.8'>Once more the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their splendor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.9'>He said to Jesus, “I will give you all of these things if you will bow down and worship me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.10'>Then Jesus said to him,“Go away,Satan! For it is written,‘You must worship the Lord your Godand serve only him.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.11'>Then the devil left him, and angels came and began ministering to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.12'>Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he went back to Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.13'>He left Nazareth and went and settled in Capernaum by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.14'>in order to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.15'>“O Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali,on the road to the sea, across the Jordan,Galilee of the Gentiles!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.16'>The people living in darkness have seen a great light,and for those living in the land and shadow of death,a light has risen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.17'>From then on, Jesus began to preach and to say,“Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.18'>While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers—Simon, who is called Peter, and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.19'>He said to them,“Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.20'>So at once they left their nets and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.21'>Going on from there he saw two other brothers—James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee repairing their nets. When he called them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.22'>they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.23'>Then he went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.24'>His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him all who were sick—those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed—and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.4.25'>Large crowds followed him from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from across the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.5'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.1'>When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a hillside and sat down. His disciples came to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.2'>and he opened his mouth and began to teach them, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.3'>“How blessed are those who are destitute in spirit,for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.4'>“How blessed are those who mourn,for it is they who will be comforted!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.5'>“How blessed are those who are humble,for it is they who will inherit the earth!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.6'>“How blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness,for it is they who will be satisfied!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.7'>“How blessed are those who are merciful,for it is they who will receive mercy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.8'>“How blessed are those who are pure in heart,for it is they who will see God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.9'>“How blessed are those who make peace,for it is they who will be called God's children!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.10'>“How blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake,for the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.11'>“How blessed are you whenever peopleinsult you, persecute you, and say all sorts of evil things against you falselybecause of me!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.12'>Rejoice and be extremely glad, because your reward in heaven is great! For that's how they persecuted the prophets who came before you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.13'>“You are the salt of the world. But if the salt should lose its taste, how can it be made salty again? It's good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled on by people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.14'>You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.15'>Peopledon't light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lampstand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.16'>In the same way, let your light shine before people in such a way that they will see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.17'>“Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I didn't come to destroy them, but to fulfill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.18'>For truly I tell you, until heaven and earth disappear, not one letteror one stroke of a letter will disappear from the Law until everything has been accomplished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.19'>So whoever sets asideone of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.20'>For I tell you, unless your righteousness greatly exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.21'>“You have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, ‘You must not murder,’and ‘Whoever murders will be subject to punishment.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.22'>But I say to you, anyone who is angry with his brother without a causewill be subject to punishment. And whoever says to his brother ‘Raka!’will be subject to the Council.And whoever says ‘You fool!’ will be subject to hellfire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.23'>“So if you are presenting your gift at the altar and remember there that your brother has something against you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.24'>leave your gift there before the altar and first go and be reconciled to your brother. Then come and offer your gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.25'>Come to terms quickly with your opponent while you are on the way to court,or your opponent may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.26'>Truly I tell you, you will not get out of there until you pay back the last penny!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.27'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You must not commit adultery.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.28'>But I say to you, anyone who stares at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.29'>So if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body thrown into hell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.30'>And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to lose one of your members than to have your whole body go into hell.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.31'>“It was also said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.32'>But I say to you, any man who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.33'>“Again, you have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, ‘You must not swear an oath falsely,’ but ‘You must fulfill your oaths to the Lord.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.34'>But I tell you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is God's throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.35'>nor by the earth, because it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.36'>Nor should you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.37'>Instead, let your word be ‘Yes’ for ‘Yes’ and ‘No’ for ‘No.’ Anything more than that comes from the evil one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.38'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.39'>But I tell you not to resist an evildoer. On the contrary, whoever slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.40'>If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat as well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.41'>And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go two with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.42'>Give to the person who asks you for something, and do not turn away from the person who wants to borrow something from you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.43'>“You have heard that it was said, ‘You must love your neighbor’and hate your enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.44'>But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.45'>so that you will become children of your Father in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and the good, and he lets rain fall on the righteous and the unrighteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.46'>For if you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax collectors do the same, don't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.47'>And if you greet only your brothers, what great thing are you doing? Even the Gentilesdo the same, don't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.5.48'>So be perfect,as your heavenly Father is perfect.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.6'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.1'>“Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people in order to be noticed by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.2'>So whenever you give to the poor, don't blow a trumpet before you like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they will be praised by people. Truly I tell you, they have their full reward!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.6.3'>But when you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.8.2'>Suddenly a leper came up to him, fell down before him, and said, “Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.3'>So Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said,“I do want to. Be made clean!” And instantly his leprosy was made clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.4'>Then Jesus said to him,“See to it that you don't speak to anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded as proof to the authorities.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.5'>When Jesus returned to Capernaum, a centurion came up to him and begged him repeatedly,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.6'>“Sir, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and in terrible pain.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.7'>Jesus said to him,“I will come and heal him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.8'>The centurion replied, “Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.9'>For I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one ‘Go’ and he goes, to another ‘Come’ and he comes, and to my servant ‘Do this’ and he does it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.10'>When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him,“Truly I tell you, not evenin Israel have I found this kind of faith!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.11'>I tell you, many will come from east and west and will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.12'>But the citizensof that kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.13'>Then Jesus said to the centurion,“Go. It will be done for you just as you have believed.” And his servant was healed that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.14'>When Jesus went into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, sick with a fever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.15'>He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began serving him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.16'>When evening came, people brought to him many who were possessed by demons. He drove out the spirits with a word and healed all those who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.17'>This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,	“It was he who took our illnesses awayand removed our diseases.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.18'>When Jesus saw the large crowds around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.19'>Now a scribe came up and said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.20'>Jesus told him,	“Foxes have holes and birds have nests,but the Son of Man has no place to rest.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.21'>Then another of his disciples said to him, “Lord, first let me go and bury my father.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.22'>But Jesus told him,“Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.23'>When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.24'>Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat began to be swamped by the waves. Yet Jesus kept sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.25'>They went to him and woke him up, saying, “Lord, save us! We're going to die!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.26'>He said to them,“Why are you afraid, you who have little faith?” Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.27'>The men were amazed and said, “What kind of man is this? Even the winds and the sea obey him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.28'>When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gerasenes, two demon-possessed men met him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could travel on that road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.29'>Suddenly they screamed, “What do you want with us, Son of God? Did you come here to torture us before the proper time?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.30'>Now a large herd of pigs was grazing some distance away from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.31'>So the demons began to plead with Jesus, saying, “If you drive us out, send us into that herd of pigs.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.32'>He said to them,“Go,” and they came out and went into the pigs. Suddenly, the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and died in the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.33'>Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they came into the city and reported everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.8.34'>Then the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and as soon as they saw him, they begged him to leave their region.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.9'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.1'>After getting into a boat, Jesus crossed to the other side and came to his own city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.2'>All at once some people brought him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man,“Be courageous, son! Your sins are forgiven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.3'>Then some of the scribes said to themselves, “This fellow is blaspheming!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.4'>But Jesus knew their thoughts and said,“Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.5'>For which is easier: to say ‘Your sins are forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.6'>But I want you to knowthat the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins.”Then he said to the paralyzed man,“Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.7'>So the man got up and went home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.8'>When the crowds saw this, they became frightened and glorified God for giving such authority to humans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.9'>As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's desk and said to him,“Follow me.” So he got up and followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.10'>While he was having dinner at Matthew's home, many tax collectors and sinners arrived and began eating with Jesus and his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.11'>The Pharisees saw this and said to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.12'>When Jesus heard that, he said,“Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick people do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.13'>Go and learn what this means: ‘I want mercy and not sacrifice.’For I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.14'>Then John's disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.15'>Jesus said to them,“The wedding guests can't mourn as long as the groom is with them, can they? But the days will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.16'>“No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. For the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.17'>Nor do peoplepour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill out, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.18'>While Jesus was telling them these things, an official came up, fell down before him, and said, “My daughter has just died. But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.19'>So Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.20'>Just then a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel of his garment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.21'>For she had been saying to herself, “If I just touch his robe, I will get well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.22'>When Jesus turned and saw her, he said,“Be courageous, daughter! Your faith has made you well.” And from that very hour the woman was well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.23'>When Jesus came to the official's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.24'>he said,“Go away! The girl hasn't died but is sleeping.” They laughed and laughed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.25'>But when the crowd had been driven outside, he went in and took the girl by the hand, and she got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.26'>The news of this spread throughout that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.27'>As Jesus was traveling on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.28'>When he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him.Jesus asked them,“Do you believe I can do this?”They said to him, “Yes, Lord!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.29'>Then he touched their eyes and said,“According to your faith, let it be done for you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.30'>And their eyes were opened.Then Jesus sternly told them,“See to it that nobody knows about this.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.31'>But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.32'>As they were going out, a man who couldn't talk because he was demon-possessed was brought to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.33'>As soon as the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, “Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.34'>But the Pharisees kept saying, “He drives out demons by the ruler of demons.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.35'>Then Jesus began traveling through all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.36'>When he saw the crowds, he was deeply moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.37'>Then he said to his disciples,“The harvest is vast, but the workers are few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.9.38'>So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.10'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.10.1'>Then Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and every illness.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.14.3'>For Herod had arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.4'>For John had been telling him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.5'>Although Herod wanted to kill him, he was afraid of the crowd, since they regarded John as a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.6'>But when Herod's birthday celebration was held, the daughter of Herodias danced before the guests. She pleased Herod</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.7'>so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.8'>Prompted by her mother, she said, “Give me, right here on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.9'>Though the king was saddened at this, because of his oaths and his guests he ordered it to be given.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.10'>So he sent word and had John beheaded in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.11'>His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.12'>When John's disciples came, they carried off the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.13'>When Jesus heard this, he left that place and went by boat to a deserted place by himself. The crowds heard of it and followed him on foot from the towns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.14'>When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them and healed their sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.15'>Now when evening came, the disciples went to him and said, “This is a deserted place, and it's already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.16'>But Jesus said to them,“They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.17'>They told him, “We don't have anything here except five loaves of bread and two fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.18'>He said,“Bring them here to me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.19'>Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.20'>All of them ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up what was left of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.21'>Now those who had eaten were about 5,000 men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.22'>Jesus immediately had the disciples get into a boat and cross to the other side ahead of him, while he sent the crowds away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.23'>After dismissing the crowds, he went up on a hillside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.24'>By this time the boat was in the middle of the sea and was being battered by the waves, for the wind was against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.25'>Shortly before dawn he came to them, walking on the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.26'>When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified and said, “It's a ghost!” And they screamed in terror.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.27'>Immediately Jesus said to them,“Have courage! It is I. Stop being afraid!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.28'>Peter answered him, “Lord, if it's you, order me to come to you on the water.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.29'>Jesus said,“Come on!” So Peter got down out of the boat, started walking on the water, and came to Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.30'>But when he noticed the strong wind, he was frightened. As he began to sink, he shouted, “Lord, save me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.31'>At once Jesus reached out his hand, caught him, and said to him,“You who have so little faith, why did you doubt?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.32'>As they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.33'>Then the men in the boat began to worship Jesus, saying, “You certainly are the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.34'>They crossed over and came ashore at Gennesaret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.35'>When the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word throughout that region and brought him all who were sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.14.36'>They kept begging him to let them touch just the tassel of his garment, and all who touched it were completely healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.15'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.1'>Then some Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to Jesus and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.2'>“Why do your disciples disregard the tradition of the elders? For they don't wash their hands when they eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.3'>But he answered them,“Why do you also disregard the commandment of God because of your tradition?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.4'>For God said,‘Honor your father and your mother,’and ‘Whoever curses father or mother must certainly be put to death.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.5'>But you say ‘Whoever tells his father or his mother, “Whatever support you might have received from me has been given to God,”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.6'>does not have to honor his father.’Because of your tradition, then, you have revoked the authority of God's word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.7'>You hypocrites! How well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.8'>‘These people honor me with their lips,but their hearts are far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.9'>Their worship of me is empty,because they teach human rules as doctrines.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.10'>Then he called to the crowd and said to them,“Listen and understand!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.11'>It is not what goes into the mouth that makes a person unclean. It is what comes out of the mouth that makes a person unclean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.12'>Then the disciples came and said to him, “Do you realize that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.13'>He replied,“Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be pulled up by the roots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.14'>Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind.If one blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a ditch.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.15'>Then Peter said to him, “Explain to us this parable.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.16'>Jesus said,“Are you still so ignorant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.17'>Don't you know that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then is expelled as waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.18'>But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and it is those things that make a person unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.19'>For it is out of the heart that evil thoughts come, as well as murder, adultery, sexual immorality, stealing, false testimony, and slander.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.20'>These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating with unwashed hands doesn't make a person unclean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.21'>Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.22'>Suddenly a Canaanite woman from that territory came near and began to shout, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.23'>But he didn't answer her at all. Then his disciples came up and kept urging him, “Send her away, for she keeps on screaming after us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.24'>But he replied,“I was sent only to the lost sheep of the nationof Israel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.25'>Then she came and fell down before him, saying, “Lord, help me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.26'>He replied,“It is not rightto take the children's bread and throw it to the puppies.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.27'>She said, “Yes, Lord. But even the puppies eat the crumbs that fall from their masters’ tables.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.28'>Then Jesus answered her,“O woman, your faith is great! Let it be done for you as you want.” That very hour her daughter was healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.29'>Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a hillside and sat down there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.30'>Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those unable to talk, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.31'>As a result, the crowd was amazed to see those who were unable to talk speaking, the crippled healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. So they praised the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.32'>Then Jesus called his disciples and said,“I have compassion for the crowd because they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away without food, or they may faint on the road.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.33'>The disciples asked him, “Where in the wilderness are we to get enough bread to feed such a crowd?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.34'>Jesus said to them,“How many loaves of bread do you have?”They said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.35'>Ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.36'>he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.37'>All of them ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up what was left of the broken pieces, seven baskets full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.38'>Now those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.15.39'>After he sent the crowds away, he got into a boat and went to the region of Magadan.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.16'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.1'>When the Pharisees and Sadducees arrived, as a test they asked Jesus to show them a sign from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.2'>He replied to them,“You say,‘Red sky at night,what a delight!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.3'>Red sky in the morning,cloudy and storming.’You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, yet you can't interpret the signs of the times?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.4'>An evil and adulterous generation craves a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” Then he left them and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.5'>When his disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take any bread along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.6'>Jesus said to them,“Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.7'>They began to discuss this among themselves and said, “We didn't take any bread.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.8'>Knowing this, Jesus said,“You who have little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you don't have any bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.9'>Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000 and how many baskets you collected,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.10'>or the seven loaves for the 4,000 and how many baskets you collected?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.11'>How can you fail to understand that I wasn't talking to you about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.12'>Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the yeast used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.13'>When Jesus had come to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples,“Who do people say the Son of Man is?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.14'>They said, “Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.15'>He said to them,“But who do you say I am?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.16'>Simon Peter answered, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.17'>Then Jesus said to him,“How blessed are you, Simon, son of John!For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father in heaven has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.18'>I tell you that you are Peter,and it is on this rockthat I will build my church, and the forces of hellwill not overpower it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.19'>I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you prohibit on earth will have beenprohibitedin heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will have been permittedin heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.20'>Then he strictly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.21'>From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he would have to go to Jerusalem and suffer a great deal because of the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he would be killed, but on the third day he would be raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.22'>Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, “God be merciful to you, Lord! This must never happen to you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.23'>But Jesus turned around and said to Peter,“Get behind me, Satan! You are an offenseto me, for you are not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.24'>Then Jesus said to his disciples,“If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.16.25'>For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.17'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.1'>Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.2'>His appearance was changed in front of them, his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.3'>Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.4'>Then Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it's good that we're here! If you want, I will set up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.5'>He was still speaking when a bright cloud suddenly overshadowed them. A voice from the cloud said, “This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him. Keep on listening to him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.6'>When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.7'>But Jesus came up to them and touched them, saying,“Get up, and stop being afraid.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.8'>When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus all by himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.9'>On their way down the mountain, Jesus ordered them,“Don't tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.10'>So the disciples asked him, “Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.11'>He answered them,“Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.12'>But I tell you that Elijah has already come, yet peopledid not recognize him and treated him just as they pleased. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.13'>Then the disciples understood that he had been speaking to them about John the Baptist.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.14'>As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, knelt down in front of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.15'>and said, “Sir, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and suffers terribly. Often he falls into fire and often into water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.16'>I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.17'>Jesus replied,“You unbelieving and perverted generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.18'>Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed that very hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.19'>Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, “Why couldn't we drive it out?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.20'>He told them,“Because of your lack of faith.For truly I tell you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.21'>Butthis kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.22'>While they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus told them,“The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.23'>They will kill him, but he will be raised on the third day.”Then they were filled with grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.24'>When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came up to Peter and said, “Your teacher pays the temple tax, doesn't he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.25'>He answered, “Yes.”When Peter went home, Jesus spoke to him first, saying,“What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings on the earth collect tolls or tributes? From their own subjects,or from foreigners?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.26'>When he said, “From foreigners,” Jesus said to him,“In that case, the subjectsare exempt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.17.27'>However, so that we don't offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, open itsmouth, and you will find a coin.Take it and give it to them for me and you.”</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.2'>Calling a little child forward, he had him stand among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.3'>Then he said,“Truly I tell you, unless you changeand become like little children, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.4'>Therefore, whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.18.6'>“If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned at the bottom of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.7'>How terrible it will be for the world because it causes people to sin! Temptations to sin are bound to happen, but how terrible it will be for that person who causes someone to sin!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.18.8'>“So if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life injured or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.19.1'>When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.2'>Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.3'>Some Pharisees came to him in order to test him. They asked, “Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.4'>He answered them,“Haven't you read that the one who madethem at the beginning ‘made them male and female’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.5'>and said, ‘That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh’?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.6'>So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, man must never separate.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.7'>They asked him, “Why, then, did Moses order us ‘to give a certificate of divorce and divorce her’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.8'>He said to them,“It was because of your hardness of heart that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning it was not this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.9'>Itell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.10'>His disciples said to him, “If that is the relationship of a man with his wife, it's not worth getting married!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.11'>But he said to them,“Not everyone can accept this saying, except those to whom celibacyhas been granted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.12'>For some men are celibate from birth,while others are celibate because they have been made that way by others. Still others are celibate because they have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.13'>Then some little children were brought to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.14'>Jesus, however, said,“Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like these.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.15'>When he had laid his hands on them, he went on from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.16'>Just then a man came up to Jesus and said, “Teacher, what good deed should I do to have eternal life?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.17'>Jesus said to him,“Why ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good.If you want to get into that life, you must keep the commandments.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.18'>The young man said to him, “Which ones?”Jesus said,“‘You must not murder,you must not commit adultery,you must not steal,you must not give false testimony,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.19.25'>When the disciples heard this, they were completely astonished and said, “Who, then, can be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.26'>Jesus looked at them intently and said,“For humans this is impossible, but for God all things are possible.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.27'>Then Peter said to him, “See, we have left everything and followed you. So what will we get?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.28'>Jesus said to them,“Truly I tell you, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the renewed creation, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, governing the twelve tribes of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.19.29'>In fact, everyone who has left his homes, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or fields because of my name will receive a hundred times as muchand will inherit eternal life.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Matt.21'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.1'>When they came near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples on ahead and</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.2'>said to them,“Go into the village ahead of you. At once you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with it. Untie them, and bring them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.3'>If anyone says anything to you, tell him, ‘The Lord needs them,’ and that person will send them at once.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.4'>Now this happened to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet when he said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.5'>“Tell the daughter of Zion,‘Look, your king is coming to you!	He is humble and mounted on a donkey,even on a colt of a donkey.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.6'>So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.7'>They brought the donkey and the colt and put their coats on them, and he sat upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.8'>Many people in the crowd spread their own coats on the road, while others began cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.9'>Both the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed him kept shouting,	“Hosanna to the Son of David!	How blessed is the one who comesin the name of the Lord!	Hosanna in the highest heaven!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.10'>When he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was trembling with excitement. The people were asking, “Who is this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.11'>The crowds kept saying, “This is the prophet Jesus, the man from Nazareth in Galilee.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.12'>Then Jesus went into the temple, threw out all who were selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the moneychangers’ tables and the chairs of those who sold doves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.13'>He told them,“It is written, ‘My house is to be called a house of prayer,’but you are turning it into a hideoutfor bandits!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.14'>Blind and lame people came to him in the temple, and he healed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.15'>But when the high priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he had done and the children shouting in the temple, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” they became furious</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.16'>and asked him, “Do you hear what these people are saying?”Jesus said to them,“Yes! Haven't you ever read, ‘From the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have created praise’?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.17'>Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.18'>In the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, he became hungry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.19'>Seeing a fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it,“May fruit never come from you again!” And immediately the fig tree dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.20'>When the disciples saw this, they were amazed and said, “How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.21'>Jesus answered them,“Truly I tell you, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you be able to do what has been done to the fig tree, but you will also say to this mountain, ‘Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,’ and it will happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.22'>You will receive whatever you ask for in prayer, if you believe.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.23'>Then Jesus went into the temple. While he was teaching, the high priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, “By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.24'>Jesus answered them,“I, too, will ask you one question.If you answer it for me, I will also tell you by what authority I am doing these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.25'>Where did John's authority to baptizecome from? From heaven or from humans?”They began discussing this among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘Then why didn't you believe him?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.26'>But if we say, ‘From humans,’ we are afraid of the crowd, for all regard John as a prophet.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.27'>So they said to Jesus, “We don't know.”He in turn told them,“Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.28'>“But what do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, ‘Son, go and work in the vineyard today.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.21.30'>Then the fatherwent to the other sonand told him the same thing. He replied, ‘I will,sir,’ but he didn't go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.31'>Which of the two did the father's will?”They answered, “The first.”Jesus said to them,“Truly I tell you, tax collectors and prostitutes will get into God's kingdom ahead of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.32'>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, but you didn't believe him. The tax collectors and prostitutes believed him. But even when you saw that, you didn't change your mindsat last and believe him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.33'>“Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a wall around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.34'>When harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenant farmers to collect his produce.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.35'>But the farmers took his servants and beat one, killed another, and attacked another with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.36'>Again, he sent other servants to them, a greater number than the first, but the tenant farmerstreated them the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.37'>Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, ‘They will respect my son.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.38'>But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to one another, ‘This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him and get his inheritance!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.39'>So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.40'>Now when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those farmers?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.41'>They said to him, “He will put those horrible men to a horrible death. Then he will lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give him his produce at harvest time.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.21.42'>Jesus said to them,“Have you never read in the Scriptures,‘The stone that the builders rejectedhas become the cornerstone.	This was the Lord's doing,and it is amazing in our eyes’?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.1'>Again Jesus spoke to them in parables. He said,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.4'>Sohe sent other servants, saying, ‘Tell those who have been invited, “Look, I've prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened calves have been slaughtered. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding!”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.5'>But they paid no attention to this and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.6'>Therest grabbed theking'sservants, treated them brutally, and then killed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.7'>Then the king became outraged. He sent his troops, and they destroyed those murderers and burned their city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.8'>“Then he said to his servants, ‘The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.9'>So go into the roads leading out of town and invite as many people as you can find to the wedding.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.10'>Those servants went out into the streets and brought in all the people they found, evil and good alike, and the wedding hall was packed with guests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.11'>“When the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.13'>Then the king told his servants, ‘Tie his hands and feet, and throw him into the outer darkness! In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.14'>For many are invited, but few are chosen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.15'>Then the Pharisees went and planned how to trap Jesus in conversation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.16'>They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. They said, “Teacher, we know that you are sincere and that you teach the way of God truthfully. You don't favor any individual, for you pay no attention to external appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.17'>So tell us what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.18'>But Jesus recognized their wickedness and said,“Why are you testing me, you hypocrites?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.19'>Show me the coin used for the tax.”They brought him a denarius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.20'>Then he asked them,“Whose face and name is this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.21'>They said to him, “Caesar's.”So he said to them,“Then give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.22'>When they heard this, they were amazed. Then they left him and went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.23'>That same day some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.22.35'>One of them, an expert in the law, tested him by asking,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.36'>“Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.22.37'>Jesus said to him,“‘You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.’</verse>

        <verse osisID='Matt.26.18'>He said,“Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house.”’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.19'>So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.20'>When evening came, Jesus was sitting at the table with the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.21'>While they were eating, he said,“Truly I tell you, one of you is going to betray me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.22'>Feeling deeply distressed, each one began to say to him, “Surely I am not the one, Lord?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.23'>He replied,“The man who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.24'>The Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.25'>Then Judas, who was going to betray him, said, “Rabbi, I'm not the one, am I?”Jesus said to him,“You have said so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.26'>While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to the disciples, saying,“Take this and eat it. This is my body.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.27'>Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying,“Drink from it, all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.28'>For this is my blood of the newcovenant that is being poured out for many people for the forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.29'>I tell you, I will never again drink the product of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.30'>After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.31'>Then Jesus said to them,“All of you will turn against me this very night. For it is written,‘I will strike the shepherd,and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.32'>However, after I have been raised, I will go to Galilee ahead of you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.33'>But Peter said to him, “Even if everyone else turns against you, I certainly won't!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.34'>Jesus said to him,“Truly I tell you, this very night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.35'>Peter told him, “Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!” And all the disciples said the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.36'>Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane. He said to the disciples,“Sit down here while I go over there and pray.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.37'>Taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, he began to be grieved and troubled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.38'>Then he said to them,“My soul is deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake with me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.39'>Going on a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed,“O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not what I want but what you want.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.40'>When he went back to the disciples, he found them asleep. He said to Peter,“So, you mencouldn't stay awake with me for one hour, could you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.41'>All of youmust stay awake and pray that you won't come into temptation. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.42'>He went away a second time and prayed,“My Father, if this cannot go away unless I drink it, let your will be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.43'>Again he came back and found them asleep, for their eyes were very heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.44'>After leaving them again, he went away and prayed again for the third time, saying the same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.45'>Then he came back to the disciples and said to them,“You might as well keep on sleeping and resting.Look! The time is near for the Son of Man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.46'>Getup! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.47'>Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve, arrived. A large crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests and elders of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.48'>Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, “The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.49'>So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, “Hello, Rabbi!” and kissed him tenderly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.50'>Jesus said to him,“Friend, why are you here?” Then the other men came forward, took hold of Jesus, and arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.51'>Suddenly, one of the men with Jesus reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.52'>Jesus said to him,“Put your sword back in its place! For all who use a sword will be killed by a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.53'>Don't you think that I could call on my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels now?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.54'>How, then, would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.55'>At this point Jesus said to the crowds,“Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit?Day after day I sat teaching in the temple, yet you didn't arrest me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.56'>But all of this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.”Then all the disciples deserted him and ran away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.57'>Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.58'>Peter, however, followed him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He went inside and sat down with the servants to see how this would end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.59'>Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.60'>But they couldn't find any, even though many false witnesses had come forward. At last two men came forward</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.61'>and stated, “This man said, ‘I can destroy the sanctuary of God and rebuild it in three days.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.62'>At this, the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, “Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.63'>But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, “I command you by the living God to tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.64'>Jesus said to him,“You have said so. Nevertheless I tell you,from now on‘you will see ‘the Son of Manseated at the right hand of Power’and‘coming on the clouds of heaven.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.65'>Then the high priest tore his robes and said, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Look, you yourselves have just heard the blasphemy!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.66'>What is your verdict?”They replied, “He deserves to die!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.67'>Then they spit in his face and hit him. Some slapped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.68'>saying, “Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is the one who hit you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.69'>Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, “You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.70'>But he denied it in front of them all, saying, “I don't know what you're talking about.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.71'>As he went out to the gateway, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, “This man was with Jesus from Nazareth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.72'>Again he denied it and swore with an oath, “I don't know the man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.73'>After a little while the people who were standing there came up and said to Peter, “Obviously you're also one of them, because your accent gives you away.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.74'>Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, “I don't know the man!” Just then a rooster crowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.26.75'>Peter remembered the words of Jesus when he said,“Before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.” Then he went outside and cried bitterly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.27'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.1'>When morning came, all the high priests and the elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put him to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.2'>They bound him with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.3'>Then Judas, who had betrayed him, regretted what had happened when he saw that Jesus was condemned. He brought the thirty pieces of silver back to the high priests and elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.4'>saying, “I have sinned by betraying innocent blood.”But they said, “What do we care? See to that yourself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.5'>Then he flung the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and went outside. Then he went away and hanged himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.6'>The high priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, “It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, because it is blood money.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.7'>So they decided to use the money to buy the Potter's Field as a burial ground for foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.8'>That is why that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.9'>Then what had been declared through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,	“They took the thirty pieces of silver,the value of the man on whom a price had been set by the Israelites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.10'>and they gave them for the potter's field,as the Lord commanded me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.11'>Meanwhile, Jesus was made to stand in front of the governor. The governor asked him, “Are you the king of the Jews?”Jesus said,“You say so.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.12'>While Jesus was being accused by the high priests and elders, he made no reply.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.13'>Then Pilate said to him, “Don't you hear how many charges they're bringing against you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.14'>But Jesus did not reply at all, so that the governor was very surprised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.15'>At every festival the governor had a custom of releasing to the crowd any prisoner whom they wanted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.16'>At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.17'>So when the people had gathered, Pilate asked them, “Which man do you want me to release for you—Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Christ?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.18'>For he knew that they had handed him over because of jealousy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.19'>While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message. It said, “Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for today I have suffered terribly because of a dream about him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.20'>But the high priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to demand that Jesus be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.21'>So the governor said to them, “Which of the two men do you want me to release for you?”They said, “Barabbas!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.22'>Pilate said to them, “Then what should I do with Jesus, who is called the Christ?”They all said, “Let him be crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.23'>He asked, “What has he done wrong?”But they kept shouting louder and louder, “Let him be crucified!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.24'>Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was about to break out instead. So he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, “I am innocent of this man's blood. You must see to that yourselves.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.25'>All the people answered, “Let his blood be on us and our children!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.26'>Then he released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.27'>Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the imperial headquarters and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.28'>They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.29'>Twisting some thorns into a victor's crown, they placed it on his head and put a stick in his right hand. They knelt down in front of him and began making fun of him, saying, “Long live the king of the Jews!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.30'>Then they spit on him and took the stick and hit him repeatedly on his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.31'>When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.32'>As they were leaving, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry Jesus’ cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.33'>When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means “Skull Place”),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.34'>they offered him a drink of wine mixed with gall. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.35'>After they had crucified him, they divided his clothes by throwing dice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.36'>Then they sat down there and continued guarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.37'>Above his head they placed the charge against him. It read, “This is Jesus, the king of the Jews.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.38'>At that time two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.39'>Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.40'>and saying, “You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days—save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.41'>In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes and elders, were also making fun of him. They kept saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.42'>“He saved others but can't save himself! He is the king of Israel. Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.43'>He trusts in God. Let God rescue him now if he cares for him. After all, he said,‘I am the Son of God,’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.44'>Even the bandits who were crucified with him kept insulting him in the same way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.45'>Now from noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.46'>About three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice,“Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?”, which means,“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.47'>When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, “He's calling for Elijah.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.48'>So one of the men at once ran off, took a sponge, and soaked it in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.49'>But the others kept saying, “Wait! Let's see if Elijah will come and save him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.50'>Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice again and gave up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.51'>Suddenly the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, the rocks were split open,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.52'>the tombs were opened, and the bodies of many saints who had died were raised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.53'>After his resurrection, they came out of their tombs and went into the Holy City and appeared to many people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.54'>When the centurion and those guarding Jesus with him saw the earthquake and the other things that were taking place, they were terrified and said, “This man certainly was the Son of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.55'>Now many women were also there, watching from a distance. They had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.56'>Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.57'>When evening came, a rich man arrived from Arimathea. His name was Joseph, and he had become a disciple of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.58'>He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be handed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.59'>So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.60'>Then he placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. After rolling a large stone across the door of the tomb, he went away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.61'>But Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained there, sitting in front of the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.62'>The next day (which is after the Day of Preparation), the high priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.63'>and said, “Sir, we remember how that impostor said while he was still alive,‘After three days I will be raised.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.64'>Therefore, order the tomb to be secured until the third day, or his disciples may go and steal him and then tell the people, ‘He has been raised from the dead.’ Then the last deception would be worse than the first one.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.65'>Pilate told them, “You have a military guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.27.66'>So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Matt.28'>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.1'>After the Sabbath, around dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to take a look at the tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.2'>Suddenly there was a powerful earthquake. For an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, stepped forward, rolled the stone away, and was sitting on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.3'>His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were as white as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.4'>Because they were so afraid of him, the guards shook and became like dead men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.5'>But the angel said to the women, “Stop being afraid! For I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.6'>He is not here. He has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.7'>Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee, and you will see him there. Remember, I have told you!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.8'>So they quickly left the tomb with fear and great joy and ran to tell his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.9'>Suddenly Jesus met them and said,“Greetings!” They went up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.10'>Then Jesus said to them,“Stop being afraid! Go and tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and there they will see me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.11'>While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the high priests all that had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.12'>So they met with the elders and agreed on a plan to give the soldiers a large amount of money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.13'>They said, “Say that his disciples came at night and stole him while you were sleeping.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.14'>If this is reported to the governor, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.15'>So the soldiers took the money and did as they were instructed. This story has been spread among the Jews to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.16'>The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the hillside to which Jesus had directed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.17'>When they saw him, they worshiped him, though some had doubts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.18'>Then Jesus came up and said to them,“All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.19'>Therefore, as you go, disciple all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Matt.28.20'>teaching them to obey all that I have commanded you. And remember, I am with you each and every dayuntil the end of the age.”</verse>
