  <div type='book' osisID='Titus'>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.1'>
        <title>so that the man of God may be complete and thoroughly equipped for every good work.</title>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.1'>From Paul, a servant of God, and yet an apostle of Jesus Christ for the faith of God's elect and the full knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.2'>which is based on the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.3'>At the right time he revealed his message through the proclamation that was entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.4'>To Titus, a genuine child in the faith we share. May grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior be yours!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.5'>The reason I left you in Crete was to complete what still needed to be done and to appoint elders in every city, as I myself commanded you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.6'>An elder must be blameless. He must be the husband of one wife and have children who are believers and who are not accused of having wild lifestyles or of being rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.7'>Because an overseer is God's administrator, he must be blameless. He must not be arrogant or irritable. He must not drink too much, be a violent person, or use shameful ways to make money.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.8'>Instead, he must be a lover of strangers, a lover of goodness, sensible, honest, moral, and self-controlled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.9'>He must be devoted to the trustworthy message that is in agreement with our teaching, so that he may be able to encourage others with healthy doctrine and refute those who oppose it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.10'>For there are many people who are rebellious, especially those who are converts from Judaism. They speak utter nonsense and deceive people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.11'>They must be silenced, because they are the kind of people who ruin whole families by teaching what they should not teach in order to make money in a shameful way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.12'>One of their very own prophets said,	“Liars ever, men of Crete,Savage brutes that live to eat.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.13'>That testimony is true. For this reason, refute them sharply so that they may become healthy in the faith</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.14'>and not pay attention to Jewish myths or commands given by people who reject the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.15'>Everything is clean to those who are clean, but nothing is clean to those who are corrupt and unbelieving. Indeed, their very way of thinking and their consciences have been corrupted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.1.16'>They claim to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified to do anything good.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.2'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.1'>But as for you, teach what is consistent with healthy doctrine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.2'>Older men are to be sober, serious, sensible, and sound in faithfulness, love, and endurance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.3'>Likewise, older women are to show their reverence for God by their behavior. They are not to be gossips or addicted to alcohol, but to be examples of goodness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.4'>They should encourage the younger women to be lovers of their husbands, lovers of their children,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.5'>sensible, pure, managers of their households, and kind, and to submit themselves to their husbands, lest the word of God be discredited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.6'>Likewise, encourage the younger men to be sensible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.7'>Always set an example of good works. When you teach, show integrity and dignity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.8'>Use wholesome speech that cannot be condemned. Then any opponent will be ashamed because he cannot say anything bad about us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.9'>Slaves are to submit themselves to their masters in everything, aiming to please them and not argue with them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.10'>or steal from them. Instead, they are to show complete and perfect loyalty, so that in every way they may make the teaching about God our Savior more attractive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.11'>For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.12'>It trains us to renounce ungodly living and worldly passions so that we might live sensible, honest, and godly lives in the present world</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.13'>as we wait for the blessed hope and the glorious appearance of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.14'>He gave himself for us to set us free from every wrong and to cleanse us so that we could be his special people who are enthusiastic about good works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.2.15'>These are the things you should say. Encourage and refute with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Titus.3'>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.1'>Remind believers to submit themselves to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready to do any honorable kind of work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.2'>They are not to insult anyone or be argumentative. Instead, they are to be gentle and show perfect courtesy to everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.3'>After all, we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, and misled. We were slaves to many kinds of lusts and pleasures, spending our days in malice and jealousy. We were despised, and we hated one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.4'>However,	In grace our Savior God appeared,His love for mankind to make clear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.5'>‘Twas not for deeds that we had done, But by his steadfast love alone,	He saved us through a second birth,Renewed us by the Spirit's work,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.6'>And poured him out upon us, too,Through Jesus Christ our Savior true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.7'>And so, made right by his own grace,Eternal life we now embrace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.8'>This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have put their faith in God may devote themselves to good works. These things are good and helpful to other people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.9'>But avoid foolish controversies, arguments about genealogies, quarrels, and fights about the law. These things are useless and worthless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.10'>Have nothing to do with a person who causes divisions after you have warned him once or twice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.11'>For you know that a person like this is corrupt and keeps on sinning, being self-condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.12'>As soon as I send Artemas to you, or perhaps Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.13'>Do all you can to send Zenas the expert in the law and Apollos on their way, and see that they have everything they need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.14'>Our own people should also learn to devote themselves to good works when urgent needs arise, lest they be unproductive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Titus.3.15'>All who are with me send you greetings. Greet those who love us in the faith. May grace be with all of you! Amen.</verse>
