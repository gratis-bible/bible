      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <title>But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that through believing you may have life in his name.</title>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>In my first book, Theophilus, I wrote about everything Jesus did and taught from the beginning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>up to the day when he was taken up to heaven after giving orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>After he had suffered, he had shown himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them through a period of forty days and telling them about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>While he was meeting with them, he ordered them,“Do not leave Jerusalem, but wait for the Father's promise, about which you heard me speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>ForJohn baptized withwater, but you will be baptized withthe Holy Spirit not many days from now.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>Now those who had come together began to ask him, “Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He answered them,“It is not for you to know what times or periods the Father has set by his own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>After saying this, he was taken up while they were watching, and a cloud took him out of their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, two men in white robes were standing right beside them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>They asked, “Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go up into heaven.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>When they came into the city, they went to the upstairs room where they had been staying. They were Peter and John; James and Andrew; Philip and Thomas; Bartholomew and Matthew; James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot; and Judas the son of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>With one mind all of them kept devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>At that time Peter got up among the brothers (there were about 120 people present) and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>“Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the voice of David about Judas, who was the guide to those who arrested Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>For he was one of our number and was chosen to share in this ministry.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>(Now this man bought a field with the money he got for his crime. Falling on his face, he burst open in the middle, and all his intestines gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that this field is called in their language Hakeldama, that is, “The Field of Blood”.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>“For in the Book of Psalms it is written,	‘Let his estate be desolate, and let no one live on it,’and	‘Let someone else take over his office.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>Therefore, one of the men who has associated with us all the time the Lord Jesus came and went among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning with the baptism of John until the day he was taken up from us, must become a witness with us to his resurrection.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>So they nominated two men—Joseph called Barsabbas, who also was called Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>Then they prayed, “Lord, you know the hearts of all people. Show us which one of these two men you have chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to serve in this office of apostle, from which Judas fell away to go to his own place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>So they drew lots for them, and when the lot fell on Matthias, he was added to the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>When the day of Pentecost came, all of them were together in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>Suddenly, a sound like the roaring of a mighty windstorm came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated, and one rested on each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them that ability.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now devout Jews from every nation under heaven were living in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>When that sound came, the crowd rushed together and was startled because each one heard the disciples speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>Stunned and amazed, they asked, “All of these people who are speaking are Galileans, aren't they?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>So how is it that each one of us hears them speaking in his own native language?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>We are Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the district of Libya near Cyrene, and visitors from Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>We are Jews, proselytes, Cretans, and Arabs. Yet we hear them telling in our own tongues the great deeds of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>All of them continued to be stunned and puzzled, and they kept asking one another, “What can this mean?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others kept saying in derision, “They're full of sweet wine!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Then Peter stood up with the eleven, raised his voice, and addressed them, “Men of Judea and everyone living in Jerusalem! You must understand something, so pay close attention to my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>These men are not drunk as you suppose, for it's only nine o'clock in the morning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>Rather, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>‘In the last days, God says,I will pour out my Spirit on everyone.	Your sons and your daughters will prophesy,your young men will see visions,and your old men will dream dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>In those days I will even pour out my Spiriton my slaves, men and women alike,and they will prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>I will work wonders in the sky aboveand signs on the earth below:blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun will turn to darkness,and the moon to blood,before the coming of the great and glorious Day of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>Then whoever calls on the name of the Lordwill be saved.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>“Fellow Israelites, listen to these words! Jesus from Nazareth was a man accredited to you by God through miracles, wonders, and signs that God performed through him among you, as you yourselves know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>This very man, after he was arrested according to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>But God raised him up and destroyed the pains of death, since it was impossible for him to be held in its power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David says about him,	‘I always see the Lord in front of me,for he is at my right handso that I cannot be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>That is why my heart is gladand my tongue rejoices,yes, even my body still rests securely in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>For you will not abandon my soul to Hadesor allow your Holy One to experience decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>You have made the ways of life known to me,and you will fill me with gladness in your presence.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>“Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and that his tomb is among us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him with an oath to put one of his descendants on his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>he looked ahead and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ:	‘He was not abandoned to Hades,and his flesh did not experience decay.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>It was this very Jesus whom God raised, and of that we are all witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>He has been exalted to the right hand of God, has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, and has poured out what you are seeing and hearing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David did not go up to heaven, but he said,	‘The Lord said to my Lord,“Sit at my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>until I make your enemies your footstool.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Therefore, let the entire house of Israel understand beyond a doubt that God made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Christ!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>When they heard this, they were pierced to the heart. They asked Peter and the other apostles, “Brothers, what should we do?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Peter answered them, “Repent and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit as a gift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For this promise belongs to you and your children, as well as to all those who are far away, whom the Lord our God may call to himself.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>With many more words he continued to testify and to plead with them, saying, “Be saved from this corrupt generation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>So those who welcomed his message were baptized, and that day about 3,000 persons were added to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>They continually devoted themselves to the teaching of the apostles, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to times of prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>A sense of fear came over everyone, and many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>All the believers were together, and they shared everything with one another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>They made it their practice to sell their possessions and goods and to distribute the proceeds to anyone who was in need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>They had a single purpose and went to the temple every day. They ate at each other's homes and shared their food with glad and humble hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>They kept praising God and enjoying the good will of all the people. And every day the Lord was adding to them people who were being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Peter and John were going up to the temple for the hour of prayer at three in the afternoon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>Now a man who had been crippled from birth was being carried in. Every day people would lay him at what was called the Beautiful Gate so that he could beg from those who were going into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>When he saw that Peter and John were about to go into the temple, he asked them to give him something.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Peter, along with John, looked him straight in the eye and said, “Look at us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>So the man watched them closely, expecting to get something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>However, Peter said, “I don't have any silver or gold, but I'll give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus Christ from Nazareth, walk!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>Then Peter took hold of his right hand and began to help him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>and he sprung to his feet, stood up, and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple, walking, jumping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>When all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>they knew that he was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>While he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people came running together to them in what was called Solomon's Colonnade. They were dumbfounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>When Peter saw this, he said to the people: “Fellow Israelites, why are you wondering about this, and why are you staring at us as if by our own power or godliness we made him walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob—the God of our ancestors—has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and rejected in the presence of Pilate, even though he had decided to let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer given to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>and you killed the source of life, whom God raised from the dead. We are witnesses to that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>It is his name, that is, by the faith of his name, that has healed this man whom you see and know. Yes, the faith that comes through him has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>“And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance like your leaders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>This is how God fulfilled what he had predicted through the voice of all the prophets—that his Christ would suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Therefore, repent and turn to him to have your sins blotted out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord and so that he may send you Jesus, the Christ whom he appointed long ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>Heaven must receive him until the time of universal restoration that God announced long ago through the voice of his holy prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>In fact, Moses said,‘The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to everything he tells you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>Any person who will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>“Indeed, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who followed him, also predicted these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>You are the descendants of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant that God made with your ancestors when he said to Abraham, ‘Through your descendant all the families of the earth will be blessed.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning every one of you from your evil ways.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the commander of the temple guards, and the Sadducees came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>They were greatly disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people and declaring that in the case of Jesus there had been a resurrection from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>So they arrested them and placed them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who heard their message believed, and the number of men grew to about 5,000.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes met in Jerusalem</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the rest of the high priest's family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>They made them stand in front of them and began asking, “By what power or by what name did you do this?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, “Rulers and elders of the people!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>If we are being questioned today for a good deed to someone who was sick or to learn how this man was healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>you and all the people of Israel must understand that this man stands healthy before you because of the name of Jesus from Nazareth, whom you crucified but God raised from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>He is	‘the stone that was rejected by you builders,which has become the cornerstone.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>There is no salvation by anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John and found out that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and realized that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could not say anything against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>So they ordered them to leave the Council and began to discuss the matter among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>They said, “What should we do with these men? For it's obvious to everybody living in Jerusalem that an unmistakable sign has been done by them, and we can't deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But to keep it from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them never again to speak to anyone in this name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>So they called them in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John answered them, “You must decide whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>for we cannot stop talking about what we have seen and heard.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>So they threatened them even more and then let them go. They couldn't find any way to punish them, because all the people continued to praise God for what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than forty years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>After they were released, they went to their own people and told them everything the high priests and the elders had said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>When they heard this, they all raised their voices to God and said, “Master, you made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>You said by the Holy Spirit through the voice of our ancestor, your servant David,	‘Why do the Gentiles rage,and the people devise useless plots?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth take their stand,and rulers meet together against the Lordand against his Christ.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>“For in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate actually met together with the Gentiles and the people of Israel against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do all that your hand and your will had predetermined to take place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>Lord, pay attention to their threats now, and allow your servants to speak your word with all boldness</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>as you stretch out your hand to heal and to perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>When they had prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>Now the whole group of believers was one in heart and soul, and nobody called any of his possessions his own. Instead, they shared everything they owned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was on them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>For none of them needed anything, because all who had land or houses would sell them and bring the money received for the things sold</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and lay it at the apostles’ feet. Then it was distributed to anyone who needed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>Now Joseph, a Levite and a native of Cyprus, who was named Barnabas by the apostles (the name means “a son of encouragement”),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a man named Ananias, with the consent of his wife Sapphira, sold some property.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>With his wife's full knowledge he kept back some of the money for himself and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles’ feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>Peter asked, “Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that you should lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back some of the money you got for the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>As long as it remained unsold, wasn't it your own? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? So how could you have conceived such a thing in your heart? You did not lie to men but to God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.5'>When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear seized everyone who heard about it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.6'>The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him outside, and buried him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.7'>After an interval of about three hours, his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.8'>So Peter asked her, “Tell me, did you sell the land for that price?”She answered, “Yes, that was the price.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.9'>Then Peter said to her, “How could you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you outside as well.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.10'>She instantly fell down at his feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead. So they carried her out and buried her next to her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.11'>And great fear seized the whole church and everyone else who heard about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.12'>Now many signs and wonders were continuously being performed by the apostles among the people. And they were all together in Solomon's Colonnade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.13'>None of the other people dared to join them, although the people continued to hold them in high regard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.14'>Nevertheless, still more believers, a vast number of both men and women, were being added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.15'>As a result, people kept carrying their sick into the streets and placing them on stretchers and cots so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he went by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.16'>Even from the towns around Jerusalem crowds continued coming in to bring their sick and those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.17'>Then the high priest and all those from the sect of the Sadducees who were with him were filled with jealousy. So they went out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.18'>arrested the apostles, and put them in the city jail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.19'>But at night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and led them out. He told them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.20'>“Go and stand in the temple and keep on telling the people the whole message about this life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.21'>After they heard this, they went into the temple at daybreak and began to teach. The high priest and those who were with him arrived, called the Council and all the elders of Israel together, and sent word to the prison to have the men brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.22'>When the temple police got there, they did not find them in the prison. They came back and reported,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>“We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>When the commander of the temple guards and the high priests heard these words, they were utterly at a loss as to what could have happened to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.25'>Then someone came and told them, “Look! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.26'>So the commander of the temple guards went with his men to bring them back without force, because they were afraid of being stoned to death by the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.27'>When they brought them back, they made them stand before the Council, and the high priest began to question them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.28'>He said, “We gave you strict orders not to teach in his name, didn't we? Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to bring this man's blood on us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.29'>But Peter and the apostles answered, “We must obey God rather than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.30'>The God of our ancestors raised Jesus to life after you hung him on a tree and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.31'>God has exalted to his right hand this very man as our Leader and Savior in order to give repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.32'>We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who keep on obeying him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.33'>When they heard this, they became furious and wanted to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.34'>But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.35'>Then he said to them, “Fellow Israelites, consider carefully what you propose to do to these men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.36'>For in days gone by Theudas appeared, claiming that he was important, and about 400 men joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and disappeared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.37'>After that man, at the time of the census, Judas the Galilean appeared and got people to follow him. He, too, died, and all his followers were scattered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.38'>“I'm telling you to keep away from these men for now. Leave them alone, because if this plan or movement is of human origin, it will fail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.39'>However, if it is from God, you won't be able to stop them, and you may even discover that you are fighting against God!” So they were convinced by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.40'>After calling in the apostles and beating them, they ordered them to stop speaking in the name of Jesus and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.41'>They left the Council, rejoicing to have been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the Name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.42'>Every day in the temple and from house to house they kept teaching and proclaiming that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.6'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.1'>In those days, as the number of the disciples was growing larger and larger, a complaint was made by the Hellenistic Jews against the Hebraic Jews that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.2'>So the twelve called the whole group of disciples together and said, “It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.3'>Therefore, brothers, appoint seven men among you who have a good reputation, who are full of the Spirit and wisdom, and we will put them in charge of this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.4'>Then we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.5'>This suggestion pleased the whole group. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a Gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.6'>They had these men stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.7'>So the word of God continued to spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem continued to grow rapidly. Even a large number of priests became obedient to the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.8'>Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.9'>But some men who belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), as well as some Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and began to debate with Stephen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.10'>But they couldn't resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he kept speaking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.11'>So they secretly got some men to say, “We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.12'>They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes. Then they rushed at him, grabbed him, and brought him before the Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.13'>They had false witnesses stand up and say, “This man never stops saying things against this Holy Place and against the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.14'>For we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.6.15'>Then all who were seated in the Council glared at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.7'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.1'>Then the high priest asked, “Is this true?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.2'>Stephen replied, “Listen, brothers and fathers! The glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.3'>He said to him, ‘Leave your country and your relatives and go to the land I will show you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.4'>So he left the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. Then after the death of his father, God had him move to this country where you now live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.5'>He gave him no property in it, not even a foot of land, yet he promised to give it to him and his descendants after him as a permanent possession, even though he had no child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.6'>This is what God promised: His descendants would be strangers in a foreign country, and its people would enslave them and oppress them for 400 years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.7'>‘But I will punish the nation they serve,’ said God, ‘and afterwards they will leave and worship me in this place.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.8'>Then he gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision, and he became the father of Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Then Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.9'>“The patriarchs became jealous of Joseph and sold him as a slave into Egypt. However, God was with him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.10'>and rescued him from all his troubles. He allowed him to win favor and show wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler of Egypt and of his whole household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.11'>“But a famine spread throughout Egypt and Canaan, and with it great suffering, and our ancestors couldn't find any food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.12'>But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors on their first visit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.13'>On their second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.14'>Then Joseph sent word and invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him—seventy-five persons in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.15'>So Jacob went down to Egypt. Then he and our ancestors died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.16'>They were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of money from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.17'>“Now as the time approached for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people multiplied and grew more numerous in Egypt,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.18'>until another king, who had not known Joseph, became ruler of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.19'>By shrewdly scheming against our people, he oppressed our ancestors and forced them to expose their infants so that they wouldn't live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.20'>“At this time Moses was born. He was beautiful in the sight of God, and for three months he was cared for in his father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.21'>When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.22'>So Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became a great man in speech and action.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.23'>“When he was forty years old, his heart was moved to visit his brothers, the descendants of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.24'>Because he saw one of them being mistreated, he defended and avenged the man who was being mistreated by striking down the Egyptian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.25'>He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was using him to rescue them, but they didn't understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.26'>The next day he showed himself to some of them while they were fighting and tried to reconcile them, saying, ‘Men, you are brothers. Why should you harm each other?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.27'>But the man who was harming his neighbor pushed Moses away and said, ‘Who made you ruler and judge over us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.28'>You don't want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.29'>At this statement Moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midian. There he had two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.30'>“When forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.31'>When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and when he approached to look at it, the voice of the Lord said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.32'>‘I am the God of your ancestors—the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.’ Moses became terrified and didn't dare to look.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.33'>Then the Lord said to him, ‘Take your shoes off your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.34'>I have surely seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groans, and I have come down to rescue them. Now come, I will send you to Egypt.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.35'>“This same Moses, whom they rejected by saying ‘Who made you ruler and judge?’, was the man whom God sent to be both their ruler and deliverer with the help of the angel who had appeared to him in the bush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.36'>It was he who led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.37'>It was this Moses who told the Israelites, ‘God will raise up a prophet for you from among your own brothers, just as he did me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.38'>This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and with our ancestors. He received living truths to give to us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.39'>but our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and in their hearts turned back to Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.40'>They said to Aaron, ‘Make gods for us who will lead us. This Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt—we don't know what happened to him!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.41'>In those days they even made a calf, offered a sacrifice to their idol, and delighted in the works of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.42'>“So God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the heavenly bodies. As it is written in the book of the Prophets:	‘O house of Israel,you didn't offer me slaughtered animals andsacrifices those forty years in the wilderness, did you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.43'>You even took along the tent of Moloch,the star of your god Rephan,	and the images you made in order to worship them.So I will remove you beyond Babylon.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.44'>“Our ancestors had the Tent of Testimony in the wilderness constructed, just as the one who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.45'>Our ancestors brought it here with Joshua when they replaced the nations that God drove out before our ancestors, and it was here until the time of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.46'>He found favor with God and asked to design a dwelling for the house of Jacob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.47'>but it was Solomon who built a house for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.48'>However, the Most High does not live in buildings made by human hands. As the prophet says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.49'>“‘Heaven is my throne,and the earth is my footstool.	What kind of house can you build for me,’ declares the Lord, “or what place is there in which I can rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.50'>It was my hand that made all these things, wasn't it?’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.51'>“You stubborn people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.52'>Which of the prophets did your ancestors fail to persecute? They killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.53'>You received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you didn't obey it!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.54'>While they were listening to these things, they became more and more furious and began to grind their teeth at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.55'>But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.56'>He said, “Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.57'>But they raised a loud shout, held their ears shut, and together they all rushed at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.58'>They threw him out of the city and began to stone him to death. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.59'>As they continued to stone Stephen, he kept praying, “Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.7.60'>Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, “Lord, don't hold this sin against them!” When he had said this, he died.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.8'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.1'>Now Saul heartily approved of putting him to death. That day a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and all of them, except for the apostles, were scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.2'>Devout men buried Stephen as they mourned loudly for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.3'>But Saul kept trying to destroy the church. Going into one house after another, he began dragging off men and women and throwing them in prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.4'>Now those who were scattered went from place to place preaching the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.5'>Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Christ to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.6'>The crowds, hearing his message and seeing the signs that he was doing, paid close attention to what was said by Philip.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.7'>Unclean spirits screamed with a loud voice as they came out of the many people they had possessed, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.8'>As a result, there was great rejoicing in that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.9'>Now in that city there was a man named Simon. He was practicing occult arts and thrilling the people of Samaria, claiming to be a great man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.10'>Everyone from the least to the greatest paid close attention to him, saying, “This man is the power of God, which is called great!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.11'>They paid careful attention to him because he had thrilled them for a long time with his occultic performances.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.12'>But when Philip proclaimed the good news of the kingdom of God and of the name of Jesus Christ, men and women believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.13'>Even Simon believed, and after he was baptized he became devoted to Philip. He was amazed to see the signs and great miracles that were happening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.14'>Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaria had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.15'>They went down and prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.16'>Before this he had not come on any of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.17'>Then they laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.18'>Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles’ hands, he offered them money</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.19'>and said, “Give me this power too, so that when I lay my hands on someone he will receive the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.20'>But Peter said to him, “May your money perish with you because you thought you could obtain God's free gift with money!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.21'>You have no part or share in this matter, because your heart isn't right before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.22'>So repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, this thought of your heart may be forgiven you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.23'>For I see that you're turning into bitter poison and that you’re being chained by wickedness!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.24'>Simon answered, “Both of you pray to the Lord for me that none of the things you have said will happen to me.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.25'>After they had given their testimony and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, continuing to proclaim the good news in many Samaritan villages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.26'>Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, “Get up and go south by the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert road.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.27'>So he got up and went. Now an Ethiopian eunuch was there. He was a member of the court of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, and was in charge of all her treasures. He had come to Jerusalem to worship</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.28'>and was returning home. He was seated in his chariot, reading the prophet Isaiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.29'>The Spirit said to Philip, “Go to that chariot and stay close to it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.30'>So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah out loud.He asked, “Do you understand what you're reading?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.31'>He replied, “How can I unless someone guides me?” So he invited Philip to get in and sit with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.32'>This was the passage of Scripture he was reading:	“Like a sheep he was led away to be slaughtered,and like a lamb is silent before its shearer,so he does not open his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.33'>In his humiliation, justice was denied him.Who can describe his generation?For his life is taken away from the earth.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.34'>The eunuch said to Philip, “I ask you, about whom is the prophet speaking—about himself or about someone else?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.35'>Then Philip opened his mouth and, starting from this Scripture, told him the good news about Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.36'>As they were going along the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, “Look, there's some water. What keeps me from being baptized?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.38'>So he ordered the chariot to stop, and Philip and the eunuch both went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.39'>When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch went on his way rejoicing and did not see Philip again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.40'>But Philip found himself at Azotus. As he was passing through the region, he kept proclaiming the good news in all the towns until he came to Caesarea.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.9'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.1'>Now Saul, still breathing threats of murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>and asked him for letters to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>As he traveled along and was approaching Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly flashed around him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>He dropped to the ground and heard a voice saying to him,“Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>He asked, “Who are you, Lord?”He said,“I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>But get up and go into the city, and it will be told you what you are to do.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>Meanwhile, the men who were traveling with him were standing speechless, for they heard the voice but didn't see anyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>When Saul got up off the ground, he couldn't see anything, even though his eyes were open. So they took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>For three days he couldn't see, and he didn't eat or drink anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>Now in Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision,“Ananias!”He answered, “Here I am, Lord.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>The Lord said to him,“Get up, go to the street called Straight, and in the home of Judas look for a man from Tarsus named Saul. At this very moment he is praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>He has seen in a visiona man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so he would see again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>But Ananias answered, “Lord, I have heard many people tell how much evil this man has done to your saints in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>He is here with authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call on your name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said to him,“Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name to the Gentiles and their kings and to the descendants of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I am going to show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>So Ananias left and went to that house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, “Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were traveling, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>All at once something like scales fell from his eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>and after taking some food he felt strong again. For several days he stayed with the disciples in Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>He immediately started to proclaim Jesus in the synagogues, saying, “This is the Son of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>All who heard him were astonished and said, “This is the man who harassed those who called on his name in Jerusalem, isn't it? Didn't he come here to bring them in chains to the high priests?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul grew more and more powerful and continued to confound the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this man was the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>After several days had gone by, the Jews plotted to murder him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>but their plot became known to Saul. They were even watching the gates day and night to murder him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>but his disciples took him one night and let him down through the wall by lowering him in a basket.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>When he arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they all were afraid of him because they wouldn't believe he was a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>Barnabas, however, took him and presented him to the apostles, telling them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in the name of Jesus in Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>So he went in and out among them in Jerusalem, speaking courageously in the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>He kept talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews, but they were bent on murdering him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>When the brothers found out about it, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>So the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed peace. As it continued to be built up and to live in the fear of the Lord, it kept increasing in numbers through the encouragement of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>Now when Peter was going around among all of the disciples, he also came down to the saints living in Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>There he found a man named Aeneas who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>Peter said to him, “Aeneas, Jesus Christ is healing you. Get up and put away your bed!” At once he got up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>and all the people who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity, which she was always doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>At that time she got sick and died. When they had washed her, they laid her in an upstairs room.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>As Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to him and begged him, “Come to us without delay!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him upstairs. All the widows stood around him, crying and showing him all the shirts and coats Dorcas made while she was still with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Peter made them all go outside. After he knelt down and prayed, he turned to the body and said, “Tabitha, get up!” She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then he called the saints and widows and gave her back to them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>This became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>Meanwhile, Peter stayed in Joppa for several days with Simon, a leatherworker.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>Now in Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>He was a devout man who feared God, as did everyone in his home. He gave many gifts to the poor among the people and always prayed to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>One day about three in the afternoon he had a vision and clearly saw an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, “Cornelius!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>He stared at the angel in terror and asked, “What is it, Lord?”He answered him, “Your prayers and your gifts to the poor have come up as a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>Send men now to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>He is a guest of Simon, a leatherworker, whose house is by the sea.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>When the angel who had spoken to him had gone, Cornelius summoned two of his household servants and a devout soldier, one of those who served him regularly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>He explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>Around noon the next day, while they were on their way and coming close to the town, Peter went up on the roof to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>He became very hungry and wanted to eat, and while the food was being prepared, he fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>and saw heaven open and something like a large linen sheet coming down, being lowered by its four corners to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>In it were all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>Then a voice told him,“Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat it.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, “Absolutely not, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>Again a voice came to him a second time,“You must stop calling unclean what God has made clean.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>This happened three times. Then the sheet was quickly taken into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>While Peter was still at a loss to know what the vision he had seen could mean, the men sent by Cornelius asked for Simon's house and went to the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>They called out and asked if Simon who was called Peter was staying there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>Peter was still thinking about the vision when the Spirit said to him, “Look! Three men are looking for you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>Get up, go downstairs, and don't hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>So Peter went to the men and said, “I'm the man you're looking for. Why are you here?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>The men replied, “Cornelius, a centurion and an upright and God-fearing man who is respected by the whole Jewish nation, was instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his home to hear what you have to say.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>So Peter invited them in, and they were his guests. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>The next day they arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called his relatives and close friends together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>When Peter was about to go in, Cornelius met him, bowed down at his feet, and began to worship him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter made him get up, saying, “Stand up! I, too, am only a man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>As Peter talked with him, he went in and found that many people had gathered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>He said to them, “You understand how wrong it is for a Jew to associate or visit with a Gentile. But God has shown me that I should stop calling anyone common or unclean,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>and that is why I didn't hesitate when I was sent for. Now may I ask why you sent for me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>Cornelius replied, “Four days ago at this very hour, three o'clock in the afternoon, I was praying in my home. All at once a man in radiant clothes stood in front of me</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>and said, ‘Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your gifts to the poor have been remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>So send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter, to come to you. He is a guest in the home of Simon, a leatherworker, by the sea.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. All of us are here now in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has ordered you to say.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>Then Peter opened his mouth and said, “Now I understand that God shows no partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>Indeed, the person who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him in any nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>He has sent his word to the descendants of Israel and brought them the good news of peace through Jesus Christ. This man is the Lord of everyone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>You know what happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and he went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>We are witnesses of everything he did both in the land of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They hung him on a tree and killed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to us who were chosen by God to be witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>He also ordered us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this is the one ordained by God to be the judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To him all the prophets testify that everyone who believes in him receives the forgiveness of sins through his name.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter was still speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all the people who were listening to his message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>Then the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles, too.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God.Then Peter said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>“No one can stop us from using water to baptize these people who have received the Holy Spirit in the same way that we did, can he?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>So he ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to stay for several days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles had also accepted the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who emphasized circumcision disagreed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>They said, “You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>Then Peter began to explain to them point by point what had happened. He said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>“I was in the town of Joppa praying when in a trance I saw a vision: Something like a large linen sheet was coming down from heaven, being lowered by its four corners, and it came right down to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>When I examined it closely, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the air.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>I also heard a voice telling me,‘Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat it.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I replied, ‘Absolutely not, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>Then the voice from heaven answered a second time,‘You must stop calling common what God has made clean!’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>This happened three times. Then everything was pulled up to heaven again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>“At that very moment three men arrived at the house where we were staying. They had been sent to me from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>The Spirit told me to go with them and not to treat them differently. These six brothers went with me, too, and we went into the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>Then he told us how he had seen the angel standing in his home and saying, ‘Send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>He will speak words to you by which you and your entire home will be saved.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>“When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he had on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>Then I remembered the word of the Lord—how he had said,‘John baptized withwater, but you will be baptized withthe Holy Spirit.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>Now if God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to try to stop God?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>When they heard this, they quieted down, and praised God, saying, “So God has given even the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Now the people who were scattered by the persecution that started because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene who came to Antioch and began talking to the Hellenistic Jews too, proclaiming the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number of people believed and turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>News of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and so they sent Barnabas all the way to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>When he arrived, he rejoiced to see what the grace of God had done, and with a hearty determination he continuously encouraged them all to remain faithful to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith. And so a large crowd was brought to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>Then Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>When he found him, he brought him to Antioch, and for a whole year they were guests of the church and taught a large crowd. It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>At that time some prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>One of them named Agabus got up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine all over the world. This happened during the reign of Claudius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>So every one of the disciples decided, as he was able, to send a contribution to the brothers living in Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>They did this by sending Barnabas and Saul to the elders.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>About that time, Herod arrested some people who belonged to the church and mistreated them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>He even had James the brother of John killed with a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>When he saw how this was agreeable to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter, too. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>When he arrested him, he put him in prison and turned him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, planning to bring him out to the people after the Passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>So Peter was being kept in prison, but earnest prayer to God for him was being offered by the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>That very night, before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, and guards in front of the door were watching the prisoners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on his side, woke him up, and said, “Get up quickly!” His chains fell from his wrists.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>Then the angel said to him, “Tuck in your shirt and put on your sandals!” He did this. Then the angel told him, “Put on your coat and follow me!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>So he went out and began to follow him, not realizing that what was being done by the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron gate that led into the city. It opened by itself for them, and they went outside and proceeded one block when the angel suddenly left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>Then Peter came to himself and said, “Now I'm sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hands of Herod and from everything the Jewish people were expecting!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>When he realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where a large number of people had gathered and were praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>When he knocked at the outer gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>On recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she didn't open the gate but ran in and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>They said to her, “You're out of your mind!” But she kept insisting that it was so. Then they said, “It's his angel.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>Meanwhile, Peter kept on knocking and knocking. When they opened the gate, they saw him and were amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet, and then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He added, “Tell this to James and the brothers.” Then he left and went somewhere else.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>When morning came, there was no little commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>Herod searched for him but didn't find him, so he questioned the guards and ordered them to be executed. Then he left Judea, went down to Caesarea, and stayed there for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now Herod had a violent quarrel with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him as a group. After they had won over Blastus, who took care of the king's bedroom, they asked for peace because their country depended on the king's country for food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>Therefore, on a day that was set, Herod put on his royal robes, sat down on the royal seat, and made a speech to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>The people kept shouting, “This is the voice of a god, not of a man!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>Immediately the angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But the word of God continued to grow and spread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>When Barnabas and Saul had fulfilled their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, bringing with them John who was also called Mark.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen who had been brought up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul were prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, “Set Barnabas and Saul apart for me to do the work for which I called them.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>Then they fasted and prayed, laid their hands on them, and let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>Being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia and from there sailed to Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>Arriving in Salamis, they began to preach God's word in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John to help them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>They went through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish occult practitioner and false prophet named Bar-Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>He was associated with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. He sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the occult practitioner (that is the meaning of his name) continued to oppose them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked him straight in the eye</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>and said, “You are full of every form of deception and trickery, you son of the devil, you enemy of all that is right! You will never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord, will you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>The hand of the Lord is against you now, and you will be blind and not see the sun for a while!” At that moment a dark mist came over him, and he went around looking for someone to lead him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the Lord's teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Then Paul and his men set sail from Paphos and arrived in Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and went back to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>They left Perga and arrived in Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders asked them, “Brothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people, you may speak.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>Then Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said: “Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made them a great people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with an uplifted arm he led them out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>After he had put up with them for forty years in the wilderness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>he destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan. Then he gave them their land as an inheritance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>for about 450 years. After that he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>“Then they demanded a king, and for forty years God gave them Saul, the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>But he removed Saul and made David their king, about whom he testified, ‘I have found that David, the son of Jesse, is a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my wishes.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>It was from this man's descendants that God, as he promised, brought to Israel a Savior, who is Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>Before his coming, John had already preached a baptism of repentance to all the people in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>When John was finishing his work, he said, ‘Who do you think I am? I am not the one. No, but he is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>“My brothers, descendants of Abraham's family, and those among you who fear God, it is to us that the message of this salvation has been sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>For the people who live in Jerusalem and their leaders, not knowing who he was, condemned him and fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>Although they found no reason to sentence him to death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>When they had finished doing everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>But God raised him from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>and for many days he appeared to those who had come with him to Jerusalem from Galilee. These are now his witnesses to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>We are telling you the good news: What God promised our ancestors</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>he has fulfilled for us, their descendants, by raising Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm, ‘You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>He raised him from the dead, never to experience decay. As he said, ‘I will give you the holy promises made to David.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>In another Psalm he says, ‘You will not let your Holy One experience decay.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>For David, after he had served God's purpose in his own generation, died and was laid to rest with his ancestors, and so he experienced decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>However, the man whom God raised did not experience decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>“Therefore, brothers, you must understand that through him the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>and that everyone who believes in him is justified and freed from everything that kept you from being justified by the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>So be careful that what the prophets said does not happen to you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>‘Look, you mockers!Be amazed and die!	For I am doing a work in your days, a work that you would not believeeven if someone told you!’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>As Paul and Barnabas were leaving, the people kept urging them to tell them the same things the next Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who kept talking to them and urging them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>The next Sabbath almost the whole town gathered to hear the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to object to the statements made by Paul and even to abuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>Then Paul and Barnabas boldly declared, “We had to speak God's word to you first, but since you reject it and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we are now going to turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For that is what the Lord ordered us to do: ‘I have made you a light to the Gentiles to be the means of salvation to the very ends of the earth.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>When the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord. Meanwhile, all who had been destined to eternal life believed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>and the word of the Lord began to spread throughout the whole region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews stirred up devout women of high social standing and the officials in the city, started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>So they shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>Meanwhile, the disciples continued to be full of joy and of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>In Iconium they went into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>They stayed there a considerable time and continued to speak boldly for the Lord, who kept affirming his word of grace and granting signs and wonders to be done by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>But the people of the city were divided. Some were with the Jews, while others were with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>Now when an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, along with their authorities, to mistreat and stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>they found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding territory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>There they kept telling the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>Now in Lystra there was a man sitting down who couldn't use his feet. He had been crippled from birth and had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>He was listening to Paul as he spoke. Paul watched him closely, and when he saw that he had faith to be healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>he said in a loud voice, “Stand up straight on your feet!” Then the man jumped up and began to walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, “The gods have become like men and have come down to us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>They began to call Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, because he was the main speaker.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>The priest of the temple of Zeus, which was just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates. He and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>“Men, why are you doing this? We are merely human beings with natures like your own. We are telling you the good news to turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>yet he has not left himself without a witness by doing good, by giving you rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, and by filling you with food and joyful hearts.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>Even by saying this it was all they could do to keep the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>But some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowds by persuasion. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, thinking he was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But the disciples formed a circle around him, and he got up and went back to town. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>As they were proclaiming the good news in that city, they discipled a large number of people. Then they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>strengthening the souls of the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith, saying, “We must endure many hardships to get into the kingdom of God.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>They appointed elders for them in each church, and with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>They spoke the word in Perga and went down to Attalia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work they had completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>When they arrived, they called the church together and told them everything that God had done with them and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.28'>Then they spent a long time with the disciples.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>Then some men came down from Judea and started to teach the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the law of Moses, you can't be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Paul and Barnabas had quite a dispute and argument with them. So Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to confer with the apostles and elders about this question.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>They were sent on their way by the church, and as they were going through Phoenecia and Samaria they told of the conversion of the Gentiles and brought great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported everything that God had done through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, “They must be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of Moses.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>So the apostles and the elders met to consider this statement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>After a lengthy debate, Peter stood up and said to them, “Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose me to be the one among you through whom the Gentiles would hear the message of the gospel and believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>God, who knows everyone's heart, showed them he approved by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>He made no distinction between them and us, because he cleansed their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>So why do you test God by putting on the disciples’ neck a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we could carry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>We certainly believe that it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ that we are saved, just as they are.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>The whole crowd was silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul tell about all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>After they had finished speaking, James responded by saying, “Brothers, listen to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon has explained how God first showed his concern for the Gentiles by taking from among them a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>‘After this, I will come backand set up David's fallen tent again.	I will restore its ruined places and set it up again</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>so that the rest of the people may search for the Lord,			including all the Gentiles who are called by my name,	declares the Lord.	He is the one who has been doing these things</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>that have always been known.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>Therefore, I have decided that we should not trouble these Gentiles who are turning to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>Instead, we should write to them to keep away from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from anything strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>After all, Moses has had people to proclaim him in every city for generations, and on every Sabbath he is read aloud in the synagogues.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then the apostles, the elders, and the whole church decided to choose some of their men to send with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch. These were Judas, who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, who were leaders among the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>They wrote this letter for them to deliver:“From the apostles and the elders, your brothers, to their Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>We have heard that some men, coming from us without instructions from us, have said things to trouble you and have unsettled your minds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.25'>So we have unanimously decided to choose men and send them to you with our dear Barnabas and Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same things by word of mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place on you any burden but these essential requirements:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>to keep away from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from anything strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you avoid these things, you will prosper. Goodbye.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>So the men were sent on their way and arrived in Antioch. They gathered the congregation together and delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>When the people read it, they were pleased with the encouragement it brought them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>Then Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, said much to encourage and strengthen the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>After staying there for some time, they were sent back with a greeting from the brothers to those who had sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>Both Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch and taught and proclaimed the word of the Lord, as did many others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>Some days after this, Paul said to Barnabas, “Let's go back and visit the brothers in every town where we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they're doing.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>Barnabas persisted in wanting to take along John, who was called Mark,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>but Paul did not think it was right to be taking along the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them into the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>The disagreement was so sharp that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>while Paul chose Silas and left after the brothers had commended him to the grace of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>He went through Syria and Cilicia and strengthened the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>He also went to Derbe and Lystra. Here there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, although his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>He was highly regarded by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted this man to go with him, so he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who lived in those places, for everyone knew that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>As they went from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for them to obey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>So the churches continued to be strengthened in the faith and to increase in numbers every day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>Then they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia because they had been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>They went as far as Mysia and tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not let them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>So they passed by Mysia and went down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>During the night Paul had a vision. A man from Macedonia was standing there and pleading with him, “Come over to Macedonia and help us!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.10'>As soon as he had seen the vision, we immediately looked for a way to go to Macedonia, for we were convinced that God had called us to tell them the good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Sailing from Troas, we went straight to Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and from there to Philippi, a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We were in this city for several days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>On the Sabbath day we went out of the gate and along the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer. We sat down and began talking to the women who had gathered there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>A woman named Lydia, a dealer in purple goods from the city of Thyatira, was listening to us. She was a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to listen carefully to what was being said by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>When she and her family were baptized, she urged us, “If you are convinced that I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my home.” And she continued to insist that we do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>Once, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of fortune-telling and who had brought her owners a great deal of money by predicting the future.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>She would follow Paul and us and shout, “These men are servants of the Most High God and are proclaiming to you a way of salvation!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>She kept doing this for many days until Paul became annoyed, turned to the spirit, and said, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out that very moment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the public square.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>They brought them before the magistrates and said, “These men are stirring up a lot of trouble in our city. They are Jews</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and are advocating customs that we are not allowed to accept or practice as Romans.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>The crowd joined in the attack against them. Then the magistrates had them stripped of their clothes and ordered them beaten with sticks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>After giving them a severe beating, they threw them in jail and ordered the jailer to keep them under tight security.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>Having received these orders, he put them into the inner cell and fastened their feet in leg irons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>Around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>Suddenly, there was an earthquake so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken. All the doors immediately flew open, and everyone's chains were unfastened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, for he thought the prisoners had escaped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.28'>But Paul shouted in a loud voice, “Don't hurt yourself, for we are all here!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>The jailer asked for torches and rushed inside. He was trembling as he knelt in front of Paul and Silas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>Then he took them outside and asked, “Sirs, what must I do to be saved?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>They answered, “Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and everyone in his home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>At that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds. Then he and his entire family were baptized immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>He brought them upstairs into his house and set food before them, and he and everyone in his house were thrilled to be believers in God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>When day came, the magistrates sent guards and said, “Release those men.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>The jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, “The magistrates have sent word to release you. So come out now and go in peace.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul told them, “They have had us beaten publicly without a trial and have thrown us into jail, even though we are Roman citizens. Now are they going to throw us out secretly? Certainly not! Have them come and escort us out.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>The guards reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>So they came, apologized to them, and escorted them out. Then they asked them to leave the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>Leaving the jail, they went to Lydia's house. They saw the brothers, encouraged them, and then left.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.17'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>They traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>As usual, Paul went in and on three Sabbaths discussed the Scriptures with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>He explained and showed them that the Christ had to suffer and rise from the dead. He said, “This very Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Christ.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>Some of them were persuaded to join Paul and Silas, especially a large crowd of devout Greeks and the wives of many prominent men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the Jews became jealous, and they took some contemptible characters who used to hang out in the public square, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason's home and searched it for Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials and shouted, “These fellows who have turned the world upside down have come here, too,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>and Jason has welcomed them as his guests. All of them oppose the emperor's decrees by saying that there is another king—Jesus!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>The crowd and the city officials were upset when they heard this,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>but after they had gotten a bond from Jason and the others they let them go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>That night the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>These people were more receptive than those in Thessalonica. They were very willing to receive the message, and every day they carefully examined the Scriptures to see if those things were so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Many of them believed, including a large number of prominent Greek women and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews in Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul also in Berea, they went there to upset and incite the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>The men who escorted Paul took him all the way to Athens and, after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was stirred to its depths to see the city full of idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>So he began holding discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and other worshipers, as well as every day in the public square with anyone who happened to be there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some asked, “What is this blabbermouth trying to say?” while others said, “He seems to be preaching about foreign gods.” This was because he was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>Then they took him, brought him before the Areopagus, and asked, “May we know what this new teaching of yours is?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>It sounds rather strange to our ears, and we would like to know what it means.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there used to spend their time in nothing else than repeating or listening to the latest ideas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>So Paul stood up in front of the Areopagus and said, “Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For as I was walking around and looking closely at the objects you worship, I even found an altar with this written on it: ‘To an unknown god.’ So I am telling you about the unknown object you worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn't live in shrines made by human hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>and he isn't served by hands as if he needed anything. He himself gives everyone life, breath, and everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>From one man he made every nation of humanity to live all over the earth, fixing the seasons of the year and the boundaries they live in,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>so that they might look for God, somehow reach for him, and find him. Of course, he is never far from any one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For we live, move, and exist because of him, as some of your own poets have said: ‘For we are his children, too.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>So if we are God's children, we shouldn't think that the divine being is like gold, silver, or stone, or is an image carved by human imagination and skill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>Though God has overlooked those times of ignorance, he now commands everyone everywhere to repent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>for he has set a day when he is going to judge the world with justice through a man he has appointed, and he has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>When they heard about a resurrection of the dead, some began joking about it, while others said, “We will hear you again about this.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>And so Paul left the meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>Some men joined him and became believers. With them were Dionysius, who was a member of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and some others along with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>and because they had the same trade he stayed with them. They worked together because they were tentmakers by trade.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>Every Sabbath he would argue in the synagogue and try to persuade both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>But when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to the word as he solemnly assured the Jews that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But when they began to oppose him and insult him, he shook out his clothes in protest and told them, “Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>Then he left that place and went to the home of a man named Titius Justus, who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>Now Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, along with his whole family. Many Corinthians who heard Paul also believed and were baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision,“Stop being afraid to speak out! Do not be silent!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you or harm you, because I have many people in this city.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>So he lived there for a year and a half and continued to teach the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews united in an attack on Paul and brought him before the judge's seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>They said, “This man is persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to the law.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>Paul was about to open his mouth when Gallio said to the Jews, “If there were some misdemeanor or crime involved, it would be reasonable to put up with you Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But since it is a question about words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of that yourselves. I refuse to be a judge in these matters.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>So he drove them away from the judge's seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>Then all of them took Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and began beating him in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>After staying there for quite a while longer, Paul said goodbye to the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchraea he had his hair cut, since he was under a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>When they arrived in Ephesus, he left them there. Then he went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>They asked him to stay longer, but he refused.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>As he told them goodbye, he said, “I will come back to you again if it is God's will.” Then he set sail from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>When he arrived in Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, greeted the church, and then returned to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria and an eloquent man, one powerful in the Scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>He had been instructed in the Lord's way, and with spiritual fervor he kept speaking and teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew only about John's baptism.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained God's way to him more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>When he wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers wrote and urged the disciples to welcome him. On his arrival he greatly helped those who through grace had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>He successfully refuted the Jews in public and proved by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>It was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul passed through the inland districts and came to Ephesus. He found a few disciples there</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>and asked them, “Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?”They answered him, “No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>He then asked, “Then into what were you baptized?”They answered, “Into John's baptism.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>Then Paul said, “John baptized with a baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>There were about twelve men in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>He went into the synagogue and spoke there boldly for three months, holding discussions and persuading them about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some people became stubborn, refused to believe, and slandered the Way before the people, he left them, took his disciples away from them, and had daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the word of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>God continued to do extraordinary miracles by Paul's hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>When the handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his skin were taken to the sick, their diseases left them, and the evil spirits went out of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>Then some Jews who went around trying to drive out demons attempted to use the name of the Lord Jesus on those who had evil spirits, saying, “I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>But the evil spirit said to them, “I know Jesus, and I am acquainted with Paul, but who are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them, got the better of them, and so violently overpowered all of them that they fled out of the house naked and bruised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>When this became known to everyone living in Ephesus, Jews and Greeks alike, fear came on all of them, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in high honor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>Many who became believers kept coming and confessing and telling about their practices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>Moreover, many people who had practiced occult arts gathered their books and burned them in front of everybody. They estimated the price of them and found they were worth 50,000 silver coins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>In that way the word of the Lord kept spreading and triumphing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>After these things had happened, Paul resolved in the Spirit to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to go on to Jerusalem, saying, “After I have gone there, I must also see Rome.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>So he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia a while longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>Now just about that time a great commotion broke out concerning the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>A silversmith named Demetrius provided a large income for the skilled workers by making silver shrines of Artemis.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>He called a meeting of these men and others who were engaged in similar trades and said, “Men, you well know that we get a good income from this business.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>You also see and hear that, not only in Ephesus, but almost all over Asia, this man Paul has won over and taken away a large crowd by telling them that gods made by human hands are not gods at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>There is a danger not only that our business will lose its reputation but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be brought into contempt and that she will be robbed of her majesty that brought all Asia and the world to worship her.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>When they heard this, they became furious and began to shout, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed into the theater together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's fellow travelers from Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>Paul wanted to go into the crowd, but the disciples wouldn't let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>Even some officials of the province of Asia who were his friends sent him a message urging him not to risk his life in the theater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing, some another. For the assembly was confused, and most of them didn't know why they were meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>Some of the crowd concluded it was because of Alexander, since the Jews had pushed him to the front. So Alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But when they found out that he was a Jew, they all started to shout in unison for about two hours, “Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>When the city recorder had quieted the crowd, he said, “Men of Ephesus, who in the world doesn't know that this city of Ephesus is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of the statue that fell down from heaven?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Since these things cannot be denied, you must be quiet and not do anything reckless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For you have brought these men here, although they neither rob temples nor blaspheme our goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>So if Demetrius and his workers have a charge against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They should accuse one another there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>But if you want anything else, it must be settled in the regular assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, and there is no good reason we can give to justify this commotion.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>When the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples and encouraged them. Then he said goodbye to them and left to go to Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>He went through those regions and encouraged the people with many words. Then he went to Greece</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>and stayed there for three months. When he was about to sail for Syria, a plot was made against him by the Jews, so he decided to go back through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>He was accompanied by Sopater (the son of Pyrrhus) from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These men went on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>After the days of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi, and days later we joined them in Troas and stayed there for seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread, Paul began to address the people. Since he intended to leave the next day, he went on speaking until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in a window, began to sink off into a deep sleep as Paul kept speaking longer and longer. Overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>But Paul went down, bent over him, took him into his arms, and said, “Stop being alarmed, for his life is in him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>Then he went back upstairs, broke the bread, and ate. He talked with them for a long time, until dawn, and then left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>Then they took the boy away alive and were greatly relieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>We went ahead to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we were intending to pick up Paul. He had arranged it this way, since he had planned to travel there on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>When he met us in Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>We sailed from there and on the following day arrived off Chios. The next day we crossed over to Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The day after that we came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia, as he was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if that was possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>From Miletus he sent messengers to Ephesus to ask the elders of the church to meet with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>When they came to him, he said to them, “You know how I lived among you the entire time from the first day I set foot in Asia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>I served the Lord with all humility, with tears, and with trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>I never shrank from telling you anything that would help you nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance toward God and faith toward our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>“And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>except that in town after town the Holy Spirit assures me that imprisonment and suffering are waiting for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I don't place any value on my life, if only I can finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>“Now I know that none of you among whom I traveled preaching the kingdom will ever see my face again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>I therefore declare to you today that I am not responsible for the blood of any of you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>for I never shrank from telling you the whole plan of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Pay attention to yourselves and to the entire flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to be shepherds of God's church, which he acquired with his own blood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>Indeed, some of your own men will come forward and distort the truth in order to lure the disciples into following them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>So be alert! Remember that for three years, night and day, I never stopped warning each of you with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>“I am now entrusting you to God and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and give you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>I never desired anyone's silver, gold, or clothes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to support myself and those who were with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>In every way I showed you that by working hard like this we should help the weak and remember the words that the Lord Jesus himself said,‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>When he had said this, he knelt down and prayed with all of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>All of them cried and cried as they put their arms around Paul and kissed him with affection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>They were especially sorrowful because of what he had said—that they would never see his face again. Then they took him to the ship.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>When we had torn ourselves away from them, we sailed straight to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>There we found a ship going across to Phoenecia, so we went aboard and sailed away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>We came in sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on our left we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre because the ship was to unload its cargo there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>So we looked up the disciples and stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they kept telling Paul not to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>but when our days there were ended we left and proceeded on our journey. All of them with their wives and children accompanied us out of the city. We knelt on the beach, prayed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>and said goodbye to each other. Then we went aboard the ship, and they went back home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>On finishing the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, greeted the brothers, and stayed with them for one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>The next day we left and came to Caesarea. We went to the home of Philip the evangelist, one of the seven, and stayed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>He had four unmarried daughters who could prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>After we had been there for a number of days, a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>He came to us, took Paul's belt, and tied his own feet and hands with it. Then he said, “The Holy Spirit says, ‘This is how the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt. Then they will hand him over to the Gentiles.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>When we heard this, we and the people who lived there begged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>Then Paul replied, “What do you mean by crying and breaking my heart? I'm ready not only to be tied up in Jerusalem but even to die for the name of the Lord Jesus!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>When he could not be persuaded, we remained silent except to say, “May the Lord's will be done.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>After those days, we got ready to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us. They took us to the home of Mnason to be his guests. He was from Cyprus and had been an early disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us warmly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>The next day Paul went with us to visit James, and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>After greeting them, Paul related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>When they heard about it, they praised God and told him, “You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and all of them are zealous for the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>But they have been told about you—that you teach all the Jews living among the Gentiles to forsake the Law of Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>So do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Take these men, go through the purification ceremony with them, and pay the expenses to shave their heads. Then everyone will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself constantly observe and guard the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>As for the Gentiles who have become believers, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should keep away from food that has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul took the men and the next day purified himself with them. Then he went into the temple to announce the time when the days of purification would be over and when the sacrifice would be offered for each of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, seeing Paul in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd. They grabbed him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>yelling, “Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere to turn against our people, the law, and this place. More than that, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and desecrated this holy place.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they had earlier seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him and had supposed that Paul had taken him into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>The whole city was in chaos, and the people rushed together. They grabbed Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>They were trying to kill him when a report reached the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>Immediately he took some soldiers and officers and ran down to them. When they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>Then the tribune came up, grabbed Paul, and ordered him to be tied up with two chains. He then asked who Paul was and what he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>Some of the crowd shouted this and some that. Since he couldn't learn the facts because of the confusion, he ordered him to be taken into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>When Paul got to the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the mob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>The crowd of people kept following him and shouting, “Kill him!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he said to the tribune, “May I say something to you?”He asked, “Do you know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>You're not the Egyptian who started a revolt some time ago and led 4,000 assassins into the desert, are you?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>Paul replied, “I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. I beg you to let me speak to the people.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>He gave him permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand for the people to be silent. When everyone had quieted down, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>“Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense that I am now making before you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>When they heard him speaking to them in Hebrew, they became even more quiet, and he continued,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>“I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia but raised in this city and educated at the feet of Gamaliel in the strict ways of our ancestral law. I am as zealous for God as all of you are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>I persecuted this Way even to the death and kept tying up both men and women and putting them in prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>as the high priest and the whole Council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was going there to tie up those who were there and bring them back to Jerusalem to be punished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>“But while I was on my way and approaching Damascus about noon, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me,‘Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>I answered, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ He said to me,‘I am Jesus from Nazareth,whom you are persecuting.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>The men who were with me saw the light but didn't understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>“Then I asked, ‘What am I to do, Lord?’ The Lord told me,‘Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told everything you are destined to do.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>Since I could not see because of the brightness of the light, the men who were with me took me by the hand and led me into Damascus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>“A certain Ananias, who was a devout man in accordance with the law and who was highly regarded by all the Jews living there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>came to me. He stood beside me and said, ‘Brother Saul, receive your sight!’ At that moment I could see him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>Then he said, ‘The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear his own voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>because you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>What are you waiting for now? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away as you call on his name.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>“Then I returned to Jerusalem. While I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>and saw the Lord saying to me,‘Hurry up and get out of Jerusalem at once, because the peoplewon't accept your testimony about me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>I said, ‘Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I kept imprisoning and beating those who believe in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>Even when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I was standing there approving it and guarding the coats of those who were killing him.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>Then he said to me,‘Go, because I will send you far away to the Gentiles.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>Up to this point they listened to him, but then they began to shout, “Away with such a fellow from the earth! He's not fit to go on living!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>While they were yelling, tossing their coats around, and throwing dirt into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the tribune ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks and told the soldiers to question him with a beating in order to find out why they were yelling at him like this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>But when they had tied him up with the straps, Paul asked the centurion who was standing there, “Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't been condemned?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, “What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>So the tribune went and asked Paul, “Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?”“Yes,” he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>Then the tribune replied, “I paid a lot of money for this citizenship of mine.”Paul said, “But I was born a citizen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Immediately those who were about to examine him stepped back, and the tribune was afraid when he found out that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had tied him up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>The next day, since the Tribune wanted to find out exactly what Paul was being accused of by the Jews, he released him and ordered the high priests and the entire Council to meet. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>Paul looked straight at the Council and said, “Brothers, with a clear conscience I have done my duty before God up to this very day.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>Then the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near him to strike him on the mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>At this Paul said to him, “God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! How can you sit there and judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law order me to be struck?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>The men standing near him asked, “Do you mean to insult God's high priest?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>Paul answered, “I didn't realize, brothers, that he is the high priest. After all, it is written, ‘You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>When Paul saw that some of them were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he shouted in the Council, “Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a descendant of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope of the resurrection of the dead.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>After he said that, an angry quarrel broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection and that there is no such thing as an angel or spirit, but the Pharisees believe in all those things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>There was a great deal of shouting until some of the scribes who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and argued forcefully, “We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>The quarrel was becoming violent, and the tribune was afraid that they would tear Paul to pieces. So he ordered the soldiers to go down, take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>That night the Lord stood near him and said,“Have courage! For just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, you must testify in Rome, too.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>In the morning, the Jews formed a conspiracy and took an oath not to eat or drink anything before they had killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>More than forty men formed this conspiracy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>They went to the high priests and elders and said, “We have taken a solemn oath not to taste any food before we have killed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now then, you and the Council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to look into his case more carefully, but before he arrives we'll be ready to kill him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But the son of Paul's sister heard about the ambush, so he came and got into the barracks and told Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the tribune, because he has something to tell him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>So he took him, brought him to the tribune, and said, “The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>The tribune took him by the hand, stepped aside to be alone with him, and asked, “What have you got to tell me?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>He answered, “The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Council tomorrow as though they were going to examine his case more carefully.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>Don't believe them, because more than forty of them are planning to ambush him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink before they have killed him. They are ready now, just waiting for your consent.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>The tribune dismissed the young man and ordered him not to tell anyone that he had notified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>Then he summoned two of the centurions and said, “Get 200 soldiers ready to leave for Caesarea at nine o'clock tonight, along with seventy mounted soldiers and 200 soldiers with spears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>Provide an animal for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Governor Felix.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>He wrote a letter with this message:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>“From Claudius Lysias to Your Excellency, Governor Felix. Greetings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man had been seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I went with the guard and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>I wanted to know the exact charge they were making against him, so I had him brought before their Council.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>I found that, although he was charged with questions about their law, there was no charge against him deserving death or imprisonment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>Since a plot against the man has been reported to me, I am at once sending him to you and have also ordered his accusers to present their charges against him before you.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>So the soldiers, in keeping with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>The next day they let the horsemen ride on with him while they returned to their barracks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>When these came to Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>After reading the letter, he asked which province he was from. On learning that he was from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said, “I will hear your case when your accusers arrive.” Then he ordered him to be kept in custody in Herod's palace.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>Five days later, the high priest Ananias arrived with some elders and Tertullius, an attorney, and they presented their case against Paul before the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>When Paul had been summoned, Tertullius opened the prosecution by saying:“Your Excellency Felix, since we are enjoying lasting peace through you, and since reforms for this nation are being brought about through your foresight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>we always and everywhere acknowledge it with profound gratitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But so as not to detain you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man a perfect pest and an agitator among all Jews throughout the world. He is a ringleader in the sect of the Nazarenes</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>and even tried to profane the temple, but we arrested him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>By examining him for yourself, you will be able to find out from him everything of which we accuse him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>The Jews supported his accusations by asserting that these things were true.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he replied: “Since I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I am pleased to present my defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>You can verify for yourself that I went up to worship in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>They never found me debating with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or throughout the city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>and they cannot prove to you the charges they are now bringing against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>However, I admit to you that in accordance with the Way, which they call a heresy, I worship the God of our ancestors and believe in everything written in the Law and the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish—that there is to be a resurrection of the righteous and the wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>Therefore, I always do my best to have a clear conscience in the sight of God and people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>After many years I have come back to my people to bring gifts for the poor and to offer sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>They found me in the temple doing these things just as I had completed the purification ceremony. No crowd or noisy mob was present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>But some Jews from Asia were there, and they should be here before you to accuse me if they have anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Otherwise, these men themselves should tell what wrong they found when I stood before the Council—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>unless it is for the one thing I shouted as I stood among them: ‘It is for the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.’”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>Felix was rather well informed about the Way, and so he adjourned the trial with the comment, “When Tribune Lysias arrives, I will decide your case.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>He ordered the centurion to guard Paul but to let him have some freedom and not to keep any of his friends from caring for his needs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>Some days later, Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him talk about faith in Christ Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and said, “For the present you may go. When I get a chance, I will send for you again.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>At the same time he was hoping to get money from Paul, and so he would send for him frequently to talk with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Since Felix wanted to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in prison.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>The high priests and Jewish leaders informed him of their charges against Paul, urging</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>and begging him as a favor to have Paul brought to Jerusalem. They were laying an ambush to kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Festus replied that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself would be going there soon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>“Therefore,” he said, “have your authorities come down with me and present their charges against him, if there is anything wrong with the man.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>Festus stayed with them no more than eight or ten days and then went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on the judge's seat and ordered Paul brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>When he arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him and began bringing a number of serious charges against him that they couldn't prove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>Paul said in his defense, “I have in no way sinned against the law of the Jews or the temple or the emperor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>Then Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, “Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried there before me on these charges?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul said, “I am standing before the emperor's judgment seat where I ought to be tried. I haven't done anything wrong to the Jews, as you know very well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>If I am guilty and have done something that deserves death, I don't refuse to die. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can hand me over to them as a favor. I appeal to the emperor!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Festus talked it over with the council and then answered, “To the emperor you have appealed; to the emperor you will go!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to welcome Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>Since they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king. He said, “There is a man here who was left in prison by Felix.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>When I went to Jerusalem, the high priests and the Jewish elders informed me about him and asked me to condemn him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>I answered them that it was not the Roman custom to hand over a man for punishment until the accused met his accusers face to face and had an opportunity to defend himself against the charge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>“So they came here with me, and the next day without any delay I sat down in the judge's seat and ordered the man to be brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>When his accusers stood up, they didn't accuse him of any of the crimes I was expecting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>Instead, they had several arguments with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who had died but whom Paul kept claiming was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>I was puzzled how I should investigate such matters and asked if he would like to go to Jerusalem and be tried there in regard to these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But Paul appealed his case and asked to be held in prison until the decision of his Majesty. So I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to the emperor.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>Agrippa told Festus, “I would like to hear the man.”“Tomorrow,” he said, “you will hear him.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>The next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived with much fanfare and went into the auditorium along with the tribunes and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>Then Festus said, “King Agrippa and all you men who are present with us! You see this man about whom the whole Jewish nation petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>I find that he has not done anything deserving of death. But since he has appealed to his Majesty, I have decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>I have nothing reliable to write our Sovereign about him, so I have brought him to all of you, and especially to you, King Agrippa, so that I will have something to write after he is cross-examined.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>Then Agrippa said to Paul, “You have permission to speak for yourself.” So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>“I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, that I can defend myself today against all the accusations of the Jews,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>since you are especially familiar with all the Jewish customs and controversies. I beg you, therefore, to listen patiently to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>All the Jews know how I lived from the earliest days of my youth with my own people and in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>They have known for a long time, if they would but testify to it, that I lived as a Pharisee by the standard of the strictest sect of our religion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>“And now it is for the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors that I stand here on trial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>Our twelve tribes, worshiping day and night with intense devotion, hope to attain it. It is for this hope, O King, that I am accused by the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it thought incredible by all of you that God should raise the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>Indeed, I myself thought it my duty to take extreme measures against the name of Jesus from Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>That is what I did in Jerusalem. I received authority from the high priests and locked many of the saints in prison. And when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>I would even punish them frequently in every synagogue and try to make them blaspheme. Raging furiously against them, I would hunt them down even to distant cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>“That is how I happened to be traveling to Damascus with authority based on a commission from the high priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>On the road at noon, O King, I saw from heaven a light that was brighter than the sun flash around me and those who were traveling with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>All of us fell to the ground, and I heard a voice asking me in the Hebrew language,‘Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me? It is hurting you to keep on kicking against the goads.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>I asked, ‘Who are you, Lord?’ The Lord answered,‘I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you to be a servant and witness of what you have seen and of what I will show you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>I will continue to rescue you from your people and from the Gentiles to whom I am sending you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>You will open their eyes and turn them from darkness to light and from Satan's control to God, so that they might receive the forgiveness of sins and a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>“And so, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>Instead, I first told the people in Damascus and Jerusalem, then the whole countryside of Judea, and then the Gentiles to repent, turn to God, and practice works that are consistent with such repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>For this reason the Jews grabbed me in the temple and kept trying to kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>I have had help from God to this day, and so I stand here to testify to high and low alike, stating only what the prophets and Moses said would happen—</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the Christ would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead and would announce light to our people and the Gentiles.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>As he continued to make his defense, Festus shouted, “You're out of your mind, Paul! Too much education is driving you crazy!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But Paul said, “I'm not out of my mind, Your Excellency Festus. I'm uttering words of sober truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>Indeed, the king knows about these things, and I can speak to him freely. For I am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice, since this wasn't done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>Agrippa said to Paul, “Can you so quickly persuade me to become a Christian?”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>Paul replied, “Whether quickly or not, I wish to God that not only you but everyone listening to me today would become what I am—except for these chains!”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and those who were sitting with him got up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>As they were leaving, they began to say to each other, “This man isn't doing anything to deserve death or imprisonment.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>Agrippa told Festus, “This man could have been set free if he hadn't appealed to the emperor.”</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, they transferred Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the emperor's division.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>Boarding a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to the ports on the coast of Asia, we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>The next day we arrived at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends and receive any care he needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>After putting out from there, we sailed on the sheltered side of Cyprus because the winds were against us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>We sailed along the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia and reached Myra in Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>We sailed slowly for a number of days and with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then, because the wind was against us, we sailed on the sheltered side of Crete off Cape Salome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>Sailing past it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>Much time had been lost, and because navigation had become dangerous and the day of fasting had already past, Paul began to warn them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>by saying, “Men, I see that in this voyage there will be hardship and a heavy loss not only of the cargo and ship but also of our lives.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship and not by what Paul said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>Since the harbor was not a good place to spend the winter, most of the men favored putting out to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix and spend the winter there. It is a harbor of Crete facing southwest and northwest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>When a gentle breeze began to blow from the south, they thought they could achieve their purpose. So they raised the anchor and began to sail close to the shore of Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But it was not long before a violent wind (called a northeaster) swept down from the island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>The ship was caught so that it couldn't face the wind, and we gave up and were swept along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>As we drifted to the sheltered side of a small island called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the ship's lifeboat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>They pulled it up on deck and used ropes to brace the ship. Fearing that they would hit the large sandbank near Lybia, they lowered the sail and drifted along.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>The next day, because we were being tossed so violently by the storm, they began to throw the cargo overboard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>On the third day they threw the ship's equipment overboard with their own hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>For a number of days neither the sun nor the stars were to be seen, and the storm continued to rage until at last all hope of our being saved vanished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood among them and said, “Men, you should have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete. You would have avoided this hardship and damage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>But now I urge you to have courage because there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For just last night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve, stood by me</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>and said, ‘Stop being afraid, Paul! You must stand before the emperor. Indeed, God has given you all who are sailing with you.’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>So have courage, men, for I trust God that it will turn out just as he told me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>However, we will have to run aground on some island.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>It was the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Adriatic Sea when about midnight the sailors suspected that land was near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>On taking soundings, they found a depth of twenty fathoms. A little later they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>Fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and began praying for daylight to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>Now the sailors were trying to escape from the ship. They had lowered the lifeboat into the sea and pretended that they were going to lay out the anchors from the bow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul told the centurion and the soldiers, “Unless these men remain in the ship, you cannot be saved.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and set it adrift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>Right up to daybreak Paul kept urging all of them to eat something, saying, “Today is the fourteenth day that you have been waiting and going without food, having eaten nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>So I urge you to eat something, for it will help you survive, since none of you will lose a hair from his head.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>After he said this, he took some bread, thanked God in front of everyone, broke it, and began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>All of them were encouraged and had something to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>There were 276 of us on the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>After they had eaten all they wanted, they began to lighten the ship by dumping the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>When day came, they couldn't recognize the land, but they could see a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore if possible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>So they cut the anchors free and left them in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars, raised the foresail to the wind, and headed for the beach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground. The bow stuck and couldn't be moved, while the stern was broken to pieces by the force of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>The soldiers’ plan was to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming ashore and escaping,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>but the centurion wanted to save Paul and prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>The rest were to follow, some on planks and others on various pieces of the ship. In this way all of them got to shore safely.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>When we were safely on shore, we learned that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>The people who lived there were unusually kind to us. It had started to rain and was cold, and so they made a fire and welcomed all of us around it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and put it on the fire. A poisonous snake was forced out by the heat and attached itself to Paul's hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>When the people who lived there saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, “This man must be a murderer! He may have escaped from the sea, but Justice won't let him live.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>But he shook the snake into the fire and wasn't harmed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>The governor of the island, whose name was Publius, owned estates in that part of the island, and he welcomed us and entertained us with great hospitality for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>The father of Publius happened to be sick in bed with fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed, and healed him by placing his hands on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>After that had happened, the rest of the sick people on the island went to him and were healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>They honored us in many ways, and when we were going to sail, they supplied us with everything we needed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>Three months later, we sailed on an Alexandrian ship that had spent the winter at the island. It had the Twin Brothers as its figurehead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>We stopped at Syracuse and stayed there for three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>Then we weighed anchor and came to Rhegium. A day later a south wind began to blow, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>The brothers there heard about us and came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and felt encouraged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>When we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>Three days later, he called the leaders of the Jews together. When they assembled, he said to them, “Brothers, although I haven't done anything against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>They examined me and wanted to let me go because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But the Jews objected and forced me to appeal to the emperor, even though I have no countercharge to bring against my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>That's why I asked to see you and speak with you, since it is for the hope of Israel that I'm wearing this chain.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>They told him, “We haven't received any letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or mentioned anything bad about you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>However, we would like to hear from you what you think, because everywhere people are talking against this sect.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>So they set a day to meet with him and came in large numbers to see him where he was staying. From morning until evening he continued to explain the kingdom of God to them, trying to convince them about Jesus from the law of Moses and the Prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>Some of them were convinced by what he said, but others wouldn't believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>They disagreed with one another as they were leaving, and Paul added a statement: “How well did the Holy Spirit speak to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>He said,	‘Go to this people and say,“You will listen and listenbut never understand,and you will look and lookbut never see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For this people's heart has become dull,and their ears are hard of hearing,	and they have shut their eyesso that they may never see with their eyes,	and listen with their ears,and understand with their heart	and turn and let me heal them.”’</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>“You must understand that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles, and they will listen.”</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>For two whole years he lived in his own rented place and welcomed everyone who came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>He continued to preach the kingdom of God and to teach about the Lord Jesus Christ with perfect boldness and freedom.</verse>
