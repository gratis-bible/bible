In the begynnynge God created heaven and erth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>
The erth was voyde and emptie ad darcknesse was vpon the depe and the spirite of god moved vpon the water
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>
Than God sayd: let there be lyghte and there was lyghte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>
And God sawe the lyghte that it was good: and devyded the lyghte from the darcknesse
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>
and called the lyghte daye and the darcknesse nyghte: and so of the evenynge and mornynge was made the fyrst daye
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>
And God sayd: let there be a fyrmament betwene the waters ad let it devyde the waters a sonder.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>
Than God made the fyrmament and parted the waters which were vnder the fyrmament from the waters that were above the fyrmament: And it was so.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>
And God called the fyrmament heaven And so of the evenynge and morninge was made the seconde daye
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>
And God sayd let the waters that are vnder heaven gather them selves vnto one place that the drye londe may appere: And it came so to passe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>
And god called the drye lande the erth and the gatheringe togyther of waters called he the see. And God sawe that it was good
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>
And God sayd: let the erth bringe forth herbe and grasse that sowe seed and frutefull trees that bere frute every one in his kynde havynge their seed in them selves vpon the erth. And it came so to passe:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>
ad the erth brought forth herbe and grasse sowenge seed every one in his kynde and trees berynge frute and havynge their seed in the selves every one in his kynde. And God sawe that it was good:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>
and the of the evenynge and mornynge was made the thyrde daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>
Than sayd God: let there be lyghtes in ye firmament of heaven to devyde the daye fro the nyghte that they may be vnto sygnes seasons days and yeares.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>
And let them be lyghtes in the fyrmament of heave to shyne vpon the erth. and so it was.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>
And God made two great lyghtes A greater lyghte to rule the daye and a lesse lyghte to rule the nyghte and he made sterres also.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>
And God put them in the fyrmament of heaven to shyne vpon the erth
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>
and to rule the daye and the nyghte ad to devyde the lyghte from darcknesse. And god sawe yt it was good:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>
and so of the evenynge ad mornynge was made the fourth daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>
And God sayd let the water bryng forth creatures that move and have lyfe and foules for to flee over the erth vnder the fyrmament of heaven.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>
And God created greate whalles and all maner of creatures that lyve and moue which the waters brought forth in their kindes ad all maner of federed foules in their kyndes. And God sawe that it was good:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>
and God blessed them saynge. Growe and multiplye ad fyll the waters of the sees and let the foules multiplye vpo the erth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>
And so of the evenynge and morninge was made the fyfth daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>
And God sayd: leth the erth bring forth lyvynge creatures in thir kyndes: catell and wormes and beastes of the erth in their kyndes and so it came to passe.
</verse>

And god made the beastes of the erth in their kyndes and catell in their kyndes ad all maner wormes of the erth in their kyndes: and God sawe that it was good.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>
And God sayd: let vs make man in oure symilitude ad after oure lycknesse: that he may have rule over the fysh of the see and over the foules of the ayre and over catell and over all the erth and over all wormes that crepe on the erth.

And God blessed them and God sayd vnto them. Growe and multiplye and fyll the erth and subdue it and have domynyon over the fysh of the see and over the foules of the ayre and over all the beastes that move on the erth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>
And God sayd: se I have geven yow all herbes that sowe seed which are on all the erth and all maner trees that haue frute in them and sowe seed: to be meate for yow
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>
and for all beastes of the erth and vnto all foules of the ayre and vnto all that crepeth on the erth where in is lyfe that they may haue all maner herbes and grasse for to eate and even so it was.
</verse>

ad i ye seueth daye god ended hys worke which he had made and rested in ye seventh daye fro all his workes which he had made.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>
And God blessed ye seventh daye and sanctyfyed it for in it he rested from all his workes which he had created and made.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>
These are the generations of heaven and erth when they were created in the tyme when the LORde God created heaven and erth
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>
and all the shrubbes of the felde be fore they were in the erthe. And all the herbes of the felde before they sprange: for the LORde God had yet sent no rayne vpon the erth nether was there yet any man to tylle the erth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>
But there arose a myste out of the ground and watered all the face of the erth:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>
Then the LORde God shope man even of the moulde of the erth and brethed into his face the breth of lyfe. So man was made a lyvynge soule.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>
The LORde God also planted a garden in Eden from the begynnynge and there he sette man whom he had formed.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>
And the LORde God made to sprynge out of the erth all maner trees bewtyfull to the syghte and pleasant to eate and the tree of lyfe in the middes of the garden: and also the tree of knowlege of good and euell.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>
And there spronge a rever out of Eden to water the garden and thence devided it selfe and grewe in to foure principall waters.
</verse>

The name of the one is Phison he it is that compasseth all the lande of heuila where gold groweth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>

And the name of the thyrde river is Hidekell which runneth on the easte syde of the assyryans And the fourth river is Euphrates.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>
And the LORde God toke Adam and put him in the garden of Eden to dresse it and to kepe it:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>
and the LORde God comaunded Ada saynge: of all the trees of the garde se thou eate.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>
But of the tre of knowlege of good and badd se that thou eate not: for even ye same daye thou eatest of it thou shalt surely dye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>
And the LORde God sayd: it is not good that man shulde be alone I will make hym an helper to beare him company:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>
And after yt the LORde God had make of the erth all maner beastes of the felde and all maner foules of the ayre he brought them vnto Adam to see what he wold call them. And as Ada called all maner livynge beastes: eve so are their names.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>
And Adam gave names vnto all maner catell and vnto the foules of the ayre and vnto all maner beastes of the felde. But there was no helpe founde vnto Adam to beare him companye
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>
Then the LORde God cast a slomber on Adam and he slepte. And then he toke out one of his rybbes and in stede ther of he fylled vp the place with flesh.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>
And the LORde God made of the rybbe which he toke out of Adam a woma and brought her vnto Adam.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>
Then sayd Ada this is once bone of my boones and flesh of my flesh. This shall be called woman: because she was take of the man.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>
For this cause shall a man leve father and mother and cleve vnto his wyfe and they shall be one flesh.

        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>
But the serpent was sotyller than all the beastes of the felde which ye LORde God had made and sayd vnto the woman. Ah syr that God hath sayd ye shall not eate of all maner trees in the garden.

And the woman sayd vnto the serpent of the frute of the trees in the garden we may eate

        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>
Then sayd the serpent vnto the woman: tush ye shall not dye:

        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>
But God doth knowe that whensoever ye shulde eate of it youre eyes shuld be opened and ye shulde be as God and knowe both good and evell.

</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>
And the eyes of both them were opened that they vnderstode how that they were naked. Than they sowed fygge leves togedder and made them apurns.

And they herd the voyce of the LORde God as he walked in the garde in the coole of the daye. And Adam hyd hymselfe and his wyfe also from the face of the LORde God amonge the trees of the garden.
</verse>

And Adam answered. The woman which thou gavest to bere me company she toke me of the tree ad I ate.
