These are the names of the children of Israel, which came to Egipte with Iacob euery man with his housholde:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>
Rube, Simeon, Leui, Iuda,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>
Isachar, Zabulon, Beniamin,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>
Dan, Neptali, Gad ad Aser.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>
All the soules that came out of the loynes of Iacob, were .lxx. and Ioseph was in Egipte all redie.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>
when Ioseph was dead and all his brethern and all that generation:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>
the children of Israel grewe, encreased, multiplied and waxed enceadinge myghtie: so that the londe was full of them. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>
Then there rose vp a new kynge in Egipte which knewe not Ioseph.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>
And he sayde vnto his folke: beholde the people of the childre of Israel are moo ad mightier than we.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>
Come on, let vs playe wisely with them: lest they multiplie, and then (yf there chaunce any warre) they ioyne them selues vnto oure enimies and fyghte ageynst vs, and so gete them out of the lande. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>
And he sette taskemasters ouer them, to kepe them vnder with burthens. And they byl vnto Pharao treasurecities: Phiton and Raamses.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>
But the more they vexed the, the moare they multiplied and grewe: so that they abhorred the childre of Israel.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>
And the Egiptias helde the childern of Israel in bondage without mercie,
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>
and made their lyues bitter vnto them with cruell laboure in claye and bricke, and all maner worke in the feldes, and in all maner of service, which they caused the to worke cruelly 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>
And the kynge of Egipte sayde vnto the mydwiues of the Ebrueswomen, of which the ones name was Ziphra ad the other Pua:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>
whe ye mydwiue the women of the Ebrues and se in the byrth tyme that it is a boye, kyll it. But yf it be a mayde, let it lyue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>
Notwithstonding the mydwiues feared God, and dyd not as the kinge of Egipte commauded them: but saued the menchildern. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>
The the kinge of Egipte called for the midwiues ad sayde vnto the: why haue ye delt on this maner and haue saued the menchildern?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>
And the mydwiues answered Pharao, that the Ebrues wemen were not as the wemen of Egipte: but were sturdie women, and were delyuered yer the midwyues came at them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>
And God therfore delt well with the midwyues. And the people multiplied and waxed very mightie.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>
And because the mydwiues feared God, he made them houses. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>
Than Pharao charged all his pepple sayng All the menchildern that are borne, cast in to the ryuer and save the maydchildern a lyue.

        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>
And whe she coude no longer hyde him, she toke a basket of bulrusshes ad dawbed it with slyme ad pytche, ad layde the childe therin, ad put it in the flagges by the riuers brynke.

And the doughter of Pharao came doune to the riuer to washe her selfe, and hir maydens walked a longe by the riuers syde. And when she sawe the basket amoge the flagges, she sent one of hir maydes and caused it to be fet.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>
And whe she had opened it she sawe the childe. and behold, the babe wepte. And she had copassio on it ad sayde: it is one of the Ebrues childern

        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>
Then sayde his sister vnto Pharaos doughter: shall I goo and call vnto the a nurse of the Ebrues wemen, to nurse the the childe?

And the mayde ranne and called the childes mother.

And it happened in these dayes when Moses was waxte great, that he went out vnto his brethern ad loked on their burthens, and spied an Egiptian smytynge one of his brethern an Ebrue.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>
And he loked round aboute: and when he sawe that there was no man by, he slewe the Egiptian and hyd hi in the sonde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>
And he went out a nother daye: and beholde, two Ebrues stroue to gether. And he sayde vnto him that dyd the wronge: wherfore smytest thou thine neyghboure?

        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>
And he answered: who hath made the a ruelar or a iudge ouer vs? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egiptian? Then Moses feared and sayde: of a suertie the thinge is knowne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>
And Pharao herde of it and went aboute to slee Moses: but he fled from Pharao ad dwelt in the lade of Madian, and he satt doune by a welles syde.

And the shepardes came and drove them awaye: But Moses stode vp and helped them and waterd their shepe.

        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>
And when they came to Raguel their father, he sayde: how happeneth it that ye are come so soone to daye?

And they answerede there was an Egiptia that delyuered vs fro the shepardes, and also drewe vs water and waterd the shepe.
