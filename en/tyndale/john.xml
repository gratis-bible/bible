      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>
In the beginnynge was the worde and the worde was with God: and the worde was God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>
The same was in the beginnynge with God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>
All thinges were made by it and with out it was made nothinge that was made.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>
In it was lyfe and the lyfe was ye lyght of men
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>
and the lyght shyneth in the darcknes but the darcknes comprehended it not.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>
There was a man sent from God whose name was Iohn.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>
The same cam as a witnes to beare witnes of the lyght that all men through him myght beleve.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>
He was not that lyght: but to beare witnes of the lyght.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>
That was a true lyght which lyghteth all men that come into the worlde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>
He was in ye worlde and the worlde was made by him: and yet the worlde knewe him not.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>
He cam amonge his (awne) and his awne receaved him not.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>
But as meny as receaved him to them he gave power to be the sonnes of God in yt they beleved on his name:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>
which were borne not of bloude nor of the will of the flesshe nor yet of the will of man: but of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>
And the worde was made flesshe and dwelt amonge vs and we sawe the glory of it as the glory of the only begotten sonne of ye father which worde was full of grace and verite.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>
Iohn bare witnes of him and cryed sayinge: This was he of whome I spake he that cometh after me was before me because he was yer then I.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>
And of his fulnes have all we receaved even (grace) for grace.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>
For the lawe was geven by Moses but grace and truthe came by Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>
No ma hath sene God at eny tyme. The only begotte sonne which is in ye bosome of ye father he hath declared him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>
And this is the recorde of Iohn: When the Iewes sent Prestes and Levites from Ierusalem to axe him what arte thou?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>
And he confessed and denyed not and sayde playnly: I am not Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>
And they axed him: what then? arte thou Helyas? And he sayde: I am not. Arte thou a Prophete? And he answered no.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>
Then sayd they vnto him: what arte thou that we maye geve an answer to them that sent vs: What sayest thou of thy selfe?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>
He sayde: I am the voyce of a cryar in the wyldernes make strayght the waye of the Lorde as sayde the Prophete Esaias.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>
And they which were sent were of the pharises.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>
And they axed him and sayde vnto him: why baptisest thou then yf thou be not Christ nor Helyas nether a Prophet?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>
Iohn answered them sayinge: I baptise with water: but one is come amonge you whom ye knowe not
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>
he it is that cometh after me whiche was before me whose sho latchet I am not worthy to vnlose.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>
These thinges were done in Bethabara beyonde Iordan where Iohn dyd baptyse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>
The nexte daye Iohn sawe Iesus commyge vnto him and sayde: beholde the lambe of God which taketh awaye the synne of the worlde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>
This is he of whom I sayde. After me cometh a man which was before me for he was yer then I
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>
and I knew him not: but that he shuld be declared to Israell therfore am I come baptisynge with water.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>
And Iohn bare recorde sayinge: I sawe the sprete descende from heven lyke vnto a dove and abyde apon him
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>
and I knewe him not. But he that sent me to baptise in water the same sayde vnto me: apon whom thou shalt se the sprete descende and tary styll on him the same is he which baptiseth with the holy goost.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>
And I sawe and bare recorde that this is the sonne of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>
The next daye after Iohn stode agayne and two of his disciples.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>
And he behelde Iesus as he walked by and sayde: beholde the lambe of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>
And the two disciples hearde him speake and folowed Iesus.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>
And Iesus turned about and sawe them folowe and sayde vnto them: what seke ye? They sayde vnto him: Rabbi (which is to saye by interpretacion Master) where dwellest thou?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>
He sayde vnto them: come and se. They came and sawe where he dwelt: and abode with him that daye. For it was about the tenthe houre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>
One of the two which hearde Iohn speake and folowed Iesus was Andrew Simon Peters brother.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>
The same founde his brother Simon fyrst and sayde vnto him: we have founde Messias which is by interpretacion annoynted:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>
and brought him to Iesus. And Iesus behelde him and sayde: thou arte Simon the sonne of Ionas thou shalt be called Cephas: which is by interpretacion a stone.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>
The daye folowynge Iesus wolde goo into Galile and founde Philip and sayde vnto him folowe me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>
Philip was of Bethsaida the cite of Andrew and Peter.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>
And Philip founde Nathanael and sayde vnto him. We have founde him of whom Moses in the lawe and the prophetes dyd wryte. Iesus the sonne of Ioseph of Nazareth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>
And Nathanael sayde vnto him: can ther eny good thinge come out of Nazareth? Philip sayde to him: come and se.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>
Iesus sawe Nathanael commynge to him and sayde of him. Beholde a ryght Israelite in who is no gyle.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>
Nathanael sayd vnto him: where knewest thou me? Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Before that Philip called the when thou wast vnder ye fygge tree I sawe the.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>
Nathanael answered and sayde vnto him: Rabbi thou arte the sonne of God thou arte the kynge of Israel.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>
Iesus answered and sayd vnto him: Because I sayde vnto the I sawe the vnder the fygge tree thou belevest. Thou shalt se greater thinges then these.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>
And he sayde vnto him: Verely verely I saye vnto you: herafter shall ye se heven open and the angels of God ascendynge and descendynge over the sonne of man.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>
And the thryde daye was ther a mariage in Cana a cite of Galile: and the mother of Iesus was there.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>
And Iesus was called also and his disciples vnto the mariage.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>
And when the wyne fayled the mother of Iesus sayde vnto him: they have no wyne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>
Iesus sayde vnto her: woman what have I to do with the? myne houre is not yet come.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>
His mother sayde vnto the ministres: whatsoever he sayeth vnto you do it.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>
And therwere stondynge theare sixe water pottes of stone after ye maner of the purifyinge of ye Iewes contaynynge two or thre fyrkins a pece.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>
And Iesus sayde vnto them: fyll the water pottes with water. And they fylled them vp to the brym.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>
And he sayde vnto them: drawe out now and beare vnto the governer of the feaste. And they bare it.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>
When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was turned vnto wyne and knewe not whence it was (but the ministres which drue the water knew). He called the brydegrome
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>
and sayde vnto him. All men at the beginnynge set forth good wyne and when men be dronke then that which is worsse. But thou hast kept backe the good wyne vntyll now.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>
This beginnynge of miracles dyd Iesus in Cana of Galile and shewed his glory and his disciples beleved on him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>
After that he descended in to Capernaum and his mother and his brethren and his disciples: but contynued not manye dayes there.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>
And the Iewes ester was even at honde and Iesus went vp to Ierusalem
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>
and founde syttynge in the temple those that solde oxen and shepe and doves and chaungers of money.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>
And he made a scourge of small cordes and drave them all out of the temple with the shepe and oxen and powred oute the changers money and overthrue the tables
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>
and sayde vnto them that solde doves: Have these thinges hence and make not my fathers housse an housse of marchaundyse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>
And his disciples remembred how yt it was wrytten: the zele of thyne housse hath even eaten me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>
Then answered the Iewes and sayde vnto him: what token shewest thou vnto vs seynge that thou dost these thinges?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>
Iesus answered and sayd vnto them: destroye this temple and in thre dayes I will reare it vp agayne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>
Then sayde the Iewes: xlvi. yeares was this temple abuyldinge: and wylt thou reare it vp in thre dayes?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>
But he spake of the temple of his body.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>
Assone therfore as he was rysen from deeth agayne his disciples remembred that he thus sayde. And they beleved the scripture and the wordes which Iesus had sayde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>
When he was at Ierusalem at ester in the feaste many beleved on his name when they sawe his miracles which he dyd.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>
But Iesus put not him selfe in their hondes because he knewe all men
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>
and neded not that eny man shuld testify of man. For he knewe what was in man.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>
Ther was a man of the pharises named Nicodemus a ruler amonge ye Iewes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>
The same cam to Iesus by nyght and sayde vnto him: Rabbi we knowe that thou arte a teacher whiche arte come from God. For no man coulde do suche miracles as thou doest except God were with him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>
Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: Verely verely I saye vnto the: except a man be boren a newe he cannot se the kyngdom of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>
Nicodemus sayde vnto him: how can a man be boren when he is olde? can he enter into his moders wombe and be boren agayne?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>
Iesus answered: verely verely I saye vnto the: except that a man be boren of water and of ye sprete he cannot enter into the kyngdome of god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>
That which is boren of the flesshe is flesshe: and that which is boren of the sprete is sprete.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>
Marvayle not that I sayd to the ye must be boren a newe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>
The wynde bloweth where he listeth and thou hearest his sounde: but canst not tell whence he cometh and whether he goeth. So is every man that is boren of the sprete.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>
And Nicodemus answered and sayde vnto him: how can these thinges be?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>
Iesus answered and sayde vnto him: arte thou a master in Israel and knowest not these thinges?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>
Verely verely I saye vnto the we speake that we knowe and testify that we have sene: and ye receave not oure witnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>
Yf when I tell you erthely thinges ye beleve not: how shuld ye beleve yf I shall tell you of hevenly thinges?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>
And no man ascendeth vp to heaven but he that came doune from heaven that is to saye the sonne of man which is in heaven.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>
And as Moses lifte vp the serpent in the wyldernes even so must the sonne of man be lifte vp
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>
that none that beleveth in him perisshe: but have eternall lyfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>
For God so loveth the worlde yt he hath geven his only sonne that none that beleve in him shuld perisshe: but shuld have everlastinge lyfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>
For God sent not his sonne into the worlde to condepne the worlde: but that the worlde through him might be saved.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>
He that beleveth on him shall not be condepned. But he that beleveth not is condempned all redy be cause he beleveth not in the name of the only sonne of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>
And this is the condempnacion: that light is come into the worlde and the me loved darcknes more then light because their dedes were evill.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>
For every man that evyll doeth hateth the light: nether commeth to light lest his dedes shuld be reproved.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>
But he that doth truth commeth to the light that his dedes might be knowen how that they are wrought in God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>
After these thinges cam Iesus and his disciples into the Iewes londe and ther he haunted with them and baptised.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>
And Iohn also baptised in Enon besydes Salim because ther was moche water there and they came and were baptised.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>
For Iohn was not yet cast into preson.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>
And ther arose a questio bitwene Iohns disciples and the Iewes about purifiynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>
And they came vnto Iohn and sayde vnto him: Rabbi he that was with the beyonde Iordan to whom thou barest witnes. Beholde the same baptyseth and all me come to him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>
Iohn answered and sayde: a man can receave no thinge at all except it be geve him fro heaven.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>
Ye youre selves are witnesses how that I sayde: I am not Christ but am sent before him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>
He that hath the bryde is the brydegrome. But the frende of the brydegrome which stondeth by and heareth him reioyseth greately of the brydgromes voyce. Tis my ioye is fulfilled.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>
He must increace: and I muste decreace.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>
He that commeth from an hye is above all: He that is of ye erth is of the erth and speaketh of the erth. He that cometh from heaven is above all
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>
and what he hath sene and hearde: that he testifieth: but no man receaveth his testimonye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>
How be it he that hath receaved hys testimonye hath set to his seale that God is true.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>
For he whom God hath sent speaketh the wordes of God. For God geveth not the sprete by measure.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>
The father loveth the sonne and hath geven all thinges into his honde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>
He that beleveth on the sonne hath everlastynge lyfe: and he that beleveth not the sonne shall not se lyfe but the wrathe of God abydeth on him.

Assone as the Lorde had knowledge how the Pharises had hearde that Iesus made and baptised moo disciples then Iohn

But whosoever shall drinke of ye water yt I shall geve him shall never be more a thyrst: but the water that I shall geve him shalbe in him a well of water springinge vp in to everlastinge lyfe.
