In the former treatise (Deare frende Theophilus) I have written of all that Iesus beganne to do and teache
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>
vntyll the daye in the which he was taken vp after that he thorowe the holy goost had geven commaundementes vnto the Apostles which he had chosen:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>
to whom also he shewed him selfe alyve after his passion by many tokens apperynge vnto them fourty dayes and speakynge of the kyngdome of god
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>
and gaddered them togeder and commaunded the that they shuld not departe from Ierusalem: but to wayte for ye promys of the father whereof ye have herde of me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>
For Iohn baptised wt water: but ye shalbe baptised with the holy goost and that with in this feawe dayes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>
When they were come togeder they axed of him sayinge: Lorde wilt thou at this tyme restore agayne ye kyngdome to Israel?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>
And he sayde vnto them: It is not for you to knowe the tymes or the seasons which ye father hath put in his awne power:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>
but ye shall receave power of the holy goost which shall come on you. And ye shall be witnesses vnto me in Ierusalem and in all Iewrye and in Samary and even vnto the worldes ende.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>
And when he had spoken these thinges whyll they behelde he was take vp and a cloude receaved him vp out of their sight.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>
And while they looked stedfastly vp to heaven as he went beholde two men stode by them in white apparell 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>
which also sayde: ye men of Galile why stonde ye gasinge vp into heave? This same Iesus which is taken vp fro you in to heaven shall so come even as ye haue sene him goo into heaven.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>
Then returned they vnto Ierusalem from mount olivete which is nye to Ierusalem coteyninge a Saboth dayes iorney.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>
And when they were come in they went vp into a parler where abode both Peter and Iames Iohn and Andrew Philip and Thomas Bartlemew and Mathew Iames the sonne of Alpheus and Simo Zelotes and Iudas Iames sonne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>
These all cotinued with one acorde in prayer and supplicacion with the wemen and Mary the mother of Iesu and with his brethren.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>
And in those dayes Peter stode vp in the myddes of the disciples and sayde (the noumbre of names that were to gether were aboute an hondred and twenty)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>
Ye men and brethren this scripture must have nedes ben fulfilled which the holy goost thorow ye mouth of David spake before of Iudas which was gyde to them that tooke Iesus.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>
For he was noubred with vs and had obtayned fellouship in this ministracion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>
And the same hath now possessed a plot of grounde with the rewarde of iniquite and when he was hanged brast a sondre in ye myddes and all his bowels gusshed oute.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>
And it is knowe vnto all the inhabiters of Ierusalem: in so moche that that felde is called in their mother tonge Acheldama that is to saye the bloud felde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>
It is written in the boke of Psalmes: His habitacio be voyde and no man be dwellinge therin: and his bisshoprycke let another take.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>
Wherfore of these me which have copanyed with vs all ye tyme that the Lorde Iesus wet in and out amonge vs
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>
begynninge at the baptyme of Iohn vnto that same daye that he was taken vp from vs must one be ordeyned to be are witnes with vs of his resurreccion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>
And they appoynted two Ioseph called Barsabas (whose syr name was Iustus) and Mathias.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>
And they prayed sayinge: thou Lorde which knowest the hertes of all me shewe whether of these two thou hast chosen
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>
that the one maye take the roume of this ministracion and apostleshippe from the which Iudas by transgression fell that he myght go to his awne place.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>
And they gave forthe their lottes and the lot fell on Mathias and he was counted with the eleven Apostles.

Whe the fyftith daye was come they were all with one accorde togeder in one place.

And sodenly ther cam a sounde from heaven as it had bene the comminge of a myghty wynde and it filled all the housse where they sate.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>
And ther appered vnto them cloven tonges lyke as they had bene fyre and it sate vpon eache of them:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>
and they were all filled with the holy goost and beganne to speake with other tonges even as the sprete gave them vtteraunce.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>
And ther were dwellinge at Ierusalem Iewes devoute men which were of all nacions vnder heaven.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>
When this was noysed aboute the multitude came to gether and were astonyed because that every man hearde the speake his awne touge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>
They wondred all and marveyled sayinge amoge them selves: Beholde are not all these which speake of Galile?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>
And how heare we every man his awne touge wherein we were boren?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>
Parthians Medes and Elamytes and the inhabiters of Mesopotamia of Iury and of Capadocia of Ponthus and Asia

Grekes and Arabians: we have herde them speake with oure awne tonges the greate workes of God.

They were all amased and wondred sayinge one to another: what meaneth this?

Other mocked the sayinge: they are full of newe wyne.

But Peter stepped forth with the eleve and lift vp his voyce and sayde vnto them: Ye men of Iewrye and all ye that inhabite Ierusalem: be this knowe vnto you and with youre eares heare my wordes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>
These are not dronken as ye suppose: for it is yet but the thyrde houre of ye daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>
But this is that which was spoken by ye Prophete Iohel:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>
It shalbe in the last dayes sayth God: of my sprete I will powre out vpon all flesshe. And youre sonnes and youre doughters shall prophesy and youre yoge men shall se visions and youre olde me shall dreme dremes.

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>
And on my servauts and on my honde maydens I will powre out of my sprete in those dayes and they shall prophesye.
</verse>

And I will shewe wonders in heaven a bove and tokens in the erth benethe bloud and fyre and the vapour of smoke.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>
The sunne shalbe turned into darknes and the mone into bloud before that greate and notable daye of the Lorde come.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>
And it shalbe that whosoever shall call on the name of the Lorde shalbe saved.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>
Ye men of Israel heare these wordes. Iesus of Nazareth a ma approved of God amoge you with myracles wondres and signes which God dyd by him in ye myddes of you as ye youre selves knowe:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>
him have ye taken by the hondes of vnrightewes persones after he was delivered by the determinat counsell and foreknoweledge of God and have crucified and slayne:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>
whom God hath raysed vp and lowsed the sorowes of deeth because it was vnpossible that he shuld be holden of it.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>
For David speaketh of him: Afore honde I sawe God alwayes before me: For he is on my ryght honde that I shuld not be moved.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>
Therfore dyd my hert reioyce and my tonge was glad. Moreover also my flesshe shall rest in hope
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>
because thou wilt not leve my soul in hell nether wilt suffre thyne holye to se corrupcio.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>
Thou hast shewed me the wayes of lyfe and shalt make me full of ioye with thy countenaunce.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>
Men and brethren let me frely speake vnto you of the partriarke David: For he is both deed and buryed and his sepulcre remayneth with vs vnto this daye.
</verse>

Therfore seinge he was a Prophet and knewe that God had sworne with an othe to him that the frute of his loynes shuld sit on his seat (in that Christ shulde ryse agayne in the flesshe)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>
he sawe before: and spake in the resurreccion of Christ that his soule shulde not be left in hell: nether his flesse shuld se corrupcio.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>
This Iesus hath God raysyd vp wherof we all are witnesses.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>
Sence now that he by the right honde of God exalted is and hath receaved of the father the promyse of the holy goost he hath sheed forthe that which ye nowe se and heare.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>
For David is not ascendyd into heave: but he sayde. The Lorde sayde to my Lorde sit on my right honde

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>
vntill I make thy fooes thy fote stole.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>
So therfore let all the housse of Israel knowe for a suerty yt God hath made ye same Iesus whom ye have crucified lorde and Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>
When they hearde this they were pricked in their hertes and sayd vnto Peter and vnto the other Apostles: Ye men and brethre what shall we do?
</verse>

Peter sayde vnto them: repent and be baptised every one of you in the name of Iesus Christ for the remission of synnes and ye shall receave the gyfte of the holy goost.

For ye promyse was made vnto you and to youre chyldre and to all that are afarre even as many as ye Lorde oure God shall call.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>
And with many other wordes bare he witnes and exhorted them sayinge: Save youre selves from this vntowarde generacion.

        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>
Then they that gladly receaved his preachynge were baptised: and the same daye ther were added vnto them aboute thre thousande soules.
</verse>

And they continued in the Apostles doctrine and felloushippe and in breakinge of breed and in prayer.

And feare came over every soule. And many wondres and signes were shewed by the Apostles.
</verse>

And all that beleved kept them selves to gedder and had all thinges comen

Peter and Iohn went up togedder into the teple at the nynthe houre of prayer.

And they knewe him that it was he which sate and begged at the beutifull gate of the temple. And they wondred and were sore astonnyed at that which had happened vnto him.

And as ye halt which was healed helde Peter and Iohn all the people ranne amased vnto them in Salomons porche.

When Peter sawe that he answered vnto the people. Ye men of Israel why marvayle ye at this or why looke ye so stedfastly on vs as though by oure awne power or holynes we had made this man goo?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>
The God of Abraham Isaac and Iacob the God of oure fathers hath glorified his sonne Iesus whom ye delyvered and denyed in the presence of Pylate whe he had iudged him to be lowsed.

And they layde hondes on them and put them in holde vntill the nexte daye: for it was now even tyde.

How be it many of them which hearde the wordes beleved and the noumbre of the men was aboute fyve thousande.

This is ye stone cast a syde of you bylders which is set in the chefe place of the corner.

Nether is ther salvacio in eny other. Nor yet also is ther eny other name geven to men wherin we must be saved.

When they sawe the boldnes of Peter and Iohn and vnderstode that they were vnlerned men and laye people they marveyled and they knew them that they were with Iesu:

But that it be noysed no farther amoge the people let us threaten and charge them that they speake hence forth to no man in this name.

And they called them and comaunded them that in no wyse they shuld speake or teache in the name of Iesu.

But Peter and Iohn answered vnto them and sayde: whether it be right in the syght of God to obeye you moare then God iudge ye.

For we canot but speake that which we have sene and hearde.

So threatened they them and let them goo and founde no thinge how to punysshe them because of the people. For all me lauded God for the myracle which was done:

Then came Philip into a cite of Samaria and preached Christ vnto them.

And the people gave hede vnto those thinges which Philip spake with one acorde in that they hearde and sawe the miracles which he dyd.

Then Simon him selfe beleved also and was baptised and cotinued with Phillip and wondered beholdynge the miracles and signes which were shewed.

When ye Apostles which were at Ierusalem hearde saye that Samaria had receaved ye worde of God: they sent vnto the Peter and Iohn

For as yet he was come on none of them: But they were baptised only in the name of Christ Iesu.

Thou hast nether parte nor felloushippe in this busines. For thy hert is not ryght in the syght of God.

For I perceave that thou arte full of bitter gall and wrapped in iniquite.

Then answered Simon and sayde: Praye ye to the lorde for me yt none of these thinges whiche ye have spoken fall on me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.8.25'>
And they whe they had testified and preached the worde of the lorde returned toward Ierusalem and preached the gospell in many cities of the Samaritas.

The tenoure of ye scripture which he redde was this. He was ledde as a shepe to be slayne: and lyke a lambe dome before his sherer so opened he not his mouth.

Because of his humblenes he was not estemed: who shall declare his generacio? for his lyfe is taken fro the erthe.

The chamberlayne answered Philip and sayde: I praye the of whom speaketh the Prophet this? of him selfe or of some other man?

And Philip opened his mouth and beganne at ye same scripture and preached vnto him Iesus.

And he comaunded the charet to stonde still. And they went doune bothe into the water: bothe Philip and also the chamberlayne and he baptised him.
