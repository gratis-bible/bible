        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>
And he charged him and sent him awaye forthwith
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>
and sayd vnto him: Se thou saye no thinge to any man: but get the hence and shewe thy silfe to ye preste and offer for thy clensinge those thinges which Moses comaunded for a testimoniall vnto them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>
But he (assone as he was departed) beganne to tell many thinges and to publyshe the dede: in so moche that Iesus coulde no more opely entre in to the cite but was with out in desert places. And they came to him fro every quarter.

And there came vnto him that brought one sicke of the palsie borne of fower men.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>
And because they coulde not come nye vnto him for preace they vncovered ye rofe of the housse where he was. And when they had broken it ope they let doune ye beed where in ye sicke of the palsie laye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>
When Iesus sawe their fayth he sayde to the sicke of the palsie sonne thy sinnes are forgeven the.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>
And ther were certayne of ye scribes sittinge there and reasoninge in their hertes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>
how doeth this felowe so blaspheme? Who can forgeve synnes but God only?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>
And immediatly whe Iesus perceaved in his sprete yt they so reasoned in the selves he sayde vnto them: why thynke ye soche thinges in youre hertes?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>
Whether is it easyer to saye to ye sicke of ye palsie thy synnes are forgeven the or to saye aryse take vp thy beed and walke?

That ye maye knowe yt the sonne of man hath power in erth to forgeve synnes he spake vnto ye sicke of the palsie:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>
I saye vnto ye aryse and take vp thy beed and get ye hense into thyne awne housse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>
And by and by he arose toke vp the beed and went forth before them all: in so moche that they were all amased and glorified God sayinge: we never sawe it on this fassion.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>
And he went agayne vnto the see and all the people resorted vnto him and he taught the.

        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>
And when the Scribes and Pharises sawe him eate with publicas and synnere they sayde vnto his disciples: how is it that he eateth and drynketh with publicas and synners?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>
When Iesus hearde yt he sayde vnto them. The whole have no nede of the phisicio but the sicke. I came not to call the rightwise but the synners to repentaunce.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>
And the disciples of Iohn and the Pharises dyd faste: and therfore came and sayde vnto him. Why do ye disciples of Iohn and of the Pharises faste and thy disciples fast not.
</verse>

And Iesus sayde vnto them: can the chyldren of a weddinge faste while the brydgrome is wt them. As longe as they have the brydgrome with them they cannot faste.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>
But the dayes will come when the brydgrome shalbe taken from them and then shall they faste in those dayes.
 21 Also no ma soweth a pece of newe cloth vnto an olde garmet for then taketh he awaye ye newe pece fro the olde and so is the rent worsse.
 22 In lyke wyse no man poureth newe wyne into olde vessels: for yf he do the newe wyne breaketh the vessels and the wyne runneth out and the vessels are marred. But new wyne must be poured into new vessels.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>
And it chaunsed that he wet thorow ye corne feldes on the Saboth daye: and his disciples as they went on their waye beganne to plucke the eares of corne.

How he went into the housse of God in the dayes of Abiathar ye hye preste and dyd eate ye halowed loves which is not laufull to eate but for ye prestes only: and gave also to the which were with him?
