      <chapter osisID='Heb.1'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.1'>
God in tyme past diversly and many wayes spake vnto the fathers by Prophetes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.2'>
but in these last dayes he hath spoken vnto vs by his sonne whom he hath made heyre of all thinges: by who also he made the worlde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.3'>
Which sonne beynge the brightnes of his glory and very ymage of his substance bearinge vp all thinges with the worde of his power hath in his awne person pourged oure synnes and is sitten on the right honde of the maiestie an hye
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.4'>
and is more excellent then the angels in as moche as he hath by inheritaunce obteyned an excellenter name then have they.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.5'>
For vnto which of the angels sayde he ateny tyme: Thou arte my sonne this daye be gate I the? And agayne: I will be his father and he shalbe my sonne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.6'>
And agayne whe he bringeth in the fyrst begotten sonne in to the worlde he sayth: And all the angels of God shall worshippe him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.7'>
And of the angels he sayth: He maketh his angels spretes and his ministres flammes of fyre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.8'>
But vnto the sonne he sayth: God thy seate shalbe forever and ever. The cepter of thy kyngdome is a right cepter.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.9'>
Thou hast loved rightewesnes and hated iniquyte. Wherfore God which is thy God hath anoynted the with ye oyle of gladnes above thy felowes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.10'>
And thou Lorde in the begynninge hast layde the foundacion of the erth. And the heves are the workes of thy hondes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.11'>
They shall perisshe but thou shalt endure. They all shall wexe olde as doth a garment:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.12'>
and as a vesture shalt thou chaunge them and they shalbe chaunged. But thou arte all wayes and thy yeres shall not fayle.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.13'>
Vnto which of the angels sayde he at eny tyme? Sit on my ryght honde tyll I make thyne enemyes thy fote stole.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.1.14'>
Are they not all mynistrynge spretes sent to minister for their sakes which shalbe heyres of salvacion?
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.2'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.1'>
Wherfore we ought to geve ye more hede to ye thinges we have herde lest we perysshe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.2'>
For yf the worde which was spoke by angels was stedfast: so yt every trasgressio and disobediece receaved a iust recopece to rewarde:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.3'>
how shall we escape yf we despyse so great saluacio which at ye fyrst bega to be preached of ye lorde him silfe and afterwarde was cofermed vnto vs warde by the ye hearde it
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.4'>
god bearynge witnes therto bothe with sygnes and wonders also and with divers miracles and gyftes of the holy gooste accordynge to his awne will.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.5'>
He hath not vnto the angels put in subieccion the worlde to come where of we speake.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.6'>
But one in a certayne place witnessed sayinge. What is man that thou arte myndfull of him?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.7'>
After thou haddest for a season made him lower then the angels: thou crounedst him with honour and glory and hast set him above the workes of thy hondes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.8'>
Thou hast put all thynges in subieccion vnder his fete. In that he put all thynges vnder him he left nothynge that is not put vnder him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.9'>
Neverthelesse we yet se not all thynges subdued but him yt was made lesse the ye angelles: we se that it was Iesus which is crouned with glory and honour for the sofferinge of death: that he by the grace of god shulde tast of deeth for all men.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.10'>
For it becam him for whom are all thynges and by whom are all thynges after that he had brought many sonnes vnto glory that he shuld make the lorde of their saluacion parfect thorow sofferynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.11'>
For he that sanctifieth and they which are sanctified are all of one. For which causes sake he is not ashamde to call the brethren
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.12'>
sayinge: I will declare thy name vnto my brethren and in the myddes of the congregacio will I prayse the.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.13'>
And agayne: I will put my trust in him. And agayne. beholde here am I and the children which god hath geven me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.14'>
For as moche then as the children were parte takers of flesshe and bloud he also him silfe lyke wyse toke parte with them for to put doune thorow deth him that had lordshippe over deeth that is to saye the devyll
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.15'>
and yt he myght delyver the which thorow feare of deeth were all their lyfetyme in dauger of bondage.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.16'>
For he in no place taketh on him the angels: but the seede of Abraham taketh he on him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.17'>
Wherfore in all thynges it became him to be made lyke vnto his brethre that he myght be mercifull and a faythfull hye preste in thynges concernynge god for to pourge the peoples synnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.2.18'>
For in that he him silfe suffered and was tempted he is able to sucker them that are tempted.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.3'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.1'>
Wherfore holy brethren partakers of the celestiall callinge cosyder the embasseatour and hye prest of oure profession Christ Iesus
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.2'>
which was faythfull to him that made him even as was Moses in all his housse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.3'>
And this man was counted worthy of more glory then Moses: In as moche as he which hath prepared the housse hath most honoure in the housse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.4'>
Every housse is prepared of some man. But he that ordeyned all thinges is god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.5'>
And Moses verely was faythfull in all his housse as a minister to beare witnes of tho thinges which shuld be spoken afterwarde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.6'>
But Christ as a sonne hath rule over the housse whose housse are we so that we hold fast the confydence and the reioysynge of that hope vnto the ende.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.7'>
Wherfore as the holy goost sayth: to daye if ye shall heare his voyce
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.8'>
harden not youre hertes after the rebellyon in the daye of temptacion in the wildernes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.9'>
where youre fathers tempted me proved me and sawe my workes xl. yeare longe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.10'>
Wherfore I was greved wt ye generacio and sayde. They erre ever in their hertes: they verely have not knowe my wayes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.11'>
so that I sware in my wrathe that they shuld not enter into my rest.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.12'>
Take hede brethren that therbe in none of you an evyll herte in vnbeleve that he shuld departe from ye lyvynge god:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.13'>
but exhorte one another dayly whill is it called to daye lest eny of you wexe harde herted thorow ye deceytfullnesse of sinne
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.14'>
We are partetakers of Christ yf we kepe sure vnto the ende the fyrst substance
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.15'>
so longe as it is sayd: to daye yf ye heare his voyce harde not youre hertes as when ye rebelled.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.16'>
For some whe they hearde rebelled: howbe it not all yt ca out of Egypt vnder Moses.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.17'>
But with who was he despleased .xl. yeares? Was he not displeased with them that synned: whose carkases were overthorwen in the desert?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.18'>
To whom sware he that they shuld not enter into his rest: but vnto them that beleved not?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.3.19'>
And we se that they coulde not enter in because of vnbeleve.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.4'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.1'>
Let vs feare therfore lest eny of vs forsakynge the promes of entrynge into his rest shulde seme to come behinde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.2'>
For vnto vs was it declared as well as vnto them. But it proffited not them that they hearde the worde because they which hearde it coupled it not with fayth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.3'>
But we which have beleved do enter into his rest as contrarywyse he sayde to the other: I have sworne in my wrath they shall not enter into my rest. And that spake he verely longe after that the workes were made and the foudacio of ye worlde layde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.4'>
For he spake in a certayne place of ye seveth daye on this wyse: And god did rest ye seventh daye fro all his workes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.5'>
And in this place agayne: They shall not come into my rest.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.6'>
Seynge therfore it foloweth that some muste enter therinto and they to who it was fyrst preached entred not therin for vnbeleves sake.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.7'>
Agayne he apoynteth in David a certayne present daye after so longe a tyme sayinge as it is rehearsed: this daye if ye heare his voyce be not harde herted.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.8'>
For if Iosue had geven them rest then wolde he not afterwarde have spoke of another daye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.9'>
There remayneth therfore yet a rest to ye people of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.10'>
For he yt is is entred into his rest doth cease from his awne workes as god did from his.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.11'>
Let vs study therfore to entre into that rest lest eny man faule after the same ensample in to vnbelefe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.12'>
For the worde of god is quycke and myghty in operacion and sharper then eny two edged swearde: and entreth through even vnto the dividynge asonder of the soule and the sprete and of the ioyntes and the mary: and iudgeth the thoughtes and the intentes of the herte:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.13'>
nether is there eny creature invisible in the sight of it. For all thynges are naked and bare vnto the eyes of him of who we speake.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.14'>
Seynge then that we have a great hye prest whych is entred into heven (I meane Iesus the sonne of God) let vs holde oure profession.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.15'>
For we have not an hye prest which can not have compassion on oure infirmities: but was in all poyntes tempted lyke as we are: but yet with out synne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.4.16'>
Let vs therfore goo boldely vnto the seate of grace that we maye receave mercy and fynde grace to helpe in tyme of nede.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.5'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.1'>
For every hye prest that is taken from amoge men is ordeyned for men in thynges pertaynynge to god: to offer gyftes and sacryfyses for synne:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.2'>
which can have compassion on the ignoraunt and on them that are out of the waye because that he him silfe also is compased with infirmitie:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.3'>
For the which infirmities sake he is bounde to offer for synnes as well for hys awne parte as for the peoples.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.4'>
And no man taketh honour vnto him silfe but he that is called of God as was Aaron.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.5'>
Even so lykewise Christ glorified not him silfe to be made the hye prest: but he that sayde vnto him: thou arte my sonne this daye begat I the glorified him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.6'>
As he also in another place speaketh: Thou arte a prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.7'>
Which in the dayes of his flesshe did offer vp prayers and sup plicacions with stronge cryinge and teares vnto him that was able to save him from deeth: and was also hearde because of his godlines.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.8'>
And though he were Goddes sonne yet learned he obediece by tho thynges which he suffered
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.9'>
and was made parfaite and the cause of eternall saluacion vnto all them that obey him:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.10'>
and is called of God an hye prest after the order of Melchisedech.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.11'>
Wherof we have many thynges to saye which are harde to be vttered: because ye are dull of hearinge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.12'>
For when as cocerninge ye tyme ye ought to be teachers yet have ye nede agayne that we teache you the fyrst principles of the worde of god: and are become soche as have nede of mylke and not of stronge meate:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.13'>
For every man that is feed with mylke is inexperte in the worde of rightewesnes. For he is but a babe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.5.14'>
But stronge meate belongeth to them that are parfecte which thorow custome have their wittes exercised to iudge both good and evyll also.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.6'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.1'>
Wherfore let vs leave ye doctryne pertayninge to the beginninge of a Christen man and let vs go vnto perfeccio and now no more laye the foundacio of repentaunce from deed workes and of fayth towarde God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.2'>
of baptyme of doctryne and of layinge on of hondes and of resurreccion from deeth and of eternall iudgemet.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.3'>
And so will we do yf God permitte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.4'>
For it is not possible yt they which were once lyghted and have tasted of the hevenly gyft and were become partetakers of the holy goost
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.5'>
and have tasted of the good worde of God and of the power of the worlde to come:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.6'>
yf they faule shuld be renued agayne vnto repentaunce: for as moche as they have (as concerninge them selves) crucified the sonne of God a fresshe makynge a mocke of him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.7'>
For that erth which drinketh in the rayne wich cometh ofte vpon it and bringeth forth erbes mete for them that dresse it receaveth blessynge of god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.8'>
But that grounde which beareth thornes and bryars is reproved and is nye vnto cursynge: whose ende is to be burned.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.9'>
Neverthelesse deare frendes we trust to se better of you and thynges which accompany saluacion though we thus speake.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.10'>
For god is not vnrighteous that he shuld forget youre worke and laboure that procedeth of love which love shewed in his name which have ministred vnto the saynctes and yet minister
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.11'>
Yee and we desyre that every one of you shew the same diligence to the stablysshynge of hope even vnto the ende:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.12'>
that ye faynt not but folowe them which thorow fayth and pacience inheret the promyses.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.13'>
For when god made promes to Abraham because he had no greater thinge to sweare by he sware by him silfe
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.14'>
sayinge: Surely I will blesse the and multiply the in dede.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.15'>
And so after that he had taryed a longe tyme he enioyed the promes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.16'>
Men verely sweare by him that is greater then them selves and an othe to confyrme the thynge ys amonge them an ende of all stryfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.17'>
So god willynge very aboundanly to shewe vnto the heyres of promes the stablenes of his counsayle he added an othe
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.18'>
that by two immutable thinges (in which it was vnpossible that god shuld lye) we myght have parfect consolacion which have fled for to holde fast the hope that is set before vs
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.19'>
which hope we have as an ancre of the soule both sure and stedfast. Which hope also entreth in into tho thynges which are with in the vayle
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.6.20'>
whither ye fore runner is for vs entred in I mea Iesus that is made an hye prest for ever after the order of Melchisedech.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Heb.7'>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.1'>
This Melchisedech kynge of Salem (which beinge prest of ye most hye god met Abraham as he returned agayne from the slaughter of the kynges and blessed him:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.2'>
to whom also Abraham gave tythes of all thynges) fyrst is by interpretacion kynge of rightewesnes: after yt he is kynge of Sale yt is to saye kynge of peace
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.3'>
with out father wt out mother with out kynne and hath nether begynnynge of his tyme nether yet ende of his lyfe: but is lykened vnto the sonne of god and cotinueth a preste for ever.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.4'>
Consyder what a man this was vnto who the patriarke Abraham gave tythes of the spoyles.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.5'>
And verely those children of levy which receave the office of the prestes have a commaundement to take a cordyng to the lawe tythes of the people that is to saye of their brethren yee though they spronge out of the loynes of Abraham.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.6'>
But he whose kynred is not counted amonge them receaved tythes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promyses.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.7'>
And no man denyeth but that which is lesse receaveth blessinge of yt which is greater.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.8'>
And here men that dye receave tythes. But there he receaveth tythes of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.9'>
And to saye the trueth Levy him silfe also which receaveth tythes payed tythes in Abraham.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.10'>
For he was yet in the loynes of his father Abraham when Melchisech met him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.11'>
Yf now therfore perfeccion came by the presthod of the levites (for vnder that presthod the people recaved the lawe) what neded it furthermore that an other prest shuld ryse after the order of Melchisedech and not after the order of Aaron?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.12'>
Now no dout yf the presthod be translated then of necessitie must the lawe be translated also.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.13'>
For he of whom these thynges are spoken pertayneth vnto another trybe of which never man served at the aultre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.14'>
For it is evidet that oure lorde spronge of the trybe of Iuda of which trybe spake Moses nothynge concernynge presthod.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.15'>
And it is yet a more evydent thinge yf after the similitude of Melchisedech ther aryse a nother prest
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.16'>
which is not made after the lawe of the carnall commaundmet: but after the power of the endlesse lyfe
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.17'>
(For he testifieth: Thou arte a prest forever after the order of Melchysedech)
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.18'>
Then the commaundmet that went a fore is disanulled because of hir weaknes and vnproffitablenes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.7.19'>

Wherfore let vs also (seynge that we are copased with so great a multitude of witnesses) laye awaye all that presseth doune and the synne that hageth on and let vs rune with paciece vnto the battayle yt is set before vs
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.2'>
lokynge vnto Iesus the auctor and fynnyssher of oure fayth which for the ioye that was set before him abode the crosse and despysed the shame and is set doune on the right honde of ye trone of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.3'>
Consider therfore how that he endured suche speakinge agaynst him of synners lest ye shuld be weried and faynte in youre myndes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.4'>
For ye have not yet resisted vnto bloud sheddinge stryvinge agaynst synne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.5'>
And ye have forgotten the consolacion which speaketh vnto you as vnto chyldren: My sonne despyse not the chastenynge of the Lorde nether faynt when thou arte rebuked of him:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.6'>
For whom the Lorde loveth him he chasteneth: yee and he scourgeth every sonne that he receaveth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.7'>
Yf ye endure chastninge God offereth him selfe vnto you as vnto sonnes. What sonne is that whom the father chasteneth not?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.8'>
If ye be not vnder correccio (where of all are part takers) then are ye bastardes and not sonnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.9'>
Moreover seynge we had fathers of oure flesshe which corrected vs and we gave them reverence: shuld we not moche rather be in subieccion vnto the father of spretuall gyftes that we myght live?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.10'>

Stretch forthe therfore agayne the hondes which were let doune and the weake knees
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.13'>
and se that ye have strayght steppes vnto youre fete lest eny haltinge turne out of ye waye: yee let it rather be healed.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.14'>
Embrace peace with all men and holynes: with out the which no man shall se the Lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.15'>
And looke to that no man be destitue of the grace of God and that no rote of bitternes springe vp and trouble and therby many be defiled:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.16'>
and that there be no fornicator or vnclene person as Esau which for one breakfast solde his birthright.

Ye knowe how that afterwarde when he wolde have inherited the blessinge he was put by and he foude no meanes to come therby agayne: no though he desyred it with teares.
</verse>

For ye are not come vnto the mounte that can be touched and vnto burninge fyre nor yet to myst and darcknes and tempest of wedder
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.19'>
nether vnto the sounde of a trope and the voyce of wordes: which voyce they that hearde it wisshed awaye that the comunicacion shuld not be spoken to them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.20'>
For they were not able to abyde that which was spoken. If a beast had touched the mountayne it must have bene stoned or thrust thorowe with a darte:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.21'>
eve so terreble was ye sight which appered. Moses sayde I feare and quake.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.22'>
But ye are come vnto the moute Sion and to the citie of the livinge god the celestiall Ierusalem: and to an innumerable sight of angels

and to Iesus the mediator of the newe testament and to the spryncklynge of bloud that speaketh better then the bloud of Abell.

whose voyce the shouke the erth and now declareth sayinge: yet once more will I shake not the erth only but also heven.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.27'>
No dout yt same that he sayth yet once more signifieth the removinge a waye of those thinges which are shaken as of thinges which have ended their course: that the thynges which are not shaken maye remayne. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.28'>
Wherfore if we receave a kyngdom which is not moved we have grace wherby we maye serve god and please him with reverence and godly feare.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Heb.12.29'>
For oure god is a consumynge fyre.
