For as moche as many have take in hand to compyle a treates of thoo thinges which are surely knowen amonge vs
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>
even as they declared them vnto vs which from the beginnynge sawe them their selves and were ministers at the doyng:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>
I determined also assone as I had searched out diligently all thinges from the beginnynge that then I wolde wryte vnto the good Theophilus:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>
that thou myghtest knowe the certente of thoo thinges wher of thou arte informed.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>
There was in the dayes of Herode kynge of Iurie a certayne prest named Zacharias of ye course of Abia. And his wyfe was of ye doughters of Aaron: And her name was Elizabeth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>
Booth were perfect before God and walked in all the lawes and ordinaces of the Lorde that no man coulde fynde fawte with them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>
And they had no chylde because that Elizabeth was barre and booth were well stricken in age.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>
And it cam to passe as he executed the prestes office before god as his course came
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>
(accordinge to the custome of the prestes office) his lot was to bourne incece.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>
And wet into ye teple of ye Lorde and the whoale multitude of ye people were with out in prayer whill the incense was aburnynge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>
And ther appered vnto him an angell of the lorde stondinge on the ryght syde of the altare of incense.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>
And when Zacharias sawe him he was abasshed and feare came on him.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>
And the angell sayde vnto him: feare not Zachary for thy prayer is hearde: And thy wyfe Elizabeth shall beare ye a sonne and thou shalt call his name Iohn
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>
and thou shalt have ioye and gladnes and many shall reioyce at his birth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>
For he shalbe greate in the sight of the lorde and shall nether drinke wyne ner stronge drinke. And he shalbe filled with the holy goost even in his mothers wombe:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>
and many of the chyldren of Israel shall he tourne to their Lorde God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>
And he shall goo before him in the sprete and power of Helyas to tourne the hertes of the fathers to the chyldren and the vnbelevers to the wysdom of the iuste men: to make the people redy for the Lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>
And Zacharias sayde vnto ye angell: Wher by shall I knowe this? seinge that I am olde and my wyfe well stricken in yeares.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>
And the angell answered and sayde vnto him: I am Gabriell that stonde in the presens of God and am sent to speake vnto the: and to shewe the these glad tydinges.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>
And beholde thou shalt be domme and not able to speake vntyll the tyme that these thinges be performed because thou belevedst not my wordes which shalbe fulfilled in their season.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>
And the people wayted for Zacharias and mervelled that he taryed in the temple.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>
And whe he cam oute he could not speake vnto them. Wherby they perceaved that he had sene some vision in the temple. And he beckened vnto them and remayned speachlesse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>
And it fortuned assone as ye tyme of his office was oute he departed home into his awne housse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>
And after thoose dayes his wyfe Elizabeth coceaved and hyd her sylfe .v. monethes sayinge:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>
This wyse hath God dealte wt me in ye dayes when he loked on me to take from me the rebuke yt I suffred amonge men.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>
And in ye .vi. moneth ye angell Gabriel was sent fro god vnto a cite of Galile named Nazareth
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>
to a virgin spoused to a man whose name was Ioseph of ye housse of David and ye virgins name was Mary.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>
And ye angell went in vnto her and sayde: Hayle full of grace ye Lorde is with ye: blessed arte thou amonge wemen.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>
When she sawe him she was abasshed at his sayinge: and cast in her mynde what maner of salutacion yt shuld be.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>
And ye angell sayde vnto her: feare not Mary: for thou hast founde grace wt god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>
Loo: thou shalt coceave in thy wombe and shalt beare a sonne and shalt call his name Iesus.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>
He shalbe greate and shalbe called the sonne of the hyest. And ye lorde God shall geve vnto him the seate of his father David
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>
and he shall raygne over ye housse of Iacob forever and of his kyngdome shalbe none ende.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>
Then sayd Mary vnto ye angell: How shall this be seinge I knowe not a man?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>
And ye angell answered and sayd vnto her: The holy goost shall come apon the and ye power of ye hyest shall over shaddowe ye. Therfore also yt holy thinge which shalbe borne shalbe called ye sonne of god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>
And beholde thy cosen Elizabeth she hath also conceaved a sonne in her age. And this is hyr sixte moneth though she be called barren:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>
for wt god can nothinge be vnpossible.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>
And Mary sayd: beholde ye honde mayden of ye lorde be it vnto me even as thou hast sayde. And the angell departed from her.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>
And Mary arose in thoose dayes and went into ye mountayns wt hast into a cite of Iurie
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>
and entred into the housse of zachary and saluted Elizabeth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>
And it fortuned as Elizabeth hearde ye salutacion of Mary the babe spronge in her belly. And Elizabeth was filled with the holy goost
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>
and cryed with a loude voyce and sayde: Blessed arte thou amonge wemen and blessed is the frute of thy wombe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>
And whence hapeneth this to me that the mother of my Lorde shuld come to me?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>
For loo assone as the voyce of thy salutacion sownded in myne eares the babe sprange in my belly for ioye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>
And blessed arte thou that belevedst: for thoose thinges shalbe performed wich were tolde ye from the lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>
And Mary sayde. My soule magnifieth the Lorde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>
And my sprete reioyseth in god my savioure
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>
For he hath loked on the povre degre of his honde mayde. Beholde now from hence forth shall all generacions call me blessed.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>
For he that is myghty hath done to me greate thinges and holye is his name.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>
And his mercy is on them that feare him thorow oute all generacions.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>
He sheweth strength with his arme he scattereth them that are proude in the ymaginacion of their hertes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>
He putteth doune the myghty from their seates and exalteth them of lowe degre.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>
He filleth the hongry with good thinges: and sendeth awaye the ryche emptye.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>
He remenbreth mercy: and helpeth his servaunt Israel.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>
Even as he promised to oure fathers Abraham and to his seede for ever.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>
And mary aboode with hyr aboute a .iii. monethes and retourned agayne to hyr awne housse.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>
Elizabethes tyme was come that she shuld be delyvered and she brought forth a sonne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>
And her neghboures and her cosins hearde tell how the lorde had shewed great mercy vpon her and they reioysed with her.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>
And it fortuned ye eyght daye: they cam to circumcise the chylde: and called his name zacharias after the name of his father.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>
How be it his mother answered and sayd: not so but he shalbe called Ihon.

And they sayd vnto hyr: Ther is none of thy kynne that is named wt this name.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>
And they made signes to his father how he wolde have him called.

And he axed for wrytynge tables and wroote saying: his name is Iohn. And they marvelled all.

And his mouthe was opened immediatly and his tonge also and he spake lawdynge God.

And it chaunced in thoose dayes: yt ther went oute a comaundment from Auguste the Emperour that all the woorlde shuld be taxed.

And this taxynge was ye fyrst and executed when Syrenius was leftenaut in Syria.

And every man went vnto his awne citie to be taxed.
