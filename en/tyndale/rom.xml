Paul the seruaut of Iesus Christ called to be an Apostle put a parte to preache the Gospell of God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.2'>
which he promysed afore by his Prophetes in the holy scriptures
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.3'>
that make mension of his sonne the which was begotte of the seed of David as pertayninge to the flesshe:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.4'>
and declared to be the sonne of God with power of the holy goost that sanctifieth sence ye tyme that Iesus Christ oure Lorde rose agayne from deeth
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.5'>
by whom we have receaved grace and apostleshyppe to bringe all maner hethe people vnto obedience of the fayth that is in his name:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.6'>
of the which hethen are ye a part also which are Iesus christes by vocacio.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.7'>
To all you of Rome beloved of God and saynctes by callinge. Grace be with you and peace from God oure father and from the Lorde Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.8'>
Fyrst verely I thanke my God thorow Iesus Christ for you all because youre fayth is publisshed through out all the worlde.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.9'>
For God is my witnes whom I serve with my sprete in the Gospell of his sonne that with out ceasinge I make mencion of you alwayes in my prayers
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.10'>
besechinge that at one tyme or another a prosperous iorney (by ye will of god) myght fortune me to come vnto you.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.11'>
For I longe to see you that I myght bestowe amoge you some spirituall gyfte to strength you with all:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.12'>
that is that I myght have consolacion together with you through the commen fayth which bothe ye and I have.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.13'>
I wolde that ye shuld knowe brethre how that I have often tymes purposed to come vnto you (but have bene let hitherto) to have some frute amonge you as I have amonge other of ye Gentyls.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.14'>
For I am detter both to the Grekes and to them which are no Grekes vnto the learned and also vnto the vnlearned.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.15'>
Lykewyse as moche as in me is I am redy to preache the Gospell to you of Rome also.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.16'>
For I am not ashamed of the Gospell of Christ because it is ye power of God vnto salvacio to all yt beleve namely to the Iewe and also to ye getyle.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.17'>
For by it ye rightewesnes which cometh of god is opened fro fayth to fayth. As it is written: The iust shall live by fayth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.18'>
For the wrath of God apereth from heven agaynst all vngodlynes and vnrightewesnes of me which withholde ye trueth in vnrightewesnes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.19'>
seynge what maye be knowen of God that same is manifest amoge them. For God dyd shewe it vnto them.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.20'>
So that his invisible thinges: that is to saye his eternall power and godhed are vnderstonde and sene by the workes from the creacion of the worlde. So that they are without excuse
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.21'>
in as moche as when they knewe god they glorified him not as God nether were thakfull but wexed full of vanities in their imaginacions and their folisshe hertes were blynded.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.23'>
When they couted them selves wyse they became foles and turned the glory of the immortall god vnto the similitude of the ymage of mortall man and of byrdes and foure foted beastes and of serpentes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.24'>
Wherfore god lykewyse gave the vp vnto their hertes lustes vnto vnclennes to defyle their awne boddyes bitwene them selves:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.25'>
which tourned his truthe vnto a lye and worshipped and served the creatures more then ye maker which is blessed for ever. Ame.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.26'>
For this cause god gave them vp vnto shamfull lustes. For even their wemen did chaunge the naturall vse vnto the vnnaturall.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.27'>
And lyke wyse also the men lefte the naturall vse of the woma and bret in their lustes one on another. And man with man wrought filthynes and receaved in them selves the rewarde of their erroure as it was accordinge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.28'>
And as it semed not good vnto them to be aknowen of God even so God delivered them vp vnto a leawde mynd yt they shuld do tho thinges which were not comly
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.29'>
beinge full of all vnrighteous doinge of fornicacio wickednes coveteousnes maliciousnes full of envie morther debate disseyte evill codicioned whisperers
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.30'>
backbyters haters of God doers of wroge proude bosters bringers vp of evyll thinges disobedient to father and mother 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.31'>
with out vnderstondinge covenaunte breakers vnlovinge trucebreakers and merciles.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.1.32'>
Which me though they knew the rightewesnes of God how that they which soche thinges commyt are worthy of deeth yet not only do the same but also have pleasure in them that do them.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.1'>
Therfore arte thou inexcusable o man whosoever thou be yt iudgest. For in ye same wherin thou iudgest another thou condemnest thy selfe. For thou that iudgest doest eve the same selfe thinges
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.2'>
But we are sure that the iudgement of God is accordinge to trueth agaynst them which commit soche thinges.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.3'>
Thikest thou this O thou ma that iudgest them which do soche thinges and yet doest eve the very same yt thou shalt escape ye iudgemet of God?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.4'>
Ether despisest thou the riches of his goodnes paciece and longe sufferaunce? and remembrest not how that the kyndnes of God ledith the to repentaunce?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.5'>
But thou after thyne harde herte yt canot repet heapest ye togedder the treasure of wrath agaynste the daye of vengeauce when shalbe opened ye rightewes iudgemet of god
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.6'>
which will rewarde every ma accordinge to his dedes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.7'>
that is to saye prayse honoure and immortalite to them which cotinue in good doynge and seke eternall lyfe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.8'>
But vnto them that are rebellious and disobey the trueth yet folowe iniquytie shall come indignacion and wrath
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.9'>
tribulacion and anguysshe vpon the soule of every man that doth evyll: of the Iewe fyrst and also of the gentyll.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.10'>
To every man that doth good shall come prayse honoure and peace to ye Iewe fyrst and also to the gentyll.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.11'>
For ther is no parcialyte with god. But whosoever hath synned with out lawe shall perisshe wt out lawe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.12'>
And as many as haue synned vnder the lawe shalbe iudged by the lawe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.13'>
For before god they are not ryghteous which heare ye lawe: but the doers of the lawe shalbe iustified.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.14'>
For if the gentyls which have no lawe do of nature the thynges contayned in the lawe: then they havynge no lawe are a lawe vnto them selves
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.15'>
which shewe the dede of the lawe wrytten in their hertes: whyll their conscience beareth witnes vnto them and also their thoughtes accusynge one another or excusynge
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.16'>
at the daye when god shall iudge the secretes of men by Iesus Christ accordinge to my Gospell.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.17'>
Beholde thou arte called a Iewe and trustest in the lawe and reioysist in God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.18'>
and knowest his will and hast experience of good and bad in that thou arte informed by the lawe:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.19'>
and belevest that thou thy silfe arte a gyde vnto the blynde a lyght to them which are in darcknes
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.20'>
an informer of them which lacke discrecio a teacher of vnlearned which hast the ensample of that which ought to be knowen and of the truth in the lawe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.21'>
But thou which teachest another teachest not thy selfe. Thou preachest a man shuld not steale: and yet thou stealest.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.22'>
Thou sayst a man shuld not commit advoutry: and thou breakest wedlocke. Thou abhorrest ymages and robbest God of his honoure.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.23'>
Thou reioysest in the lawe and thorow breakinge the lawe dishonourest God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.24'>
For the name of god is evyll spoken of amonge the Gentyls thorowe you as it is written. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.25'>
Circumcisio verely avayleth if thou kepe the lawe. But if thou breake the lawe thy circumcision is made vncircumcision.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.26'>
Therfore if the vncircumcised kepe the ryght thinges contayned in the lawe: shall not his vncircumcision be counted for circumcision?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.27'>
And shall not vncircumcision which is by nature (yf it kepe the lawe) iudge the which beynge vnder the letter and circumcision dost transgresse the lawe?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.28'>
For he is not a Iewe which is a Iewe out warde. Nether is that thynge circumcision which is outwarde in the flesshe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.2.29'>
But he is a Iewe which is hid wythin and the circucisio of ye herte is the true circumcision which is in the sprete and not in ye letter whose prayse is not of men but of god.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.1'>
What preferment then hath the Iewe? other what a vauntageth circumcision?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.2'>
Surely very moche. Fyrst vnto them was committed the worde of God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.3'>
What then though some of them did not beleve? shall their vnbeleve make the promes of god with out effecte?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.4'>
God forbid. Let god be true and all men lyars as it is written: That thou myghtest be iustifyed in thy sayinge and shuldest overcome when thou arte iudged.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.5'>
Yf oure vnrightewesnes make the rightewesnes of God more excellent: what shall we saye? Is God vnrighteous which taketh vengeauce? I speake after the maner of me.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.6'>
God forbid. For how then shall God iudge the worlde?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.7'>
Yf the veritie of God appere moare excellent thorow my lye vnto his prayse why am I hence forth iudged as a synner?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.8'>
and saye not rather (as men evyll speake of vs and as some affirme that we saye) let vs do evyll that good maye come therof. Whose damnacion is iuste.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.9'>
What saye we then? Are we better then they? No in no wyse. For we have all ready proved how that both Iewes and Gentils are all vnder synne
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.10'>
as it is writte: There is none righteous no not one:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.11'>
There is none that vnderstondith there is none yt seketh after God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.12'>
they are all gone out of ye waye they are all made vnprofytable ther is none that doeth good no not one.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.13'>
Their throte is an open sepulchre with their tounges they have disceaved: the poyson of Aspes is vnder their lippes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.14'>
Whose mouthes are full of coursynge and bitternes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.15'>
Their fete are swyfte to sheed bloud.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.16'>
Destruccion and wretchednes are in their wayes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.17'>
And the waye of peace they have not knowen.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.18'>
There is no feare of God before their eyes. 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.19'>
Ye and we knowe that whatsoever ye lawe sayth he sayth it to them which are vnder the lawe. That all mouthes maye be stopped and all the worlde be subdued to god
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.20'>
because that by ye dedes of the lawe shall no flesshe be iustified in the sight of God. For by the lawe commeth the knowledge of synne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.21'>
Now verely is ye rigtewesnes that cometh of God declared without the fulfillinge of ye lawe havinge witnes yet of ye lawe and of the Prophetes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.22'>
The rightewesnes no dout which is good before God cometh by ye fayth of Iesus Christ vnto all and vpon all that beleve.Ther is no differece:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.23'>
for all have synned and lacke the prayse yt is of valoure before God:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.24'>
but are iustified frely by his grace through the redemcion that is in Christ Iesu
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.25'>
whom God hath made a seate of mercy thorow faith in his bloud to shewe ye rightewesnes which before him is of valoure in yt he forgeveth ye synnes yt are passed which God dyd suffre 
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.26'>
to shewe at this tyme ye rightewesnes yt is alowed of him yt he myght be couted iuste and a iustifiar of him which belevith on Iesus.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.27'>
Where is then thy reioysinge? It is excluded. By what lawe? by ye lawe of workes? Naye: but by the lawe of fayth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.28'>
For we suppose that a man is iustified by fayth without the dedes of ye lawe.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.29'>
Is he the God of the Iewes only? Is he not also the God of the Gentyls? Yes eve of the Gentyles also.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.30'>
For it is God only which iustifieth circumcision which is of fayth and vncircumcision thorow fayth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.3.31'>
Do we then destroye the lawe thorow fayth? God forbid. But we rather mayntayne the lawe.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.1'>
What shall we saye then that Abraham oure father as pertayninge to ye flesshe dyd finde?
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.2'>
If Abraham were iustified by dedes the hath he wherin to reioyce: but not with god.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.3'>
For what sayth the scripture? Abraham beleved god and it was counted vnto him for rightewesnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.4'>
To him that worketh is the rewarde not reckened of favour: but of duty.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.5'>
To him that worketh not but beleveth on him that iustifieth the vngodly is his fayth counted for rightewesnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.6'>
Even as David describeth the blessedfulnes of the man vnto whom god ascribeth rihgtewesnes without dedes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.7'>
Blessed are they whose vnrightewesnes are forgeven and whose synnes are covered.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.8'>
Blessed is that ma to whom the Lorde imputeth not synne.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.9'>
Came this blessednes then vpon the circumcised or vpon the vncircucised? We saye verely how that fayth was rekened to Abraham for rightewesnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.10'>
How was it rekened? in the tyme of circumcision? or in the tyme before he was circumcised? Not in tyme of circucision: but when he was yet vncircumcised.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.11'>
And he receaved the signe of circumcision as a seale of yt rightewesnes which is by fayth which fayth he had yet beynge vncircucised: that he shuld be the father of all them that beleve though they be not circumcised that rightewesnes myght be imputed to them also:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.12'>
and that he myght be the father of the circumcised not because they are circumcised only: but because they walke also in the steppes of that fayth yt was in oure father Abraham before the tyme of circumcision.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.13'>
For the promes that he shuld be the heyre of the worlde was not geven to Abraha or to his seed thorow the lawe: but thorow ye rightewesnes which cometh of fayth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.14'>
For yf they which are of the lawe be heyres then is fayth but vayne and the promes of none effecte.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.15'>
Because the lawe causeth wrathe. For where no lawe is there is no trasgression.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.16'>
Therfore by fayth is the inheritauce geven that it myght come of faveour: and the promes myght be sure to all the seed. Not to them only which are of the lawe: but also to them which are of the fayth of Abraham which is the father of vs all.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.17'>
As it is wrytten: I have made the a father to many nacions even before god whom thou hast beleved which quyckeneth the deed and called those thinges which be not as though they were.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.18'>
Which Abraham contrary to hope beleved in hope that he shuld be the father of many nacions accordynge to that which was spoken:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.19'>
So shall thy seed be. And he faynted not in the fayth nor yet consydered hys awne body which was now deed even when he was almost an hondred yeare olde: nether yet that Sara was past chyldeberinge.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.20'>
He stackered not at the promes of God thorow vnbelefe: but was made stronge in the fayth and gave honour to God
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.21'>
full certifyed that what he had promised that he was able to make good.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.22'>
And therfore was it reckened to him for rightewesnes.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.23'>
It is not written for him only that it was reckened to him for rightewesnes:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.24'>
but also for vs to whom it shalbe counted for rightewesnes so we beleve on him that raysed vp Iesus oure Lorde from deeth.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.4.25'>
Which was delivered for oure synnes and rose agayne forto iustifie vs.
</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rom.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.1'>
Because therfore that we are iustified by fayth we are at peace with god thorow oure Lorde Iesue Christ:
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.2'>
by who we have awaye in thorow fayth vnto this grace wherin we stonde aud reioyce in hope of the prayse that shalbe geven of God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.3'>
Nether do we so only: but also we reioyce in tribulacion. For we know that tribulacion bringeth pacience
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.4'>
pacience bringeth experience experience bringeth hope.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.5'>
And hope maketh not ashamed for the love of God is sheed abrod in oure hertes by the holy goost which is geven vnto vs.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.6'>

Yet scace will eny man dye for a rightewes man. Paraventure for a good ma durst a man dye.

Moche more then now (seynge we are iustifyed in his bloud) shall we be saved from wrath thorow him.

Not only so but we also ioye in God by the meanes of oure Lorde Iesus Christ by whom we have receavyd the attonment.

For even vnto the tyme of the lawe was synne in the worlde: but synne was not regarded as longe as ther was no lawe:

But the gyfte is not lyke as the synne. For yf thorow the synne of one many be deed: moche more plenteous vpon many was the grace of God and gyfte by grace: which grace was geven by one man Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.16'>
And ye gifte is not over one synne as deeth cam thorow one synne of one yt synned. For damnacion cam of one synne vnto condemnacion: but the gyft cam to iustify fro many synnes.

For yf by the synne of one deeth raigned by the meanes of one moche more shall they which receave aboundance of grace and of the gyfte of rightewesnes raygne in lyfe by the meanes of one (that is to saye) Iesus Christ.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.5.18'>
Lykewyse then as by the synne of one condemnacion cam on all men: eve so by the iustifyinge of one cometh the rightewesnes that bringeth lyfe vpo all men.
</verse>

For as by one manes disobediece many be cam synners: so by ye obediece of one shall many be made righteous.

But ye lawe in the meane tyme entred in yt synne shuld encreace. Neverthelater where aboundaunce of synne was there was more plenteousnes of grace.

Remember ye not brethren (I speake to them yt know the lawe) how that the lawe hath power over a man as longe as it endureth?
</verse>

For the woman which is in subieccion to a man is bounde by the lawe to the man as longe as he liveth. Yf the man be deed she is lowsed from the lawe of the man.

So then yf whill the man liveth she couple her selfe with another man she shalbe counted a wedlocke breaker. But yf the man be deed she is fre fro the lawe: so that she is no wedlocke breaker though she couple her selfe with another man.

Even so ye my brethren are deed concerninge the lawe by the body of Christ yt ye shuld be coupled to another (I meane to him that is rysen agayne fro deeth) that we shuld bringe forth frute vnto God.
</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rom.7.5'>
For when we were in the flesshe the lustes of synne which were stered vppe by ye lawe raygned in oure membres to bringe forth frute vnto deeth.

        <verse osisID='Rom.7.6'>
But now are we delivered fro the lawe and deed fro that whervnto we werein bondage that we shuld serve in a newe conversacion of ye sprete and not in ye olde conversacion of the letter.

What shall we saye then? is ye lawe synne? God forbid: but I knewe not what synne meant but by the lawe. For I had not knowne what lust had meant excepte the lawe had sayde thou shalt not lust.

But synne toke an occasion by the meanes of the commaundement and wrought in me all manner of concupiscece. For with out the lawe synne was deed.

I once lived with out lawe. But when the commaundement came synne revyved and I was deed.

And the very same comaundement which was ordeyned vnto lyfe was founde to be vnto me an occasion of deeth.

For synne toke occasion by the meanes of the comaundement and so disceaved me and by the selfe commaundement slewe we.

For we knowe that the lawe is spirituall: but I am carnall solde vnder synne

For what the lawe coulde not doo in as moche it was weake because of the flesshe: that performed God and sent his sonne in the similitude of synfull flesshe and by synne daned synne in ye flesshe:

that the rightewesnes requyred of the lawe myght be fulfilled in vs which walke not after the flesshe but after the sprete.

For they that are carnall are carnally mynded. But they that are spirituall are gostly mynded.

To be carnally mynded is deeth. But to be spiritually mynded is lyfe and peace.

Because that the flesshly mynde is emnyte agaynst God: for it is not obedient to the lawe of God nether can be.

But ye are not geven to the flesshe but to the sprete: yf so be that ye sprite of God dwell in you. If ther be eny man yt hath not ye sprite of Christ ye same is none of his.

Yf Christ be in you the body is deed because of synne: but the sprite is lyfe for rightewesnes sake.

Therfore brethren we are nowe detters not to the flesshe to live after the flesshe.

For as many as are led by the sprete of God: they are the sonnes of god.
