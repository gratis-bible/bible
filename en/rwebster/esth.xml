      <chapter osisID='Esth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is Ahasuerus who reigned, from India even to Cush, over an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.2'>That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.3'>In the third year of his reign, he made a feast to all his princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.4'>When he showed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and eighty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.5'>And when these days had ended, the king made a feast for all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both for great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden of the king’s palace; <note>present: Heb. found</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.6'>Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of marble: the couches were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of red, and blue, and white, and black, marble. <note>blue, hangings: or, violet, etc</note><note>of red…: or, of porphyre, and marble and alabaster, and stone of blue colour</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.7'>And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels differing one from another,) and royal wine in abundance, according to the bounty of the king. <note>royal…: Heb. wine of the kingdom</note><note>state: Heb. hand</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.8'>And the drinking was according to the law; none constrained: for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his house, that they should do according to every man’s pleasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.9'>Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.10'>On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king, <note>chamberlains: or, eunuchs</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.11'>To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown royal, to show the people and the princes her beauty: for she was fair to look on. <note>fair…: Heb. good of countenance</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.12'>But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king’s commandment by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very angry, and his anger burned in him. <note>by his…: Heb. which was by the hand of his eunuchs</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.13'>Then the king said to the wise men, who knew the times, (for so was the king’s manner toward all that knew law and judgment:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.14'>And the next to him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of Persia and Media, who saw the king’s face, and who sat in the first place in the kingdom;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.15'>What shall we do to the queen Vashti according to law, because she hath not performed the commandment of the king Ahasuerus by the chamberlains? <note>What…: Heb. What to do</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.16'>And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.17'>For this deed of the queen shall become known to all women, so that they shall look with contempt upon their husbands, when it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.18'>Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day to all the king’s princes, who have heard of the deed of the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.19'>If it pleaseth the king, let a royal commandment go from him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate to another that is better than she. <note>If it…: Heb. If it be good with the king</note><note>from him: Heb. from before him</note><note>be not…: Heb. pass not away</note><note>unto…: Heb. unto her companion</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.20'>And when the king’s decree which he shall make shall be proclaimed throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great and small.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.21'>And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king did according to the word of Memucan: <note>pleased…: Heb. was good in the eyes of the king</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.1.22'>For he sent letters into all the king’s provinces, into every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language, that every man should bear rule in his own house, and that it should be proclaimed in the language of every people. <note>that it…: Heb. that one should publish it according to the language of his people</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.1'>After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and what was decreed against her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.2'>Then said the king’s servants that ministered to him, Let there be fair young virgins sought for the king:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.3'>And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his kingdom, that they may gather all the fair young virgins to Shushan the palace, to the house of the women, into the custody of Hege the king’s chamberlain, keeper of the women; and let their things for purification be given them: <note>unto the…: Heb. unto the hand</note><note>Hege: also called, Hegai</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.4'>And let the maiden who pleaseth the king be queen instead of Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.5'>Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, a Benjamite;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.6'>Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captives who had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away. <note>Jeconiah: also called, Jehoiachin</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.7'>And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle’s daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and mother were dead, took for his own daughter. <note>brought…: Heb. nourished</note><note>fair…: Heb. fair of form, and good of countenance</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.8'>So it came to pass, when the king’s commandment and his decree were heard, and when many maidens were gathered at Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was brought also to the king’s house, to the custody of Hegai, keeper of the women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.9'>And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness from him; and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with such things as belonged to her, and seven choice maidens, to be given her, out of the king’s house: and he preferred her and her maids to the best place of the house of the women. <note>such…: Heb. her portions</note><note>preferred: Heb. changed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.10'>Esther had not revealed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai had charged her that she should not make it known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.11'>And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women’s house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her. <note>to know…: Heb. to know the peace</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.12'>Now when every maid’s turn had come to go in to king Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to the law for the women, (for so were the days of their purifications accomplished, that is, six months with oil of myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things for the purifying of the women;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.13'>Then thus came every maiden to the king; whatever she desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the women to the king’s house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.14'>In the evening she went, and on the next morning she returned into the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz, the king’s chamberlain, who kept the concubines: she came in to the king no more, except that the king delighted in her, and she was called by name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.15'>Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, had come to go in to the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the king’s chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.16'>So Esther was taken to king Ahasuerus into his house royal in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh year of his reign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.17'>And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and made her queen instead of Vashti. <note>favour: or, kindness</note><note>in his…: Heb. before him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.18'>Then the king made a great feast to all his princes and his servants, even Esther’s feast; and he made a release to the provinces, and gave gifts, according to the bounty of the king. <note>release: Heb. rest</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.19'>And when the virgins were gathered together the second time, then Mordecai sat in the king’s gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.20'>Esther had not yet revealed her kindred nor her people; as Mordecai had charged her: for Esther performed the commandment of Mordecai, as when she was brought up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.21'>In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king’s gate, two of the king’s chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those who kept the door, were angry, and sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. <note>Bigthan: also called, Bigthana</note><note>the door: Heb. the threshold</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.22'>And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it to Esther the queen; and Esther informed the king of it in Mordecai’s name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.2.23'>And when enquiry was made of the matter, it was discovered; therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written in the book of the chronicles before the king.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.1'>After these things king Ahasuerus promoted Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat above all the princes that were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.2'>And all the king’s servants, that were in the king’s gate, bowed, and paid honour to Haman: for the king had so commanded concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did pay him honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.3'>Then the king’s servants, who were in the king’s gate, said to Mordecai, Why dost thou transgress the king’s commandment?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.4'>Now it came to pass, when they spoke daily to him, and he hearkened not to them, that they told Haman, to see whether Mordecai’s reason would stand: for he had told them that he was a Jew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.5'>And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did pay him honour, then was Haman full of wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.6'>And he disdained to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they had made known to him the people of Mordecai: therefore Haman sought to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.7'>In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot, before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.8'>And Haman said to king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are different from all people; neither keep they the king’s laws: therefore it is not for the king’s profit to allow them to remain. <note>for the…: Heb. meet or, equal, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.9'>If it shall please the king, let it be written that they may be destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to bring it into the king’s treasuries. <note>that they…: Heb. to destroy them</note><note>pay: Heb. weigh</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.10'>And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it to Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews’ enemy. <note>enemy: or, oppressor</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.11'>And the king said to Haman, The silver is given to thee, the people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.12'>Then were the king’s scribes called on the thirteenth day of the first month, and there was written according to all that Haman had commanded to the king’s satraps, and to the governors that were over every province, and to the princes of every people of every province according to the writing of it, and to every people after their language; in the name of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king’s ring. <note>scribes: or, secretaries</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.13'>And the letters were sent by posts into all the king’s provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, and to plunder them for spoil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.14'>The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every province was proclaimed to all people, that they should be ready for that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.3.15'>The posts departed, being hastened by the king’s commandment, and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was perplexed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.1'>When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai tore his clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.2'>And came even before the king’s gate: for none might enter into the king’s gate clothed with sackcloth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.3'>And in every province, wherever the king’s commandment and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews, and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in sackcloth and ashes. <note>many…: Heb. sackcloth and ashes were laid under many</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.4'>So Esther’s maids and her chamberlains came and told it to her. Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him: but he accepted it not. <note>chamberlains: Heb. eunuchs</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.5'>Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king’s chamberlains, whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a commandment to Mordecai, to learn what it was, and why it was. <note>appointed…: Heb. set before her</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.6'>So Hatach went forth to Mordecai to the street of the city, which was before the king’s gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.7'>And Mordecai told him all that had happened to him, and of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the king’s treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.8'>Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that was given at Shushan to destroy them, to show it to Esther, and to tell it to her, and to charge her that she should go in to the king, to make supplication to him, and to make request before him for her people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.9'>And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.10'>Again Esther spoke to Hatach, and gave him commandment to Mordecai;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.11'>All the king’s servants, and the people of the king’s provinces, do know, that whoever, whether man or woman, shall come to the king into the inner court, who is not called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except him to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that he may live: but I have not been called to come in to the king these thirty days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.12'>And they told to Mordecai Esther’s words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.13'>Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with thyself that thou shalt escape in the king’s house, more than all the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.14'>For if thou shalt altogether hold thy peace at this time, then shall there relief and deliverance arise to the Jews from another place; but thou and thy father’s house shall be destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou hast come to the kingdom for such a time as this? <note>enlargement: Heb. respiration</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.15'>Then Esther told them return Mordecai this answer,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.16'>Go, gather all the Jews that are present in Shushan, and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days, night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so will I go in to the king, which is not according to the law: and if I perish, I perish. <note>present: Heb. found</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.4.17'>So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther had commanded him. <note>went…: Heb. passed</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.5'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.1'>Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king’s house, opposite the king’s house: and the king sat upon his royal throne in the royal house, opposite the entrance of the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.2'>And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.3'>Then said the king to her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.4'>And Esther answered, If it shall seem good to the king, let the king and Haman come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.5'>Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet that Esther had prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.6'>And the king said to Esther at the banquet of wine, What is thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be performed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.7'>Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.8'>If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it shall please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king hath said. <note>perform: Heb. do</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.9'>Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart: but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king’s gate, that he stood not up, nor trembled before him, he was full of indignation against Mordecai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.10'>Nevertheless Haman restrained himself: and when he came home, he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife. <note>called…: Heb. caused to come</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.11'>And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the multitude of his children, and all the things in which the king had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the princes and servants of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.12'>Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen let no man come in with the king to the banquet that she had prepared but myself; and to morrow I am invited to her also with the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.13'>Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king’s gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.5.14'>Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends to him, Let a gallows be made fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou to the king that Mordecai may be hanged on it: then go thou in merrily with the king to the banquet. And the thing pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made. <note>gallows: Heb. tree</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Esth.6'>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.1'>In that night the king could not sleep, and he commanded to bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were read before the king. <note>could…: Heb. the king’s sleep fled away</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Esth.6.2'>And it was found written, that Mordecai had informed on Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king’s chamberlains, the keepers of the door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus. <note>Bigthana: also called, Bigthan</note><note>door: Heb. threshold</note></verse>
