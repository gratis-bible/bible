  <div type='book' osisID='1Cor'>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.1'>Paul, called to be an apostle of Jesus Christ through the will of God, and Sosthenes our brother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.2'>To the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.3'>Grace be to you, and peace, from God our Father, and from the Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.4'>I thank my God always on your behalf, for the grace of God which is given you by Jesus Christ;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.5'>That in every thing ye are enriched by him, in all utterance, and in all knowledge;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.6'>Even as the testimony of Christ was confirmed in you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.7'>So that ye come behind in no gift; waiting for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ: <note>coming: Gr. revelation</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.8'>Who shall also confirm you to the end, that ye may be blameless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.9'>God is faithful, by whom ye were called to the fellowship of his Son Jesus Christ our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.10'>Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment. <note>divisions: Gr. schisms</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.11'>For it hath been declared to me concerning you, my brethren, by them who are of the house of Chloe, that there are contentions among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.12'>Now this I say, that each one of you saith, I am of Paul; and I of Apollos; and I of Cephas; and I of Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.13'>Is Christ divided? was Paul crucified for you? or were ye baptized in the name of Paul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.14'>I thank God that I baptized none of you, but Crispus and Gaius;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.15'>Lest any should say that I had baptized in my own name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.16'>And I baptized also the household of Stephanas: besides, I know not whether I baptized any other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.17'>For Christ hath not sent me to baptize, but to preach the gospel: not with wisdom of words, lest the cross of Christ should be made of no effect. <note>words: or, speech</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.18'>For the preaching of the cross is to them that perish foolishness; but to us who are saved it is the power of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.19'>For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will bring to nothing the understanding of the prudent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.20'>Where is the wise? where is the scribe? where is the disputer of this world? hath not God made foolish the wisdom of this world?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.21'>For when in the wisdom of God the world by wisdom knew not God, it pleased God by the foolishness of preaching to save them that believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.22'>For the Jews require a sign, and the Greeks seek wisdom:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.23'>But we preach Christ crucified, to the Jews a stumblingblock, and to the Greeks foolishness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.24'>But to them who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.25'>Because the foolishness of God is wiser than men; and the weakness of God is stronger than men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.26'>For ye see your calling, brethren, that not many wise men after the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble, are called:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.27'>But God hath chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise; and God hath chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.28'>And base things of the world, and things which are despised, hath God chosen, and things which are not, to bring to nought things that are:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.29'>That no flesh should glory in his presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.30'>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who from God is made to us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.1.31'>That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.1'>And I, brethren, when I came to you, came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom, declaring to you the testimony of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.2'>For I determined not to know any thing among you, except Jesus Christ, and him crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.3'>And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.4'>And my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: <note>enticing: or, persuasible</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.5'>That your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God. <note>stand: Gr. be</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.6'>However we speak wisdom among them that are perfect: yet not the wisdom of this world, nor of the princes of this world, that come to nought:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.7'>But we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery, even the hidden wisdom, which God ordained before the world to our glory:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.8'>Which none of the princes of this world knew: for had they known it, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.9'>But as it is written, Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.10'>But God hath revealed them to us by his Spirit: for the Spirit searcheth all things, even, the deep things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.11'>For what man knoweth the things of a man, except the spirit of man which is in him? even so the things of God knoweth no man, but the Spirit of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.12'>Now we have received, not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God; that we may know the things that are freely given to us by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.13'>Which things also we speak, not in the words which man’s wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Spirit teacheth; comparing spiritual things with spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.14'>But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness to him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.15'>But he that is spiritual judgeth all things, yet he himself is judged by no man. <note>judgeth: or, discerneth</note><note>judged: or, discerned</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.2.16'>For who hath known the mind of the Lord, that he may instruct him? But we have the mind of Christ. <note>may: Gr. shall</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.1'>And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual, but as to carnal, even as to babes in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.2'>I have fed you with milk, and not with meat: for until now ye were not able to bear it, neither yet now are ye able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.3'>For ye are yet carnal: for though there is among you envying, and strife, and divisions, are ye not carnal, and walk as men? <note>divisions: or, factions</note><note>as men: Gr. according to man?</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.4'>For while one saith, I am of Paul; and another, I am of Apollos; are ye not carnal?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.5'>Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom ye believed, even as the Lord gave to every man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.6'>I have planted, Apollos watered; but God hath given the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.7'>So then neither is he that planteth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God that giveth the increase.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.8'>Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.9'>For we are labourers together with God: ye are God’s field, ye are God’s building. <note>husbandry: or, tillage</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.10'>According to the grace of God which is given to me, as a wise masterbuilder, I have laid the foundation, and another buildeth upon it. But let every man take heed how he buildeth upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.11'>For other foundation can no man lay than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.12'>Now if any man buildeth upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.13'>Every man’s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man’s work of what sort it is. <note>it shall be: Gr. it is</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.14'>If any man’s work abideth which he hath built upon it, he shall receive a reward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.15'>If any man’s work shall be burned, he shall suffer loss: but he himself shall be saved; yet so as by fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.16'>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.17'>If any man defileth the temple of God, him shall God destroy; for the temple of God is holy, which temple ye are. <note>defile: or, destroy</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.18'>Let no man deceive himself. If any man among you seemeth to be wise in this world, let him become a fool, that he may be wise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.19'>For the wisdom of this world is foolishness with God. For it is written, He taketh the wise in their own craftiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.20'>And again, The Lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise, that they are vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.21'>Therefore let no man glory in men. For all things are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.22'>Whether Paul, or Apollos, or Cephas, or the world, or life, or death, or things present, or things to come; all are yours;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.3.23'>And ye are Christ’s; and Christ is God’s.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.1'>Let a man so account of us, as of the ministers of Christ, and stewards of the mysteries of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.2'>Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.3'>But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you, or by man’s judgment: yea, I judge not my own self. <note>judgment: Gr. day</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.4'>For I know nothing against myself; yet am I not hereby justified: but he that judgeth me is the Lord. <note>know: or, I am not conscious of any fault</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.5'>Therefore judge nothing before the time, until the Lord shall come, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness, and will reveal the counsels of the hearts: and then shall every man have praise from God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.6'>And these things, brethren, I have in a figure transferred to myself and to Apollos for your sakes; that ye may learn in us not to think of men above that which is written, that no one of you on account of one may be puffed up against another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.7'>For who maketh thee to differ from another? and what hast thou that thou didst not receive? now if thou didst receive it, why dost thou glory, as if thou hadst not received it? <note>maketh…: Gr. distinguisheth thee</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.8'>Now ye are full, now ye are rich, ye have reigned as kings without us: and I wish ye did reign, that we also might reign with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.9'>For I think that God hath set forth us the apostles last, as it were appointed to death: for we are made a spectacle to the world, and to angels, and to men. <note>us…: or, us the last apostles, as</note><note>spectacle: Gr. theatre</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.10'>We are fools for Christ’s sake, but ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye are strong; ye are honourable, but we are despised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.11'>Even to this present hour we both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and are buffeted, and have no certain dwellingplace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.12'>And labour, working with our own hands: being reviled, we bless; being persecuted, we endure it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.13'>Being defamed, we entreat: we are made as the filth of the world, the offscouring of all things to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.14'>I write not these things to shame you, but as my beloved sons I warn you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.15'>For though ye have ten thousand instructors in Christ, yet have ye not many fathers: for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.16'>Therefore I beseech you, be ye followers of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.17'>For this cause have I sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved son, and faithful in the Lord, who shall bring you into remembrance of my ways which are in Christ, as I teach every where in every church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.18'>Now some are puffed up, as though I would not come to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.19'>But I will come to you shortly, if the Lord will, and will know, not the speech of them who are puffed up, but the power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.20'>For the kingdom of God is not in word, but in power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.4.21'>What will ye? shall I come to you with a rod, or in love, and in the spirit of meekness?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.1'>It is reported commonly that there is immorality among you, and such immorality as is not so much as named among the Gentiles, that one should have his father’s wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.2'>And ye are puffed up, and have not rather mourned, that he who hath done this deed might be taken away from among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.3'>For I verily, as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as though I were present, concerning him that hath so done this deed, <note>judged: or, determined</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.4'>In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, when ye are gathered together, and my spirit, with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.5'>To deliver such one to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.6'>Your boasting is not good. Know ye not that a little leaven leaveneth the whole lump?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.7'>Therefore purge out the old leaven, that ye may be a new lump, as ye are unleavened. For even Christ our passover is sacrificed for us: <note>is sacrificed: or, is slain</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.8'>Therefore let us keep the feast, not with old leaven, neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth. <note>the feast: or, holyday</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.9'>I wrote to you in my epistle not to associate with immoral people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.10'>Yet not altogether with immoral people of this world, or with the covetous, or extortioners, or with idolaters; for then ye must needs go out of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.11'>But now I have written to you not to keep company, if any man that is called a brother is an immoral person, or covetous, or an idolater, or a railer, or a drunkard, or an extortioner; with such a person no not to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.12'>For what have I to do to judge them also that are outside the church? do ye not judge them that are within?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.5.13'>But them that are outside God judgeth. Therefore put away from among yourselves that wicked person.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.6'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.1'>Dare any of you, having a matter against another, go to law before the unjust, and not before the saints?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.2'>Do ye not know that the saints shall judge the world? and if the world shall be judged by you, are ye unworthy to judge the smallest matters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.3'>Know ye not that we shall judge angels? how much more things that pertain to this life?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.4'>If then ye have judgments of things pertaining to this life, set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.5'>I speak to your shame. Is it so, that there is not a wise man among you? no, not one that shall be able to judge between his brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.6'>But brother goeth to law with brother, and that before unbelievers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.7'>Now therefore there is utterly a fault among you, because ye go to law one with another. Why do ye not rather take wrong? why do ye not rather allow yourselves to be defrauded?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.8'>But, ye do wrong, and defraud, and that your brethren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.9'>Know ye not that the unrighteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abusers of themselves with mankind,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.10'>Nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.11'>And such were some of you: but ye are washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and by the Spirit of our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.12'>All things are lawful to me, but all things are not expedient: all things are lawful for me, but I will not be brought under the power of any. <note>expedient: or, profitable</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.13'>Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food: but God shall destroy both it and them. Now the body is not for immorality, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. <note>Meats: not flesh only, but food of any kind</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.14'>And God hath both raised up the Lord, and will also raise up us by his own power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.15'>Know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ? shall I then take the members of Christ, and make them the members of an harlot? By no means.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.16'>What? know ye not that he who is joined to an harlot is one body? for two, saith he, shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.17'>But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.18'>Flee immorality. Every sin that a man doeth is outside the body; but he that committeth immorality sinneth against his own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.19'>What? know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, which ye have from God, and ye are not your own?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.6.20'>For ye are bought with a price: therefore glorify God in your body, and in your spirit, which are God’s.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.7'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.1'>Now concerning the things of which ye wrote to me: It is good for a man not to touch a woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.2'>Nevertheless, to avoid immorality, let every man have his own wife, and let every woman have her own husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.7.3'>Let the husband render to the wife her due benevolence: and likewise also the wife to the husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.2'>Ye know that ye were Gentiles, carried away to these dumb idols, even as ye were led.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.3'>Therefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Spirit. <note>accursed: or, anathema</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.4'>Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.5'>And there are varieties of administrations, but the same Lord. <note>administrations: or, ministries</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.6'>And there are varieties of operations, but it is the same God who worketh all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.7'>But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man for profit of all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.8'>For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom; to another the word of knowledge by the same Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.9'>To another faith by the same Spirit; to another the gifts of healing by the same Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.10'>To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another discerning of spirits; to another various kinds of tongues; to another the interpretation of tongues:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.11'>But all these worketh that one and the very same Spirit, dividing to every man individually as he will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.12'>For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.13'>For by one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Gentiles, whether bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit. <note>Gentiles: Gr. Greeks</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.14'>For the body is not one member, but many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.15'>If the foot shall say, Because I am not the hand, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.16'>And if the ear shall say, Because I am not the eye, I am not of the body; is it therefore not of the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.17'>If the whole body were an eye, where were the hearing? If the whole were hearing, where were the smelling?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.18'>But now hath God set the members every one of them in the body, as it hath pleased him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.19'>And if they were all one member, where were the body?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.20'>But now are they many members, yet but one body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.21'>And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of thee: nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.22'>Nay, much more those members of the body, which seem to be more feeble, are necessary:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.23'>And those members of the body, which we think to be less honourable, upon these we bestow more abundant honour; and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness. <note>bestow: or, put on</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.24'>For our comely parts have no need: but God hath tempered the body together, having given more abundant honour to that part which lacked:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.25'>That there should be no schism in the body; but that the members should have the same care one for another. <note>schism: or, division</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.26'>And if one member suffer, all the members suffer with it; or if one member is honoured, all the members rejoice with it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.27'>Now ye are the body of Christ, and members in particular.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.28'>And God hath set some in the church, first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healings, helps, governments, various kinds of tongues. <note>diversities: or, kinds</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.29'>Are all apostles? are all prophets? are all teachers? are all workers of miracles? <note>workers…: or, powers?</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.30'>Have all the gifts of healing? do all speak with tongues? do all interpret?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.12.31'>But covet earnestly the best gifts: and yet I show to you a more excellent way.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.13'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.1'>Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.2'>And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries, and all knowledge; and though I have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.3'>And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.4'>Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, <note>vaunteth…: or, is not rash</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.5'>Doth not behave itself unseemly, seeketh not its own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no evil;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.6'>Rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; <note>in the truth: or, with the truth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.7'>Beareth all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.8'>Charity never faileth: but whether there are prophecies, they shall be done away; whether there are tongues, they shall cease; whether there is knowledge, it shall vanish away. <note>fail: Gr. vanish away</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.9'>For we know in part, and we prophesy in part.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.10'>But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away. <note>done away: Gr. vanish away</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.11'>When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things. <note>thought: or, reasoned</note><note>put away: Gr. vanish away</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.12'>For now we see in a mirror, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known. <note>darkly: Gr. in a riddle</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.13.13'>And now abideth faith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is charity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.14'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.1'>Follow after charity, and desire spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.2'>For he that speaketh in an unknown tongue speaketh not to men, but to God: for no man understandeth him; yet in the spirit he speaketh mysteries. <note>understandeth: Gr. heareth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.3'>But he that prophesieth speaketh to men to edification, and exhortation, and comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.4'>He that speaketh in an unknown tongue edifieth himself; but he that prophesieth edifieth the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.5'>I would that ye all spoke with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied: for greater is he that prophesieth than he that speaketh with tongues, except he interpret, that the church may receive edifying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.6'>Now, brethren, if I come to you speaking with tongues, what shall I profit you, except I shall speak to you either by revelation, or by knowledge, or by prophesying, or by doctrine?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.7'>And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp, except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known what is piped or harped? <note>sounds: or, tunes</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.8'>For if the trumpet shall give an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for battle?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.9'>So likewise ye, except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how shall it be known what is spoken? for ye shall speak into the air. <note>easy…: Gr. significant</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.10'>There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and none of them is without signification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.11'>Therefore if I know not the meaning of the voice, I shall be to him that speaketh a barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.12'>Even so ye, forasmuch as ye are zealous of spiritual gifts, seek that ye may excel to the edifying of the church. <note>of spiritual gifts: Gr. of spirits</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.13'>Therefore let him that speaketh in an unknown tongue pray that he may interpret.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.14'>For if I pray in an unknown tongue, my spirit prayeth, but my understanding is unfruitful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.15'>What is it then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing with the understanding also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.16'>Else when thou shalt bless with the spirit, how shall he that occupieth the place of the unlearned say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth not what thou sayest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.17'>For thou verily givest thanks well, but the other is not edified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.18'>I thank my God, I speak with tongues more than ye all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.19'>Yet in the church I had rather speak five words with my understanding, that by my voice I may teach others also, than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.20'>Brethren, be not children in understanding: yet in malice be ye children, but in understanding be men. <note>men: Gr. perfect, or, of a ripe age</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.21'>In the law it is written, With men of other tongues and other lips will I speak to this people; and yet for all that will they not hear me, saith the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.22'>Therefore tongues are for a sign, not to them that believe, but to them that believe not: but prophesying serveth not for them that believe not, but for them who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.23'>If therefore the whole church is assembled in one place, and all speak with tongues, and there come in those that are unlearned, or unbelievers, will they not say that ye are mad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.24'>But if all prophesy, and there come in one that believeth not, or one unlearned, he is convicted by all, he is judged by all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.25'>And thus are the secrets of his heart made known; and so falling down on his face he will worship God, and report that God is in you in truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.26'>How is it then, brethren? when ye are assembled, each one of you hath a psalm, hath a doctrine, hath a tongue, hath a revelation, hath an interpretation. Let all things be done for edification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.27'>If any man speaketh in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course; and let one interpret. <note>two…: by two or three sentences separately</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.28'>But if there is no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak to himself, and to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.29'>Let the prophets speak two or three, and let the others judge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.30'>If any thing is revealed to another that sitteth by, let the first hold his peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.31'>For ye may all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.32'>And the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.33'>For God is not the author of confusion, but of peace, as in all churches of the saints. <note>confusion: Gr. tumult, or, unquietness</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.34'>Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted to them to speak; but they are commanded to be under obedience, as also saith the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.35'>And if they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home: for it is a shame for women to speak in the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.36'>What? came the word of God out from you? or came it to you only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.37'>If any man thinketh himself to be a prophet, or spiritual, let him acknowledge that the things that I write to you are the commandments of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.38'>But if any man is ignorant, let him be ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.39'>Therefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.14.40'>Let all things be done decently and in order.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Cor.15'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.1'>Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also ye have received, and in which ye stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.2'>By which also ye are saved, if ye keep in memory what I preached to you, unless ye have believed in vain. <note>keep…: or, hold fast</note><note>what: Gr. by what speech</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.3'>For I delivered to you first of all that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures;</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.4'>And that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.5'>And that he was seen by Cephas, then by the twelve:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.6'>After that, he was seen by more than five hundred brethren at once; of whom the greater part remain to this present, but some have fallen asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.7'>After that, he was seen by James; then by all the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.8'>And last of all he was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time. <note>one…: or, an abortive</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.9'>For I am the least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.10'>But by the grace of God I am what I am: and his grace which was bestowed upon me was not in vain; but I laboured more abundantly than they all: yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.11'>Therefore whether it was I or they, so we preach, and so ye believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.12'>Now if Christ is preached that he rose from the dead, how say some among you that there is no resurrection of the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.13'>But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.14'>And if Christ is not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.15'>And indeed, we are found false witnesses of God; because we have testified concerning God that he raised up Christ: whom he raised not, if in fact the dead rise not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.16'>For if the dead rise not, then is not Christ raised:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.17'>And if Christ is not raised, your faith is vain; ye are yet in your sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.18'>Then they also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.19'>If in this life only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most miserable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.20'>But now is Christ risen from the dead, and become the firstfruits of them that slept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.21'>For since by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.22'>For as in Adam all die, even so in Christ shall all be made alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.23'>But every man in his own order: Christ the firstfruits; afterward they that are Christ’s at his coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.24'>Then cometh the end, when he shall have delivered up the kingdom to God, even the Father; when he shall have put down all rule and all authority and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.25'>For he must reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.26'>The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.27'>For he hath put all things under his feet. But when he saith all things are put under him, it is evident that he is excepted, who did put all things under him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.28'>And when all things shall be subdued to him, then shall the Son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him, that God may be all in all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.29'>Else what shall they do who are baptized for the dead, if the dead rise not at all? why are they then baptized for the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.30'>And why stand we in jeopardy every hour?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.31'>I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die daily. <note>your: some read, our</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.32'>If after the manner of men I have fought with beasts at Ephesus, what advantage is it to me, if the dead rise not? let us eat and drink; for to morrow we die. <note>after…: or, to speak after the manner of men</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.33'>Be not deceived: evil company corrupteth good habits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.34'>Awake to righteousness, and sin not; for some have not the knowledge of God: I speak this to your shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.35'>But some man will say, How are the dead raised? and with what body do they come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.36'>Thou fool, that which thou sowest is not made alive, except it die:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.37'>And that which thou sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain, perhaps of wheat, or of some other grain:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.38'>But God giveth it a body as it hath pleased him, and to every seed its own body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.39'>All flesh is not the same flesh: but there is one kind of flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another of birds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.40'>There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial is another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.41'>There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars: for one star differeth from another star in glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.42'>So also is the resurrection of the dead. It is sown in corruption; it is raised in incorruption:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.43'>It is sown in dishonour; it is raised in glory: it is sown in weakness; it is raised in power:</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.44'>It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. There is a natural body, and there is a spiritual body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.45'>And so it is written, The first man Adam was made a living soul; the last Adam was made a living spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.46'>However that was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural; and afterward that which is spiritual.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.47'>The first man is from the earth, earthy: the second man is the Lord from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.48'>As is the earthy, such are they also that are earthy: and as is the heavenly, such are they also that are heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.49'>And as we have borne the image of the earthy, we shall also bear the image of the heavenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.50'>Now this I say, brethren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God; neither doth corruption inherit incorruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.51'>Behold, I show you a mystery; We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.52'>In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet: for the trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.53'>For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal must put on immortality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.54'>So when this corruptible shall have put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.55'>O death, where is thy sting? O grave, where is thy victory? <note>grave: or, hell</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.56'>The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.57'>But thanks be to God, who giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.15.58'>Therefore, my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast, unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, forasmuch as ye know that your labour is not in vain in the Lord.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='1Cor.16'>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.1'>Now concerning the collection for the saints, as I have given order to the churches of Galatia, even so do ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.2'>Upon the first day of the week let each one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him, that there be no collections when I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Cor.16.3'>And when I come, whomever ye shall approve by your letters, them will I send to bring your liberality to Jerusalem. <note>liberality: Gr. gift</note></verse>
