        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>She weepeth bitterly in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks: among all her lovers she hath none to comfort her: all her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they are become her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude: she dwelleth among the heathen, she findeth no rest: all her persecutors overtook her in the midst of distress. <note>because of great…: Heb. for the greatness of servitude</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts: all her gates are desolate: her priests sigh, her virgins are afflicted, and she is in bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>Her adversaries are the head, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions: her children are gone into captivity before the enemy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty hath departed: her princes are become like harts that find no pasture, and they are gone without strength before the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none helped her: the adversaries saw her, and mocked at her sabbaths. <note>pleasant: or, desirable</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed: all that honoured her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness: yea, she sigheth, and turneth backward. <note>is…: Heb. is become a removing, or, wandering</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her latter end; therefore she hath been marvellously abased: she had no comforter. O LORD, behold my affliction: for the enemy hath magnified himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things: for she hath seen that the heathen entered into her sanctuary, whom thou didst command that they should not enter into thy congregation. <note>pleasant: or, desirable</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them: he hath spread a net for my feet, he hath turned me back: he hath made me desolate and faint all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand: they are knit together, and come up upon my neck: he hath made my strength to fall, the Lord hath delivered me into their hands, from whom I am not able to rise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>The Lord hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me: he hath called an assembly against me to crush my young men: the Lord hath trodden the virgin, the daughter of Judah, as in a winepress. <note>the virgin…: or, the winepress of the virgin, etc</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>For these things I weep; my eye, my eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me: my children are desolate, because the enemy prevailed. <note>relieve: Heb. bring back</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her: the LORD hath commanded concerning Jacob, that his adversaries should be around him: Jerusalem is as a menstruous woman among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment: hear, I pray you, all people, and behold my sorrow: my virgins and my young men are gone into captivity. <note>commandment: Heb. mouth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>I called for my lovers, but they deceived me: my priests and my elders gave up the ghost in the city, while they sought their food to relieve their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress: my heart is troubled; my heart is turned within me; for I have grievously rebelled: abroad the sword bereaveth, at home there is as death.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>How hath the Lord covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger, and cast down from heaven to the earth the beauty of Israel, and remembered not his footstool in the day of his anger!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>The Lord hath swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and hath not pitied: he hath thrown down in his wrath the strong holds of the daughter of Judah; he hath brought them down to the ground: he hath polluted the kingdom and its princes. <note>brought…: Heb. made to touch</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>He hath cut off in his fierce anger all the horn of Israel: he hath drawn back his right hand from before the enemy, and he burned against Jacob like a flaming fire, which devoureth on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>He hath bent his bow like an enemy: he stood with his right hand as an adversary, and slew all that were pleasant to the eye in the tabernacle of the daughter of Zion: he poured out his fury like fire. <note>all…: Heb. all the desirable of the eye</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>The Lord was as an enemy: he hath swallowed up Israel, he hath swallowed up all her palaces: he hath destroyed his strong holds, and hath increased in the daughter of Judah mourning and lamentation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>And he hath violently taken away his tabernacle, as if it were of a garden: he hath destroyed his places of the assembly: the LORD hath caused the solemn feasts and sabbaths to be forgotten in Zion, and in the indignation of his anger hath despised the king and the priest. <note>tabernacle: or, hedge</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>The Lord hath cast off his altar, he hath abhorred his sanctuary, he hath given up into the hand of the enemy the walls of her palaces; they have made a noise in the house of the LORD, as in the day of a solemn feast. <note>given up: Heb. shut up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>The LORD hath purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion: he hath stretched out a line, he hath not withdrawn his hand from destroying: therefore he made the rampart and the wall to lament; they languished together. <note>destroying: Heb. swallowing up</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Her gates are sunk into the ground; he hath destroyed and broken her bars: her king and her princes are among the Gentiles: the law is no more; her prophets also find no vision from the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground, and keep silence: they have cast up dust upon their heads; they have girded themselves with sackcloth: the virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>My eyes do fail with tears, my heart is troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, for the destruction of the daughter of my people; because the children and the sucklings swoon in the streets of the city. <note>swoon: or, faint</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? when they swooned as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul was poured out into their mothers’ bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>What thing shall I take to witness for thee? what thing shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? what shall I equal to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? for thy breach is great like the sea: who can heal thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>Thy prophets have seen vain and foolish things for thee: and they have not revealed thy iniquity, to turn away thy captivity; but have seen for thee false burdens and causes of banishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>All that pass by clap their hands at thee; they hiss and shake their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, saying, Is this the city that men call The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth? <note>by: Heb. by the way</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>All thy enemies have opened their mouth against thee: they hiss and gnash the teeth: they say, We have swallowed her up: certainly this is the day that we looked for; we have found, we have seen it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>The LORD hath done that which he had devised; he hath fulfilled his word that he had commanded in the days of old: he hath thrown down, and hath not pitied: and he hath caused thy enemy to rejoice over thee, he hath set up the horn of thy adversaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Their heart cried to the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night: give thyself no rest; let not the apple of thy eye cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Arise, cry out in the night: in the beginning of the watches pour out thy heart like water before the face of the Lord: lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young children, that faint for hunger at the head of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>Behold, O LORD, and consider to whom thou hast done this. Shall the women eat their fruit, children of a span long? shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord? <note>of a span…: or, swaddled with their hands?</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>The young and the old lie on the ground in the streets: my virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword; thou hast slain them in the day of thy anger; thou hast killed, and not pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>Thou hast called as in a solemn day my terrors on every side, so that in the day of the LORD’S anger none escaped nor remained: those that I have swaddled and brought up hath my enemy consumed.</verse>
