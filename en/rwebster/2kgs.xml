      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.1'>Then Moab rebelled against Israel after the death of Ahab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.2'>And Ahaziah fell down through a lattice in his upper chamber that was in Samaria, and was sick: and he sent messengers, and said to them, Go, enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron whether I shall recover from this disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.3'>But the angel of the LORD said to Elijah the Tishbite, Arise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of Samaria, and say to them, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that ye go to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.4'>Now therefore thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die. And Elijah departed. <note>Thou shalt…: Heb. The bed whither thou art gone up, thou shalt not come down from it</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.5'>And when the messengers returned to him, he said to them, Why have ye now returned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.6'>And they said to him, There came up a man to meet us, and said to us, Go, return to the king that sent you, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Is it not because there is not a God in Israel, that thou sendest to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron? therefore thou shalt not come down from that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.7'>And he said to them, What manner of man was he who came up to meet you, and told you these words? <note>What…: Heb. What was the manner of the man</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.8'>And they answered him, He was an hairy man, and girt with a leather belt about his loins. And he said, It is Elijah the Tishbite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.9'>Then the king sent to him a captain of fifty with his fifty. And he went up to him: and, behold, he sat on the top of an hill. And he spoke to him, Thou man of God, the king hath said, Come down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.10'>And Elijah answered and said to the captain of fifty, If I am a man of God, then let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And there came down fire from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.11'>Again also he sent to him another captain of fifty with his fifty. And he answered and said to him, O man of God, thus hath the king said, Come down quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.12'>And Elijah answered and said to them, If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven, and consume thee and thy fifty. And the fire of God came down from heaven, and consumed him and his fifty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.13'>And he sent again a captain of the third fifty with his fifty. And the third captain of fifty went up, and came and fell on his knees before Elijah, and besought him, and said to him, O man of God, I pray thee, let my life, and the life of these fifty thy servants, be precious in thy sight. <note>fell: Heb. bowed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.14'>Behold, there came fire down from heaven, and burnt up the two captains of the former fifties with their fifties: therefore let my life now be precious in thy sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.15'>And the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, Go down with him: be not afraid of him. And he arose, and went down with him to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.16'>And he said to him, Thus saith the LORD, Forasmuch as thou hast sent messengers to enquire of Baalzebub the god of Ekron, is it not because there is no God in Israel to enquire of his word? therefore thou shalt not come down off that bed on which thou art gone up, but shalt surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.17'>So he died according to the word of the LORD which Elijah had spoken. And Jehoram reigned in his stead in the second year of Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah; because he had no son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.1.18'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahaziah which he did, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.1'>And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah into heaven by a whirlwind, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.2'>And Elijah said to Elisha, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Bethel. And Elisha said As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they went down to Bethel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.3'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Bethel came forth to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he said, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.4'>And Elijah said to him, Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. So they came to Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.5'>And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came to Elisha, and said to him, Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to day? And he answered, Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.6'>And Elijah said to him, Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jordan. And he said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And they two went on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.7'>And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood to view afar off: and they two stood by Jordan. <note>to view: Heb. in sight, or, over against</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.8'>And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided to the one side and to the other, so that they two went over on dry ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.9'>And it came to pass, when they had gone over, that Elijah said to Elisha, Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken away from thee. And Elisha said, I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.10'>And he said, Thou hast asked a hard thing: nevertheless, if thou shalt see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so to thee; but if not, it shall not be so. <note>Thou hast…: Heb. Thou hast done hard in asking</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.11'>And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and separated them; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.12'>And Elisha saw it, and he cried, My father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen. And he saw him no more: and he took hold of his own clothes, and tore them in two pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.13'>He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of Jordan; <note>bank: Heb. lip</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.14'>And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said, Where is the LORD God of Elijah? and when he also had smitten the waters, they parted to the one side and to the other: and Elisha went over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.15'>And when the sons of the prophets who were looking on at Jericho saw him, they said, The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha. And they came to meet him, and bowed themselves to the ground before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.16'>And they said to him, Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master: lest perhaps the Spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley. And he said, Ye shall not send. <note>strong…: Heb. sons of strength</note><note>some mountain: Heb. one of the mountains</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.17'>And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said, Send. They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.18'>And when they came again to him, (for he tarried at Jericho,) he said to them, Did I not say to you, Go not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.19'>And the men of the city said to Elisha, Behold, I pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth: but the water is bad, and the ground barren. <note>barren: Heb. causing to miscarry</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.20'>And he said, Bring me a new cruse, and put salt in it. And they brought it to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.21'>And he went forth to the spring of the waters, and cast the salt in there, and said, Thus saith the LORD, I have healed these waters; there shall not be from there any more death or barren land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.22'>So the waters were healed to this day, according to the saying of Elisha which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.23'>And he went up from there to Bethel: and as he was going up by the way, there came forth youths out of the city, and mocked him, and said to him, Go up, thou bald head; go up, thou bald head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.24'>And he turned back, and looked on them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two youths of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.2.25'>And he went from there to mount Carmel, and from there he returned to Samaria.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.1'>Now Jehoram the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and reigned twelve years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.2'>And he wrought evil in the sight of the LORD; but not like his father, and like his mother: for he put away the image of Baal that his father had made. <note>image: Heb. statue</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.3'>Nevertheless he cleaved to the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin; he departed not from it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.4'>And Mesha king of Moab was a sheepmaster, and rendered to the king of Israel an hundred thousand lambs, and an hundred thousand rams, with the wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.5'>But it came to pass, when Ahab was dead, that the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.6'>And king Jehoram went out of Samaria the same time, and numbered all Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.7'>And he went and sent to Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, saying, The king of Moab hath rebelled against me: wilt thou go with me against Moab to battle? And he said, I will go: I am as thou art, my people as thy people, and my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.8'>And he said, Which way shall we go up? And he answered, The way through the wilderness of Edom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.9'>So the king of Israel went, and the king of Judah, and the king of Edom: and they made a circuit of seven days’ journey: and there was no water for the army, and for the cattle that followed them. <note>that…: Heb. at their feet</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.10'>And the king of Israel said, Alas! that the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab!</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.11'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD, that we may enquire of the LORD by him? And one of the king of Israel’s servants answered and said, Here is Elisha the son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.12'>And Jehoshaphat said, The word of the LORD is with him. So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat and the king of Edom went down to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.13'>And Elisha said to the king of Israel, What have I to do with thee? go to the prophets of thy father, and to the prophets of thy mother. And the king of Israel said to him, Nay: for the LORD hath called these three kings together, to deliver them into the hand of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.14'>And Elisha said, As the LORD of hosts liveth, before whom I stand, surely, were it not that I regard the presence of Jehoshaphat the king of Judah, I would not look toward thee, nor see thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.15'>But now bring me a minstrel. And it came to pass, when the minstrel played, that the hand of the LORD came upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.16'>And he said, Thus saith the LORD, Make this valley full of ditches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.17'>For thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not see wind, neither shall ye see rain; yet that valley shall be filled with water, that ye may drink, both ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.18'>And this is but a light thing in the sight of the LORD: he will deliver the Moabites also into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.19'>And ye shall smite every fortified city, and every choice city, and shall fell every good tree, and stop all wells of water, and mar every good piece of land with stones. <note>mar: Heb. grieve</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.20'>And it came to pass in the morning, when the meat offering was offered, that, behold, there came water by the way of Edom, and the country was filled with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.21'>And when all the Moabites heard that the kings were come up to fight against them, they gathered all that were able to put on armour, and upward, and stood in the border. <note>gathered: Heb. were cried together</note><note>put on…: Heb. gird himself with a girdle</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.22'>And they rose early in the morning, and the sun shone upon the water, and the Moabites saw the water on the other side as red as blood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.23'>And they said, This is blood: the kings are surely slain, and they have smitten one another: now therefore, Moab, to the spoil. <note>slain: Heb. destroyed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.24'>And when they came to the camp of Israel, the Israelites rose and smote the Moabites, so that they fled before them: but they went forward smiting the Moabites, even in their country. <note>they went…: or, they smote in it even smiting</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.25'>And they beat down the cities, and on every good piece of land cast every man his stone, and filled it; and they stopped all the wells of water, and felled all the good trees: only in Kirharaseth they left the stones of it; but the slingers went about it, and smote it. <note>only in…: Heb. until he left its stones in Kirharaseth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.26'>And when the king of Moab saw that the battle was too fierce for him, he took with him seven hundred men that drew swords, to break through to the king of Edom: but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.3.27'>Then he took his eldest son that was to reign in his stead, and offered him for a burnt offering upon the wall. And there was great indignation against Israel: and they departed from him, and returned to their own land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Kgs.4'>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.1'>Now there cried a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets to Elisha, saying, Thy servant my husband is dead; and thou knowest that thy servant feared the LORD: and the creditor hath come to take to my two sons to be his slaves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.2'>And Elisha said to her, What shall I do for thee? tell me, what hast thou in the house? And she said, Thy handmaid hath not any thing in the house, except a pot of oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.3'>Then he said, Go, borrow thee vessels abroad of all thy neighbours, even empty vessels; borrow not a few. <note>borrow not…: or, scant not</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.4'>And when thou hast come in, thou shalt shut the door upon thee and upon thy sons, and shalt pour out into all those vessels, and thou shalt set aside that which is full.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.5'>So she went from him, and shut the door upon her and upon her sons, who brought the vessels to her; and she poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.6'>And it came to pass, when the vessels were full, that she said to her son, Bring me yet a vessel. And he said to her, There is not a vessel more. And the oil stopped flowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.7'>Then she came and told the man of God. And he said, Go, sell the oil, and pay thy debt, and live thou and thy children on the rest. <note>debt: or, creditor</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.8'>And it fell on a day, that Elisha passed to Shunem, where was a great woman; and she constrained him to eat bread. And so it was, that as oft as he passed by, he turned in there to eat bread. <note>it fell on a day: Heb. there was a day</note><note>constrained him: Heb. laid hold on him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.9'>And she said to her husband, Behold now, I perceive that this is an holy man of God, who passeth by us continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.10'>Let us make a little chamber, I pray thee, with walls; and let us set for him there a bed, and a table, and a stool, and a lampstand: and it shall be, when he cometh to us, that he shall turn in there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.11'>And it fell on a day, that he came there, and he turned into the chamber, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.12'>And he said to Gehazi his servant, Call this Shunammite. And when he had called her, she stood before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.13'>And he said to him, Say now to her, Behold, thou hast been careful for us with all this care; what is to be done for thee? wouldest thou be spoken for to the king, or to the captain of the host? And she answered, I dwell among my own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.14'>And he said, What then is to be done for her? And Gehazi answered, Verily she hath no child, and her husband is old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.15'>And he said, Call her. And when he had called her, she stood in the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.16'>And he said, About this season, next year, thou shalt embrace a son. And she said, Nay, my lord, thou man of God, do not lie to thy handmaid. <note>season: Heb. set time</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.17'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son at that season that Elisha had said to her, according to the set time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.18'>And when the child was grown, it happened on a day, that he went out to his father to the reapers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.19'>And he said to his father, My head, my head. And he said to a lad, Carry him to his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.20'>And when he had taken him, and brought him to his mother, he sat on her knees till noon, and then died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.21'>And she went up, and laid him on the bed of the man of God, and shut the door upon him, and went out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.22'>And she called to her husband, and said, Send me, I pray thee, one of the young men, and one of the donkeys, that I may run to the man of God, and come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.23'>And he said, Why wilt thou go to him to day? it is neither new moon, nor sabbath. And she said, It shall be well. <note>well: Heb. peace</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.24'>Then she saddled a donkey, and said to her servant, Drive, and go forward; slack not thy riding for me, except I bid thee. <note>slack…: Heb. restrain not for me to ride</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.25'>So she went and came to the man of God to mount Carmel. And it came to pass, when the man of God saw her afar off, that he said to Gehazi his servant, Behold, yonder is that Shunammite:</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.26'>Run now, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is it well with thee? is it well with thy husband? is it well with the child? And she answered, It is well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.27'>And when she came to the man of God to the hill, she caught him by the feet: but Gehazi came near to thrust her away. And the man of God said, Let her alone; for her soul is sorrowful within her: and the LORD hath hid it from me, and hath not told me. <note>him…: Heb. by his feet</note><note>vexed: Heb. bitter</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.28'>Then she said, Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not say, Do not deceive me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.29'>Then he said to Gehazi, Gird up thy loins, and take my staff in thy hand, and go thy way: and if thou shalt meet any man, greet him not; and if any shall greet thee, answer him not again: and lay my staff upon the face of the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Kgs.4.30'>And the mother of the child said, As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee. And he arose, and followed her.</verse>
