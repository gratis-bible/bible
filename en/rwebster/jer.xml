        <verse osisID='Jer.20.1'>Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.2'>Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.3'>And it came to pass on the next day, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magormissabib. <note>Magormissabib: that is, Fear round about</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.4'>For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.5'>Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all its labours, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall plunder them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.6'>And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.7'>O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. <note>was deceived: or, was enticed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.8'>For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.9'>Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not refrain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.10'>For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my friends watched for my fall, saying, Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. <note>All…: Heb. Every man of my peace</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.11'>But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.12'>But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for to thee have I opened my cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.13'>Sing to the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evildoers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.14'>Cursed be the day when I was born: let not the day when my mother bore me be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.15'>Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A son is born to thee; making him very glad.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.16'>And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.17'>Because he slew me not in the womb; or that my mother might have been my grave, and her womb to be always great with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.20.18'>Why was I brought out of the womb to see labour and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.21'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.1'>The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.2'>Enquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; it may be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.3'>Then said Jeremiah to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.4'>Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, who besiege you outside the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.5'>And I myself will fight against you with an outstretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.6'>And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast: they shall die by a great pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.7'>And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life: and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.8'>And to this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.9'>He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prize.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.10'>For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.11'>And concerning the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.12'>O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is made desolate out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. <note>Execute: Heb. Judge</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.13'>Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; who say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations? <note>inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.21.14'>But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in its forest, and it shall devour all things on every side of it. <note>punish: Heb. visit upon</note></verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.22'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.1'>Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.2'>And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter by these gates:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.3'>Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver him that is laid waste out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.4'>For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. <note>upon…: Heb. for David upon his throne</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.5'>But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.6'>For thus saith the LORD to the king’s house of Judah; Thou art Gilead to me, and the head of Lebanon: yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.7'>And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.8'>And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbour, Why hath the LORD done thus to this great city?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.9'>Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshipped other gods, and served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.10'>Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep bitterly for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.11'>For thus saith the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place; He shall not return there any more:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.12'>But he shall die in the place where they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.13'>Woe to him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbour’s service without wages, and giveth him not for his work;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.14'>That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is panelled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. <note>large: Heb. through–aired</note><note>windows: or, my windows</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.15'>Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.16'>He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.17'>But thy eyes and thy heart are only for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it. <note>violence: or, incursion</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.18'>Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.19'>He shall be buried with the burial of a donkey, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.22.21'>I spoke to thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidst, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou didst obey not my voice. <note>prosperity: Heb. prosperities</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.22'>The wind shall eat up all thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.23'>O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail! <note>inhabitant: Heb. inhabitress</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.24'>As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee from there;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.22.25'>And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.29'>And the land shall tremble and sorrow: for every purpose of the LORD shall be performed against Babylon, to make the land of Babylon a desolation without an inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.30'>The mighty men of Babylon have stopped fighting, they have remained in their strong holds: their might hath failed; they became as women: they have burned her dwellingplaces; her bars are broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.31'>One post shall run to meet another, and one messenger to meet another, to show the king of Babylon that his city is taken at one end,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Jer.51.33'>For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; The daughter of Babylon is like a threshingfloor, it is time to thresh her: yet a little while, and the time of her harvest shall come. <note>it is…: or, in the time that he thresheth her</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.51.34'>Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicacies, he hath cast me out.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Jer.52'>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.1'>Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was Hamutal the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. <note>began…: Heb. reigned</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.2'>And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.3'>For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.4'>And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it, and built forts against it on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.5'>So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.6'>And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was great in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.7'>Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king’s garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city on all sides:) and they went by the way of the plain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.8'>But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.9'>Then they took the king, and carried him to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.10'>And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.11'>Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. <note>put out: Heb. blinded</note><note>chains: or, fetters</note><note>prison: Heb. house of the wards</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.12'>Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, <note>captain…: or, chief marshal: Heb. chief of the executioners, or, slaughtermen</note><note>served: Heb. stood before</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.13'>And burned the house of the LORD, and the king’s house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men, he burned with fire:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.14'>And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem on every side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.15'>Then Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the rest of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.16'>But Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vinedressers and for farmers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.17'>Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.18'>The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass by which they ministered, they took away. <note>shovels: or, instruments to remove the ashes</note><note>bowls: or, basons</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.19'>And the basins, and the firepans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the lampstands, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, the captain of the guard took away. <note>firepans: or, censers</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.20'>The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brasen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. <note>the brass: Heb. their brass</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.21'>And concerning the pillars, the height of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a band of twelve cubits surrounded it; and the thickness of it was four fingers: it was hollow. <note>fillet: Heb. thread</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.22'>And a capital of brass was upon it; and the height of one capital was five cubits, with network and pomegranates upon the capitals around, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.23'>And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the network were an hundred on all sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.24'>And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: <note>door: Heb. threshold</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.25'>He took also out of the city an eunuch, who had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king’s person, who were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. <note>were near…: Heb. saw the face of the king</note><note>principal…: or, scribe of the captain of the host</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.26'>So Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.27'>And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.28'>This is the people whom Nebuchadnezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.29'>In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty and two persons: <note>persons: Heb. souls</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.30'>In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadnezzar Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred and forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.31'>And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out of prison,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.32'>And spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon, <note>kindly…: Heb. good things with him</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.33'>And changed his prison garments: and he continually ate bread before him all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Jer.52.34'>And for his food, there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life. <note>every…: Heb. the matter of the day in his day</note></verse>
