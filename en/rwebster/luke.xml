  <div type='book' osisID='Luke'>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.1'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.1'>Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set forth in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.2'>Even as they delivered them to us, who from the beginning were eyewitnesses, and ministers of the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.3'>It seemed good to me also, having had perfect understanding of all things from the very first, to write to thee in order, most excellent Theophilus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.4'>That thou mayest know the certainty of those things, in which thou hast been instructed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.5'>There was in the days of Herod, the king of Judaea, a certain priest named Zacharias, of the course of Abijah: and his wife was of the daughters of Aaron, and her name was Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.6'>And they were both righteous before God, walking in all the commandments and ordinances of the Lord blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.7'>And they had no child, because Elisabeth was barren, and they both were well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.8'>And it came to pass, that while he executed the priest’s office before God in the order of his course,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.9'>According to the custom of the priest’s office, his lot was to burn incense when he went into the temple of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.10'>And the whole multitude of the people were praying outside at the time of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.11'>And there appeared to him an angel of the Lord standing on the right side of the altar of incense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.12'>And when Zacharias saw him, he was troubled, and fear fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.13'>But the angel said to him, Fear not, Zacharias: for thy prayer is heard; and thy wife Elisabeth shall bear thee a son, and thou shalt call his name John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.14'>And thou shalt have joy and gladness; and many shall rejoice at his birth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.15'>For he shall be great in the sight of the Lord, and shall drink neither wine nor strong drink; and he shall be filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother’s womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.16'>And many of the children of Israel shall he turn to the Lord their God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.17'>And he shall go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah, to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children, and the disobedient to the wisdom of the just; to make ready a people prepared for the Lord. <note>to the wisdom: or, by the wisdom</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.18'>And Zacharias said to the angel, How shall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well advanced in years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.19'>And the angel answering said to him, I am Gabriel, who stand in the presence of God; and am sent to speak to thee, and to show thee these glad tidings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.20'>And, behold, thou shalt be dumb, and not able to speak, until the day that these things shall be performed, because thou believest not my words, which shall be fulfilled in their season.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.21'>And the people waited for Zacharias, and marvelled that he tarried so long in the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.22'>And when he came out, he could not speak to them: and they perceived that he had seen a vision in the temple: for he made signs to them, and remained speechless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.23'>And it came to pass, that, as soon as the days of his ministration were accomplished, he departed to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.24'>And after those days his wife Elisabeth conceived, and hid herself five months, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.25'>Thus hath the Lord dealt with me in the days when he looked on me, to take away my reproach among men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.26'>And in the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, named Nazareth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.27'>To a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David; and the virgin’s name was Mary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.28'>And the angel came to her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women. <note>highly…: or, graciously accepted, or, of much grace</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.29'>And when she saw him, she was troubled at his saying, and considered in her mind what manner of greeting this should be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.30'>And the angel said to her, Fear not, Mary: for thou hast found favour with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.31'>And, behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call his name JESUS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.32'>He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest: and the Lord God shall give to him the throne of his father David:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.33'>And he shall reign over the house of Jacob for ever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.34'>Then said Mary to the angel, How shall this be, seeing I know not a man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.35'>And the angel answered and said to her, The Holy Spirit shall come upon thee, and the power of the Highest shall overshadow thee: therefore also that holy thing who shall be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.36'>And, behold, thy cousin Elisabeth, hath also conceived a son in her old age: and this is the sixth month with her, who was called barren.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.37'>For with God nothing shall be impossible.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.38'>And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it to me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.39'>And Mary arose in those days, and went into the hill country with haste, into a city of Judah;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.40'>And entered into the house of Zacharias, and greeted Elisabeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.41'>And it came to pass, that, when Elisabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the babe leaped in her womb; and Elisabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.42'>And she spoke with a loud voice, and said, Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.43'>And why is this granted to me, that the mother of my Lord should come to me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.44'>For, lo, as soon as the voice of thy greeting sounded in my ears, the babe leaped in my womb for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.45'>And blessed is she that believed: that there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the Lord. <note>that…: or, which believed that there</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.46'>And Mary said, My soul doth magnify the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.47'>And my spirit hath rejoiced in God my Saviour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.48'>For he hath regarded the low estate of his handmaiden: for, behold, from henceforth all generations shall call me blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.49'>For he that is mighty hath done to me great things; and holy is his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.50'>And his mercy is on them that fear him from generation to generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.51'>He hath shown strength with his arm; he hath scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.52'>He hath put down the mighty from their seats, and exalted them of low degree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.53'>He hath filled the hungry with good things; and the rich he hath sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.54'>He hath helped his servant Israel, in remembrance of his mercy;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.55'>As he spoke to our fathers, to Abraham, and to his seed for ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.56'>And Mary abode with her about three months, and returned to her own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.57'>Now Elisabeth’s full time came that she should be delivered; and she brought forth a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.58'>And her neighbours and her cousins heard that the Lord had shown great mercy upon her; and they rejoiced with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.59'>And it came to pass, that on the eighth day they came to circumcise the child; and they called him Zacharias, after the name of his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.60'>And his mother answered and said, Not so; but he shall be called John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.61'>And they said to her, There is none of thy kindred that is called by this name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.62'>And they made signs to his father, how he would have him called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.63'>And he asked for a writing tablet, and wrote, saying, His name is John. And they all marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.64'>And his mouth was opened immediately, and his tongue loosed, and he spoke, and praised God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.65'>And fear came on all that dwelt around them: and all these sayings were noised abroad throughout all the hill country of Judaea. <note>sayings: or, things</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.66'>And all they that had heard them laid them up in their hearts, saying, What manner of child shall this be! And the hand of the Lord was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.67'>And his father Zacharias was filled with the Holy Spirit, and prophesied, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.68'>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel; for he hath visited and redeemed his people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.69'>And hath raised up an horn of salvation for us in the house of his servant David;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.70'>As he spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets, who have been since the world began:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.71'>That we should be saved from our enemies, and from the hand of all that hate us;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.72'>To perform the mercy promised to our fathers, and to remember his holy covenant;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.73'>The oath which he swore to our father Abraham,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.74'>That he would grant to us, that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.75'>In holiness and righteousness before him, all the days of our life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.76'>And thou, child, shalt be called the prophet of the Highest: for thou shalt go before the face of the Lord to prepare his ways;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.77'>To give knowledge of salvation to his people by the remission of their sins, <note>by: or, for</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.78'>Through the tender mercy of our God; with which the dayspring from on high hath visited us, <note>tender…: or, bowels of the mercy</note><note>dayspring: or, sunrising, or, branch</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.79'>To give light to them that sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.1.80'>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, and was in the deserts till the day of his showing to Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.2'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.1'>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. <note>taxed: or, enrolled</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.2'>(And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.3'>And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city. <note>taxed: or, enrolled</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.4'>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth, into Judaea, to the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; (because he was of the house and lineage of David:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.5'>To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. <note>taxed: or, enrolled</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.6'>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.7'>And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger; because there was no room for them in the inn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.8'>And there were in the same country shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. <note>watch: or, the night watches</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.9'>And, lo, the angel of the Lord came upon them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them: and they were in great fear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.10'>And the angel said to them, Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.11'>For to you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, who is Christ the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.12'>And this shall be a sign to you; Ye shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes, lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.13'>And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host praising God, and saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.14'>Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.15'>And it came to pass, when the angels had gone away from them into heaven, the shepherds said one to another, Let us now go even to Bethlehem, and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known to us. <note>the shepherds: Gr. the men the shepherds</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.16'>And they came with haste, and found Mary, and Joseph, and the babe lying in a manger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.17'>And when they had seen it, they made known abroad the saying which was told them concerning this child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.18'>And all they that heard it wondered at those things which were told them by the shepherds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.19'>But Mary kept all these things, and pondered them in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.20'>And the shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things that they had heard and seen, as it was told to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.21'>And when eight days were accomplished for the circumcising of the child, his name was called JESUS, who was so named by the angel before he was conceived in the womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.22'>And when the days of her purification according to the law of Moses were accomplished, they brought him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.23'>(As it is written in the law of the Lord, Every male that openeth the womb shall be called holy to the Lord;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.24'>And to offer a sacrifice according to that which is said in the law of the Lord, A pair of turtledoves, or two young pigeons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.25'>And, behold, there was a man in Jerusalem, whose name was Simeon; and the same man was righteous and devout, waiting for the consolation of Israel: and the Holy Spirit was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.26'>And it was revealed to him by the Holy Spirit, that he should not see death, before he had seen the Lord’s Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.27'>And he came by the Spirit into the temple: and when the parents brought in the child Jesus, to do for him after the custom of the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.28'>Then he took him up in his arms, and blessed God, and said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.29'>Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.30'>For my eyes have seen thy salvation,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.31'>Which thou hast prepared before the face of all people;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.32'>A light to enlighten the Gentiles, and the glory of thy people Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.33'>And Joseph and his mother marvelled at those things which were spoken concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.34'>And Simeon blessed them, and said to Mary his mother, Behold, this child is set for the fall and rising again of many in Israel; and for a sign which shall be spoken against;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.35'>(And, a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also,) that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.36'>And there was one Anna, a prophetess, the daughter of Phanuel, of the tribe of Asher: she was of a great age, and had lived with an husband seven years from her virginity;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.37'>And she was a widow of about eighty and four years, who departed not from the temple, but served God with fastings and prayers night and day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.38'>And she coming in that instant gave thanks likewise to the Lord, and spoke of him to all them that looked for redemption in Jerusalem. <note>Jerusalem: or, Israel</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.39'>And when they had performed all things according to the law of the Lord, they returned into Galilee, to their own city Nazareth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.40'>And the child grew, and became strong in spirit, filled with wisdom: and the grace of God was upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.41'>Now his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.42'>And when he was twelve years old, they went up to Jerusalem according to the custom of the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.43'>And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph and his mother knew not of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.44'>But they, supposing him to be in the company, went a day’s journey; and they sought him among their kinsfolk and acquaintance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.45'>And when they found him not, they returned to Jerusalem, seeking him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.46'>And it came to pass, that after three days they found him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both hearing them, and asking them questions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.47'>And all that heard him were astonished at his understanding and answers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.48'>And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his mother said to him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.49'>And he said to them, How is it that ye sought me? knew ye not that I must be about my Father’s business?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.50'>And they understood not the saying which he spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.51'>And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them: but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.2.52'>And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in favour with God and man. <note>stature: or, age</note></verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.3'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.1'>Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judaea, and Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother Philip tetrarch of Ituraea and of the region of Trachonitis, and Lysanias the tetrarch of Abilene, <note>tetrarch: or, governor of four provinces</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.2'>Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came to John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.3'>And he came into all the country about Jordan, preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.4'>As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.3.6'>And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.7'>Then said he to the multitude that came forth to be baptized by him, O generation of vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.3.8'>Bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance, and begin not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for our father: for I say to you, That God is able of these stones to raise up children to Abraham. <note>worthy of: or, meet for</note></verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.7.6'>Then Jesus went with them. And when he was now not far from the house, the centurion sent friends to him, saying to him, Lord, trouble not thyself: for I am not worthy that thou shouldest enter under my roof:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.1'>And it came to pass afterward, that he went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.2'>And certain women, who had been healed of evil spirits and infirmities, Mary called Magdalene, out of whom went seven demons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.3'>And Joanna the wife of Chuza Herod’s steward, and Susanna, and many others, who ministered to him of their substance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.4'>And when many people were gathered together, and had come to him out of every city, he spoke by a parable:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.5'>A sower went out to sow his seed: and as he sowed, some fell by the way side; and it was trodden down, and the fowls of the air devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.6'>And some fell upon a rock; and as soon as it was sprung up, it withered away, because it lacked moisture.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.7'>And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprang up with it, and choked it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.8'>And other fell on good ground, and sprang up, and bore fruit an hundredfold. And when he had said these things, he cried, He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.9'>And his disciples asked him, saying, What doth this parable mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.10'>And he said, To you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God: but to others in parables; that seeing they may not see, and hearing they may not understand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.11'>Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.12'>Those by the way side are they that hear; then cometh the devil, and taketh away the word out of their hearts, lest they should believe and be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.13'>They on the rock are they, who, when they hear, receive the word with joy; and these have no root, who for a while believe, and in time of temptation fall away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.14'>And that which fell among thorns are they, who, when they have heard, go forth, and are choked with cares and riches and pleasures of this life, and bring no fruit to perfection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.15'>But that on the good ground are they, who in an honest and good heart, having heard the word, keep it, and bring forth fruit with patience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.16'>No man, when he hath lighted a lamp, covereth it with a vessel, or putteth it under a bed; but setteth it on a lampstand, that they who enter in may see the light.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.21'>And he answered and said to them, My mother and my brethren are these who hear the word of God, and do it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.22'>Now it came to pass on a certain day, that he went into a boat with his disciples: and he said to them, Let us go over to the other side of the lake. And they launched forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.8.23'>But as they sailed he fell asleep: and there came down a storm of wind on the lake; and they were filled with water, and were in jeopardy.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.29'>(For he had commanded the unclean spirit to come out of the man. For often it had caught him: and he was kept bound with chains and in fetters; and he broke the bands, and was driven by the demon into the wilderness.)</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.32'>And there was there an herd of many swine feeding on the mountain: and they besought him that he would allow them to enter into them. And he permitted them.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.35'>Then they went out to see what was done; and came to Jesus, and found the man, out of whom the demons had departed, sitting at the feet of Jesus, clothed, and in his right mind: and they were afraid.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.8.41'>And, behold, there came a man named Jairus, and he was a ruler of the synagogue: and he fell down at the feet of Jesus, and besought him that he would come into his house:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.9.29'>And as he prayed, the appearance of his countenance was altered, and his raiment was white and shining.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.30'>And, behold, there talked with him two men, who were Moses and Elijah:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.31'>Who appeared in glory, and spoke of his decease which he should accomplish at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.32'>But Peter and they that were with him were heavy with sleep: and when they were awake, they saw his glory, and the two men that stood with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.33'>And it came to pass, as they departed from him, Peter said to Jesus, Master, it is good for us to be here: and let us make three tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah: not knowing what he said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.34'>While he was thus speaking, there came a cloud, and overshadowed them: and they feared as they entered into the cloud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.35'>And there came a voice out of the cloud, saying, This is my beloved Son: hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.36'>And when the voice was past, Jesus was found alone. And they kept it close, and told no man in those days any of those things which they had seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.37'>And it came to pass, that on the next day, when they had come down from the mountain, many people met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.38'>And, behold, a man of the company cried out, saying, Master, I beseech thee, look upon my son: for he is my only child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.39'>And, lo, a spirit taketh him, and he suddenly crieth out; and it teareth him that he foameth, and bruising him hardly departeth from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.40'>And I besought thy disciples to cast him out; and they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.41'>And Jesus answering said, O faithless and perverse generation, how long shall I be with you, and put up with you? Bring thy son here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.42'>And as he was yet coming, the demon threw him down, and tore him. And Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, and healed the child, and delivered him again to his father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.43'>And they were all amazed at the mighty power of God. But while they were all amazed at all things which Jesus did, he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.44'>Let these sayings sink down into your ears: for the Son of man shall be delivered into the hands of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.45'>But they understood not this saying, and it was hid from them, that they perceived it not: and they feared to ask him concerning that saying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.46'>Then there arose a reasoning among them, which of them should be greatest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.47'>And Jesus, perceiving the thought of their heart, took a child, and set him by him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.48'>And said to them, Whoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me: and whoever shall receive me receiveth him that sent me: for he that is least among you all, the same shall be great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.49'>And John answered and said, Master, we saw one casting out demons in thy name; and we forbad him, because he followeth not with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.50'>And Jesus said to him, Forbid him not: for he that is not against us is for us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.51'>And it came to pass, when the time was come that he should be received up, he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.52'>And sent messengers before his face: and they went, and entered into a village of the Samaritans, to make ready for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.53'>And they did not receive him, because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.54'>And when his disciples James and John saw this, they said, Lord, wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven, and consume them, even as Elijah did?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.55'>But he turned, and rebuked them, and said, Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.56'>For the Son of man is not come to destroy men’s lives, but to save them. And they went to another village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.57'>And it came to pass, that, as they were going in the way, a certain man said to him, Lord, I will follow thee wherever thou goest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.58'>And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath no where to lay his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.59'>And he said to another, Follow me. But he said, Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.60'>Jesus said to him, Let the dead bury their dead: but go thou and preach the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.61'>And another also said, Lord, I will follow thee; but let me first go and bid them farewell, who are at my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.9.62'>And Jesus said to him, No man, having put his hand to the plow, and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.20'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And it came to pass, that on one of those days, as he taught the people in the temple, and preached the gospel, the chief priests and the scribes came upon him with the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>And spoke to him, saying, Tell us, by what authority doest thou these things? or who is he that gave thee this authority?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>And he answered and said to them, I will also ask you one thing; and answer me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>The baptism of John, was it from heaven, or from men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say, From heaven; he will say, Why then believed ye him not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>But if we say, From men; all the people will stone us: for they are persuaded that John was a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they answered, that they could not tell where it was from.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And Jesus said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>Then he began to speak to the people this parable; A certain man planted a vineyard, and let it out to vinedressers, and went into a far country for a long time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And at the season he sent a servant to the vinedressers, that they should give him of the fruit of the vineyard: but the vinedressers beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And again he sent another servant: and they beat him also, and treated him shamefully, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And again he sent the third: and they wounded him also, and cast him out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Then said the lord of the vineyard, What shall I do? I will send my beloved son: it may be when they see him they will reverence him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>But when the vinedressers saw him, they reasoned among themselves, saying, This is the heir: come, let us kill him, that the inheritance may be ours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>So they cast him out of the vineyard, and killed him. What therefore shall the lord of the vineyard do to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He shall come and destroy these vinedressers, and shall give the vineyard to others. And when they heard it, they said, may that never be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>And he beheld them, and said, What is this then that is written, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>Whoever shall fall upon that stone shall be broken; but on whomever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And the chief priests and the scribes the same hour sought to lay hands on him; and they feared the people: for they perceived that he had spoken this parable against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And they watched him, and sent forth spies, who pretended to be righteous men, that they might take hold of his words, that so they might deliver him to the power and authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying, Master, we know that thou sayest and teachest rightly, neither acceptest thou the person of any, but teachest the way of God truly: <note>truly: or, of a truth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to give tribute to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>But he perceived their craftiness, and said to them, Why tempt ye me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Show me a penny. Whose image and superscription hath it? They answered and said, Caesar’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>And he said to them, Render therefore to Caesar the things which are Caesar’s, and to God the things which are God’s.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And they could not take hold of his words before the people: and they marvelled at his answer, and held their peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Then came to him certain of the Sadducees, who deny that there is any resurrection; and they asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>Saying, Master, Moses wrote to us, If any man’s brother should die, having a wife, and he should die without children, that his brother should take his wife, and raise up seed to his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>There were therefore seven brothers: and the first took a wife, and died without children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And the second took her for a wife, and he died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>And the third took her; and in like manner the seven also: and they left no children, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last of all the woman died also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>Therefore in the resurrection whose wife of them is she? for seven had her for a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And Jesus answering said to them, The children of this world marry, and are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>But they who shall be accounted worthy to obtain that world, and the resurrection from the dead, neither marry, nor are given in marriage:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>Neither can they die any more: for they are equal to the angels; and are the children of God, being the children of the resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>Now that the dead are raised, even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>For he is not a God of the dead, but of the living: for all live to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Then certain of the scribes answering said, Master, thou hast well said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>And after that they dared not ask him any question at all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>And he said to them, How say they that Christ is David’s son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>And David himself saith in the book of Psalms, The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>Till I make thy enemies thy footstool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore calleth him Lord, how is he then his son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Then in the hearing of all the people he said to his disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, who desire to walk in long robes, and love greetings in the markets, and the highest seats in the synagogues, and the best places at feasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>Who devour widows’ houses, and for a show make long prayers: the same shall receive greater condemnation.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.23'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.1'>And the whole multitude of them arose, and led him to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.2'>And they began to accuse him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that he himself is Christ a King.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.3'>And Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And he answered him and said, Thou sayest it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.4'>Then said Pilate to the chief priests and to the people, I find no fault in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.5'>And they were the more fierce, saying, He stirreth up the people, teaching throughout all Judaea, beginning from Galilee to this place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.6'>When Pilate heard of Galilee, he asked whether the man was a Galilaean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.7'>And as soon as he knew that he belonged to Herod’s jurisdiction, he sent him to Herod, who himself was also at Jerusalem at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.8'>And when Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding glad: for he had been for a long time, desirous to see him, because he had heard many things of him; and he hoped to see some miracle done by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.9'>Then he questioned with him in many words; but he answered him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.10'>And the chief priests and scribes stood and vehemently accused him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.11'>And Herod with his soldiers treated him with contempt, and mocked him, and arrayed him in a gorgeous robe, and sent him again to Pilate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.12'>And the same day Pilate and Herod were made friends together: for before they were at enmity between themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.13'>And Pilate, when he had called together the chief priests and the rulers and the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.14'>Said to them, Ye have brought this man to me, as one that perverteth the people: and, behold, I, having examined him before you, have found no fault in this man concerning those things of which ye accuse him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.15'>No, nor yet Herod: for I sent you to him; and, lo, nothing worthy of death is done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.16'>I will therefore chastise him, and release him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.17'>(For of necessity he must release one to them at the feast.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.18'>And they cried out all at once, saying, Away with this man, and release to us Barabbas:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.19'>(Who for a certain sedition made in the city, and for murder, was cast into prison.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.20'>Pilate therefore, willing to release Jesus, spoke again to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.21'>But they cried, saying, Crucify him, crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.22'>And he said to them the third time, Why, what evil hath he done? I have found no cause of death in him: I will therefore chastise him, and let him go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.23'>And they were insistent with loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified. And the voices of them and of the chief priests prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.24'>And Pilate gave sentence that it should be as they required. <note>gave…: or, assented</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.25'>And he released to them him that for sedition and murder had been cast into prison, whom they had desired; but he delivered Jesus to their will.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.26'>And as they led him away, they laid hold upon one Simon, a Cyrenian, coming out of the country, and on him they laid the cross, that he might bear it after Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.27'>And there followed him a great company of people, and of women, who also bewailed and lamented him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.28'>But Jesus turning to them said, Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me, but weep for yourselves, and for your children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.29'>For, behold, the days are coming, in which they shall say, Blessed are the barren, and the wombs that never bore, and the breasts which never nursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.30'>Then shall they begin to say to the mountains, Fall on us; and to the hills, Cover us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.31'>For if they do these things in a green tree, what shall be done in the dry?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.32'>And two others, who were malefactors, were led with him to be put to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.33'>And when they had come to the place, which is called Calvary, there they crucified him, and the malefactors, one on the right hand, and the other on the left. <note>Calvary: or, The place of a skull</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.34'>Then said Jesus, Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do. And they parted his raiment, and cast lots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.35'>And the people stood beholding. And the rulers also with them mocked him, saying, He saved others; let him save himself, if he is Christ, the chosen of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.36'>And the soldiers also mocked him, coming to him, and offering him vinegar,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.37'>And saying, If thou art the king of the Jews, save thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.38'>And a superscription also was written over him in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew, THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.39'>And one of the malefactors who were hanged railed on him, saying, If thou art Christ, save thyself and us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.40'>But the other answering rebuked him, saying, Dost not thou fear God, seeing thou art in the same condemnation?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.41'>And we indeed justly; for we receive the due reward of our deeds: but this man hath done nothing amiss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.42'>And he said to Jesus, Lord, remember me when thou comest into thy kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.43'>And Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.44'>And it was about the sixth hour, and there was a darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. <note>earth: or, land</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.45'>And the sun was darkened, and the veil of the temple was torn in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.46'>And when Jesus had cried with a loud voice, he said, Father, into thy hands I commend my spirit: and having said thus, he gave up the ghost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.47'>Now when the centurion saw what was done, he glorified God, saying, Certainly this was a righteous man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.48'>And all the people that came together to that sight, beholding the things which were done, smote their breasts, and returned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.49'>And all his acquaintance, and the women that followed him from Galilee, stood afar off, beholding these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.50'>And, behold, there was a man named Joseph, a counsellor; and he was a good man, and a just:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.51'>(The same had not consented to the counsel and deed of them;) he was of Arimathaea, a city of the Jews: who also himself waited for the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.52'>This man went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.53'>And he took it down, and wrapped it in linen, and laid it in a sepulchre that was hewn in stone, where man was never before laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.54'>And that day was the preparation, and the sabbath drew on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.55'>And the women also, who came with him from Galilee, followed after, and beheld the sepulchre, and how his body was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.23.56'>And they returned, and prepared spices and ointments; and rested on the sabbath according to the commandment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.24'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.1'>Now upon the first day of the week, very early in the morning, they came to the sepulchre, bringing the spices which they had prepared, and certain others with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.2'>And they found the stone rolled away from the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.3'>And they entered in, and found not the body of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.4'>And it came to pass, as they were much perplexed about this, behold, two men stood by them in shining garments:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.5'>And as they were afraid, and bowed down their faces to the earth, they said to them, Why seek ye the living among the dead? <note>the living: or, him that liveth</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.6'>He is not here, but is risen: remember how he spoke to you when he was yet in Galilee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.7'>Saying, The Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and the third day rise again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.8'>And they remembered his words,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.9'>And returned from the sepulchre, and told all these things to the eleven, and to all the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.10'>It was Mary Magdalene, and Joanna, and Mary the mother of James, and other women that were with them, who told these things to the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.11'>And their words seemed to them as idle tales, and they believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.12'>Then Peter arose, and ran to the sepulchre; and stooping down, he beheld the linen clothes laid by themselves, and departed, wondering in himself at that which had come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.13'>And, behold, two of them went that same day to a village called Emmaus, which was from Jerusalem about sixty furlongs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.14'>And they talked together of all these things which had happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.15'>And it came to pass, that, while they communed together and reasoned, Jesus himself drew near, and went with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.16'>But their eyes were restrained that they should not know him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.17'>And he said to them, What manner of communications are these that ye have one to another, as ye walk, and are sad?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.18'>And one of them, whose name was Cleopas, answering said to him, Art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem, and hast not known the things which have come to pass there in these days?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.19'>And he said to them, What things? And they said to him, Concerning Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet mighty in deed and word before God and all the people:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.20'>And how the chief priests and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to death, and crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.21'>But we hoped that it had been he who should have redeemed Israel: and besides all this, to day is the third day since these things were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.22'>Yea, and certain women also of our company made us astonished, who were early at the sepulchre;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.23'>And when they found not his body, they came, saying, that they had also seen a vision of angels, who said that he was alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.24'>And certain of them who were with us went to the sepulchre, and found it even so as the women had said: but him they saw not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.25'>Then he said to them, O fools, and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.26'>Ought not Christ to suffer these things, and to enter into his glory?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.27'>And beginning at Moses and all the prophets, he expounded to them in all the scriptures the things concerning himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.28'>And they drew near to the village, where they were going: and he made as though he would go further.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.29'>But they constrained him, saying, Abide with us: for it is toward evening, and the day is far spent. And he went in to tarry with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.30'>And it came to pass, as he sat eating with them, he took bread, and blessed it, and broke, and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.31'>And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight. <note>vanished…: or, ceased to be seen of them</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.32'>And they said one to another, Did not our heart burn within us, while he talked with us by the way, and while he opened to us the scriptures?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.33'>And they rose up the same hour, and returned to Jerusalem, and found the eleven gathered together, and them that were with them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.34'>Saying, The Lord is risen indeed, and hath appeared to Simon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.35'>And they told what things were done in the way, and how he was known to them in breaking of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>And as they were thus speaking, Jesus himself stood in the midst of them, and saith to them, Peace be to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>But they were terrified and trembled, and supposed that they had seen a spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.38'>And he said to them, Why are ye troubled? and why do thoughts arise in your hearts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.39'>Behold my hands and my feet, that it is I myself: handle me, and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as ye see me have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.40'>And when he had thus spoken, he showed them his hands and his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.41'>And while they yet believed not for joy, and wondered, he said to them, Have ye here any thing to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.42'>And they gave him a piece of a broiled fish, and of an honeycomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.43'>And he took it, and ate before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.44'>And he said to them, These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you, that all things must be fulfilled, which were written in the law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.45'>Then he opened their understanding, that they might understand the scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.46'>And said to them, Thus it is written, and thus it was necessary for Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead the third day:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.47'>And that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations, beginning at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.48'>And ye are witnesses of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.49'>And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you: but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem, until ye are endued with power from on high.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.50'>And he led them out as far as to Bethany, and he lifted up his hands, and blessed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.51'>And it came to pass, while he blessed them, he was parted from them, and carried up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.52'>And they worshipped him, and returned to Jerusalem with great joy:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.53'>And were continually in the temple, praising and blessing God. Amen.</verse>
