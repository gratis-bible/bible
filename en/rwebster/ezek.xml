      <chapter osisID='Ezek.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God. <note>captives: Heb. captivity</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fifth day of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin’s captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>The word of the LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar; and the hand of the LORD was there upon him. <note>Ezekiel: Heb. Jehezkel</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and, behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and from the midst of it as the colour of amber, from the midst of the fire. <note>infolding…: Heb. catching itself</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>Also from the midst of it came the likeness of four living beings. And this was their appearance; they had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And every one had four faces, and every one had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf’s foot: and they sparkled like the colour of burnished brass. <note>straight…: Heb. a straight foot</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>Their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, they four had the face of a man, and the face of a lion, on the right side: and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>Thus were their faces: and their wings were stretched upward; two wings of every one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies. <note>stretched…: or, divided above</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went every one straight forward: wherever the spirit was to go, they went; and they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living beings, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps: it went up and down among the living beings; and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living beings ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I beheld the living beings, behold one wheel upon the earth by the living beings, with his four faces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like the colour of a beryl: and they four had one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the middle of a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went upon their four sides: and they turned not when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rims, they were so high that they were dreadful; and their rims were full of eyes all around them four. <note>and their rings: or, and their strakes</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living beings went, the wheels went by them: and when the living beings were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit was to go, they went, there was their spirit to go; and the wheels were lifted up together with them: for the spirit of the living being was in the wheels. <note>of…: or, of life</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went; and when those stood, these stood; and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up together with them: for the spirit of the living being was in the wheels. <note>of…: or, of life</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And the likeness of the firmament upon the heads of the living being was as the colour of the terrible crystal, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other: every one had two, which covered on this side, and every one had two, which covered on that side, their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, the voice of speech, as the noise of an host: when they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice from the firmament that was over their heads, when they stood, and had let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as the colour of amber, as the appearance of fire around within it, from the appearance of his loins even upward, and from the appearance of his loins even downward, I saw as it were the appearance of fire, and it had brightness on all sides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness all around. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I heard a voice of one speaking.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And the spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet, that I heard him that spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious nation that hath rebelled against me: they and their fathers have transgressed against me, even to this very day. <note>nation: Heb. nations</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>For they are impudent children and obstinate in heart. I send thee to them; and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD. <note>impudent: Heb. hard of face</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, (for they are a rebellious house,) yet shall know that there hath been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dost dwell among scorpions: be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house. <note>briers…: or, rebels</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And thou shalt speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear: for they are most rebellious. <note>most…: Heb. rebellion</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee; Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house: open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And when I looked, behold, an hand was sent to me; and, lo, a scroll was in it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And he spread it before me; and it was written within and without: and there was written in it lamentations, and mourning, and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, eat what thou findest; eat this scroll, and go speak to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that scroll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said to me, Son of man, cause thy stomach to eat, and fill thy body with this scroll that I give thee. Then did I eat it; and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said to me, Son of man, depart, go to the house of Israel, and speak with my words to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For thou art not sent to a people of a strange speech and of an hard language, but to the house of Israel; <note>of a…: Heb. deep of lip, and heavy of tongue</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>Not to many people of a strange speech and of an hard language, whose words thou canst not understand. Surely, had I sent thee to them, they would have hearkened to thee. <note>of a…: Heb. deep of lip, and heavy of language</note><note>Surely…: or, If I had sent thee, etc. would they not have hearkened unto thee?</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee; for they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are impudent and hardhearted. <note>impudent…: Heb. stiff of forehead, and hard of heart</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made thy face strong against their faces, and thy forehead strong against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant harder than flint have I made thy forehead: fear them not, neither be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And depart, go to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing, saying, Blessed be the glory of the LORD from his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>I heard also the noise of the wings of the living beings that touched one another, and the noise of the wheels beside them, and the noise of a great rushing. <note>touched: Heb. kissed</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the spirit lifted me up, and took me away, and I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit; but the hand of the LORD was strong upon me. <note>in bitterness: Heb. bitter</note><note>heat: Heb. hot anger</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to them of the captivity at Telabib, that dwelt by the river of Chebar, and I sat where they sat, and remained there overwhelmed among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die; and thou givest him not warning, nor speakest to warn the wicked from his wicked way, to save his life; the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if thou shalt warn the wicked, and he will not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity; but thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, When a righteous man doth turn from his righteousness, and commit iniquity, and I lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die: because thou hast not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteousness which he hath done shall not be remembered; but his blood will I require at thy hand. <note>righteousness which: Heb. righteousnesses</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if thou shalt warn the righteous man, that the righteous sin not, and he doth not sin, he shall surely live, because he is warned; also thou hast delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of the LORD was there upon me; and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will there talk with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain: and, behold, the glory of the LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river of Chebar: and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet, and spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But thou, O son of man, behold, they shall put cords upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not go out among them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will make thy tongue cleave to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: for they are a rebellious house. <note>a reprover: Heb. a man reproving</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; He that heareth, let him hear; and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it the city, even Jerusalem:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>And lay siege against it, and build a fort against it, and cast a mound against it; set the camp also against it, and set battering rams against it on every side. <note>battering…: chief leaders</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>Moreover take thou to thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel. <note>an…: or, a flat plate, or, slice</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Lie thou also upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it: according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon it thou shalt bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days, three hundred and ninety days: so shalt thou bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And when thou hast accomplished them, lie again on thy right side, and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days: I have appointed thee each day for a year. <note>each…: Heb. a day for a year, a day for a year</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>Therefore thou shalt set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, and thy arm shall be uncovered, and thou shalt prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I will lay cords upon thee, and thou shalt not turn thee from one side to another, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege. <note>from one…: Heb. from thy side to thy side</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Take thou also to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentiles, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread of them, according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side, three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat of it. <note>fitches: or, spelt</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And thy food which thou shalt eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day: from time to time shalt thou eat it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>Thou shalt drink also water by measure, the sixth part of an hin: from time to time shalt thou drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And thou shalt eat it as barley cakes, and thou shalt bake it with dung that cometh out of man, in their sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And the LORD said, Even thus shall the children of Israel eat their defiled bread among the Gentiles, where I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then said I, Ah Lord GOD! behold, my soul hath not been polluted: for from my youth even till now have I not eaten of that which dieth of itself, or is torn in pieces; neither hath abominable flesh come into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then he said to me, Lo, I have given thee cow’s dung for man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy bread with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care; and they shall drink water by measure, and in horror:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>That they may lack bread and water, and be appalled one with another, and pine away for their iniquity.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife, take thee a barber’s razor, and cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard: then take to thee balances to weigh, and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>Thou shalt burn with fire a third part in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are fulfilled: and thou shalt take a third part, and smite about it with a sword: and a third part thou shalt scatter in the wind; and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>Thou shalt also take of them a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts. <note>skirts: Heb. wings</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>Then take of them again, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire; from which a fire shall come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus saith the Lord GOD; This is Jerusalem: I have set it in the midst of the nations and countries that are around her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she hath changed my judgments into wickedness more than the nations, and my statutes more than the countries that are around her: for they have refused my judgments and my statutes, they have not walked in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Because ye multiplied more than the nations that are around you, and have not walked in my statutes, neither have kept my judgments, neither have done according to the judgments of the nations that are around you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and the like of which I will not do any more, because of all thy abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers; and I will execute judgments in thee, and the whole remnant of thee will I scatter into all the winds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord GOD; Surely, because thou hast defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thy abominations, therefore I will also diminish thee; neither shall my eye spare, neither will I have any pity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and with famine shall they be consumed in the midst of thee: and a third part shall fall by the sword around thee; and I will scatter a third part into all the winds, and I will draw out a sword after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus shall my anger be accomplished, and I will cause my fury to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the LORD have spoken it in my zeal, when I have accomplished my fury in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make thee waste, and a reproach among the nations that are around thee, in the sight of all that pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, an instruction and an horror to the nations that are around thee, when I shall execute judgments in thee in anger and in fury and in furious rebukes. I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>When I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine, which shall be for their destruction, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>So will I send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee; and pestilence and blood shall pass through thee; and I will bring the sword upon thee. I the LORD have spoken it.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.6'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.1'>And the word of the LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.2'>Son of man, set thy face toward the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.3'>And say, Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord GOD; Thus saith the Lord GOD to the mountains, and to the hills, to the rivers, and to the valleys; Behold, I, even I, will bring a sword upon you, and I will destroy your high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.4'>And your altars shall be desolate, and your images shall be broken: and I will cast down your slain men before your idols. <note>images: or, sun images</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.5'>And I will lay the dead bodies of the children of Israel before their idols; and I will scatter your bones about your altars. <note>lay: Heb. give</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.6'>In all your dwellingplaces the cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be desolate; that your altars may be laid waste and made desolate, and your idols may be broken and cease, and your images may be cut down, and your works may be abolished. <note>images: or, sun images</note></verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.7'>And the slain shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.8'>Yet will I leave a remnant, that ye may have some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when ye shall be scattered through the countries.</verse>
