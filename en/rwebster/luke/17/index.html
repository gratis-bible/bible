I think not.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="10">10</a>So likewise ye, when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded to you, say, We are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was our duty to do.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="11">11</a>And it came to pass, as he went to Jerusalem, that he passed through the midst of Samaria and Galilee.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="12">12</a>And as he entered into a certain village, there met him ten men that were lepers, who stood afar off:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="13">13</a>And they lifted up their voices, and said, Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="14">14</a>And when he saw them, he said to them, Go show yourselves to the priests. And it came to pass, that, as they were going, they were cleansed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="15">15</a>And one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, and with a loud voice glorified God,</span> <span class="verse"><a name="16">16</a>And fell down on his face at his feet, giving him thanks: and he was a Samaritan.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="17">17</a>And Jesus answering said, Were there not ten cleansed? but where are the nine?</span> <span class="verse"><a name="18">18</a>There are not found returning to give glory to God, except this stranger.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="19">19</a>And he said to him, Arise, go thy way: thy faith hath made thee well.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="20">20</a>And when he was asked by the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not with observation:</span> <span class="verse"><a name="21">21</a>Neither shall they say, Lo here! or, lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God is within you.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="22">22</a>And he said to his disciples, The days will come, when ye shall desire to see one of the days of the Son of man, and ye shall not see it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="23">23</a>And they shall say to you, See here; or, see there: go not after them, nor follow them.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="24">24</a>For as the lightning, that lighteneth from the one part under heaven, shineth to the other part under heaven; so shall also the Son of man be in his day.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="25">25</a>But first he must suffer many things, and be rejected by this generation.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="26">26</a>And as it was in the days of Noah, so shall it be also in the days of the Son of man.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="27">27</a>They ate, they drank, they married wives, they were given in marriage, until the day that Noah entered into the ark, and the flood came, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="28">28</a>Likewise also as it was in the days of Lot; they ate, they drank, they bought, they sold, they planted, they built;</span> <span class="verse"><a name="29">29</a>But the same day that Lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven, and destroyed them all.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="30">30</a>Even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of man is revealed.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="31">31</a>In that day, he who shall be upon the housetop, and his furniture in the house, let him not come down to take it away: and he that is in the field, let him likewise not return back.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="32">32</a>Remember Lot’s wife.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="33">33</a>Whoever shall seek to save his life shall lose it; and whoever shall lose his life shall preserve it.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="34">34</a>I tell you, in that night there shall be two men in one bed; the one shall be taken, and the other shall be left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="35">35</a>Two women shall be grinding together; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="36">36</a>Two men shall be in the field; the one shall be taken, and the other left.</span> <span class="verse"><a name="37">37</a>And they answered and said to him, Where, Lord? And he said to them, Wherever the body is, there will the eagles be gathered together.</span> </p></div</div></div></body></html>
