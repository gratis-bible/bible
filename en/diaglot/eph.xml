The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I exhort therefore you, I the prisoner in Lord, worthily to walk of the calling with which you were called,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>so that no longer we may be babes, being tossed and being whirled about with every wind of the teachings, in the trickery of the men, by cunning with the method of the deceit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>being truthful but in love, we may grow into him the all things, who is the head, the Anointed;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>This then I say, and testify in Lord, no longer you to walk, as also the others Gentiles walks in vanity of the mind of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>having been darkened in the understanding, being alienated from the life of the God, through the ignorance that being in them, through the stupidity of the heart of them; Ephesians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>who having become callous, themselves gave over to the lewdness for a work of impurity all with eagerness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>You but not thus learned the Anointed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if indeed him you heard and by him were taught, as is truth in the Jesus; Ephesians</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and be you clothed with the new man, that according to God having been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>Therefore putting away the falsehood, speak you truth, each one with the neighbor of himself; because we are of each other members.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be you angry and not do you sin; the sun not let it set on the wrath of you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>not even give you a place for the accuser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>The one stealing no longer let him steal, rather but let him toil working the good thing with the hands, so that he may have to give to the one want having.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Every word rotten out of the mouth of you not let go forth, but, if anything good for a building up of the use, that it may give benefit to those hearing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>and not grieve you the spirit the holy of the God, by which you were sealed for a day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>All bitterness and anger and wrath and clamor and evilspeaking let be taken from you, with all malice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>become you and towards each other kind ones, tender hearted ones, showing favor to others, even as also the God in Anointed showed favor to you.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Become you therefore imitators of the God, as children beloved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>walk you in love, even as also the Anointed loved us, and delivered up himself on behalf of us an offering and a sacrifice, to the God for an odor of a sweet smell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>Fornication but and all impurity or unbridled lust not even let it be named among you, (as it becomes holy ones,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>also indecency, and foolish talking or loose jesting, the things not becoming; but rather thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>This for you know knowing, that every fornicator or impure person or lascivious person, who is an idol worshipper, not has an inheritance in the kingdom of the Anointed one and of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>No one you let deceive with empty words; on account of these things for comes the wrath of the God on the sons of the disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Not therefore become you associates of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>You were indeed once darkness, now but light in Lord; as children of light walk you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>(the for fruit of the light in all goodness and truth;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>searching out what is wellpleasing to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>and not be you jointpartakers with the works with those unfruitful of the darkness, rather but even do you reprove.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>The things for in secret being done by them, indecent it is even to say.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>The but all things, being exposed by the light, are manifested; every thing for that is being manifested, light is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Therefore it says: Awake thou the one sleeping, and arise thou out of the dead ones, and will shine on thee the Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See you then, how accurately you walk; not as unwise ones, but as wise ones;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>buying for yourselves the season, because the days evil are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>Because of this not become you simple ones, but understanding what the will of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And not be you drunk with wine, in which is profligacy, but be you filled with spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>speaking yourselves in psalms and hymns and songs spiritual singing and making music in the heart of you to the Lord;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>giving thanks at all times on behalf of all, in name the Lord of us Jesus Anointed, to the God and Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>submitting yourselves to each other in fear of Anointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>the wives to the own husbands be you submissive, as to the Lord; Ephesians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>because a husband is a head of the wife, as even the Anointed a head of the congregation; he is a preserver of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But even as the congregation is subjected to the Anointed, thus also the wives to the own husbands in everything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>The husbands, love you the wives of yourselves, even as also the Anointed loved the congregation, and himself delivered up on behalf of her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>so that her he might sanctify, having cleansed in the bath of the water by a word; Ephesians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>that might place beside he himself glorious the congregation, not having a spot or blemish or any of such like things, but that she might be holy and blameless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>Thus are obligated the husbands to love the of themselves wives, as the of themselves bodies. He loving the of himself wife, himself loves;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>no one for ever the of himself flesh hated, but nourishes and cherishes her; as even the Anointed the congregation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>because members we are of the body of him, out of the flesh of him, and out of the bones of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>On account of this shall leave a man the father of himself and the mother, and shall be closely joined to the wife of himself, and will be the two into flesh one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>The secret this great is; I but speak about Anointed, and about the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>But also you the every one, each one the of himself wife thus let love as himself; the and wife so that she may reverence the husband.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>Put you on the complete armor of the God, for that to enable you to stand against the crafty ways of the accuser;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>because not is to us the comfort with blood and flesh, but with the governments, with the authorities, with the worldrulers of the darkness of this, with the spiritual things of the evil one, in the heavenlies.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>and having shod the feet with a preparation of the glad tidings of the peace; Ephesians</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>besides all having taken up the shield of the faith, by which you will be able all the darts of the evil one the having been kindled to quench;</verse>
