The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.7'>knowing, that as partakers you are of the sufferings, so also of the comfort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.8'>Not for we wish to be ignorant, brethren, concerning the affliction of us of that happening to us in the Asia, that according to excess we were pressed above strength, so that to be in despair us even of the life;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.9'>but ourselves in ourselves the sentence of the death we have, so that not having trusted we should in ourselves, but in the God that one raising up the dead ones;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.11'>cooperating also you on behalf of us in the prayer, that from many faces the for us gift through many might be given thanks on behalf of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.12'>The for boasting of us this is, the testimony of the conscience of us, that in simplicity and sincerity of God, (not in wisdom fleshly, but in favor of God) we conducted in the world, more abundantly but to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.13'>Not for other things we write to you, but what you read, or what you acknowledge; I hope and, that even till end you will acknowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.1.14'>as also you acknowledged us from parts; because a boasting of you we are, even as also you of us, in the day of the Lord Jesus.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.2'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.1'>I decided but with myself this, that not again in grief to you to come.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.3'>And I wrote to you this same thing, so that not having come grief I have from of whom it behooves me rejoice; having confided in all you, that the my joy of all of you it is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.4'>Out of for much affliction and anguish of heart I wrote to you through many tears, not that you might be grieved, but the love that you might know, which I have more abundantly towards you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.5'>If but any one has been grieved, not me he has grieved, but from parts, that not I may bear hard upon, all you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.6'>Sufficient to the such one the censure this which by the majority;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.7'>so that on the other hand rather you to freely forgive and to comfort, lest by the more abundant grief should be swallowed the such one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.8'>Wherefore I entreat you to publicly confirm to him love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.9'>In order to this for also I wrote, so that I might know the proof of you, if to all things obedient you are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.10'>To whom but anything you freely forgive, also I; even for I what have freely forgiven, if anything I have freely forgiven, on account of you, in presence of Anointed;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.11'>that not we should be overreached by the adversary; not for of him the devices we are ignorant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.12'>Having come but to the Troas for the glad tidings of the Anointed, and a door to me having been opened by Lord, not I had rest in the spirit of me, by the not to come me Titus the brother of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.13'>but having bade farewell to them, I went out into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.14'>To the but God thanks to that always leading to triumph us in the Anointed, and the order of the knowledge of himself is manifesting through us in every place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.15'>That of Anointed a sweet order we are to the God in those being saved and in those perishing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.16'>to them indeed an order of death into death; to those but, an order of life into life. And for these things who sufficient?</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.2.17'>Not for we are like the many, adulterating the word of the God; but as from sincerity, but as from God, in presence of the God, in Anointed we speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='2Cor.3'>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.1'>Do we begin again ourselves to commend? or not we need, as some, of recommendation letters to you or from you of recommendation?</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.3'>being manifest, that you are a letter of Anointed having been ministered by us, having been written not with ink, but by spirit of God living, not on tablets of stones, but on tablets of hearts fleshly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.4'>Confidence but such we have through the Anointed towards the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.5'>not because sufficient we are from ourselves, to reason anything, as from ourselves, but the sufficiency of us from of the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.6'>who also qualified us servants of a new covenant, not of letter, but of spirit; the for letter kills, the but spirit gives life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.7'>If but the service of the death in letters, having been engraved in stone, was made in glory, so that not to be able to look steadily the sons of Israel into the face of Moses, on account of the glory of the face of him, that passing away;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.8'>how not rather the service of the spirit shall be in glory;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.12'>Having therefore such a hope, much freedom we use;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.3.13'>and not, as Moses placed a veil on the face of himself, for the not to gaze intently the sons of Israel to the end of that passing away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.3'>but even it is having been veiled the glad tidings of us, among those being destroyed it is having been veiled;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Cor.4.4'>in whom the God of the age this blinded the minds of the unbelieving ones, in order that not to see distinctly the illumination of the glad tidings of the glory of the Anointed one, who is an image of the God.</verse>
