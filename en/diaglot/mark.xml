The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

  <div type='book' osisID='Mark'>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>A beginning of the glad tidings of Jesus Anointed, a son of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in Esaias the prophet: Lo, I send the messenger of me before face of thee, who will prepare the way of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>A voice crying out in the desert; Make you ready the way of a lord, straight make you the beaten ways of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>Was John dipping in the desert, and publishing a dipping of reformation into forgiveness of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And went out to him all the Judea country, and the Jerusalem all; and were dipped in the Jordan river by him, confessing the sins of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>Was now John having been clothed hairs of a camel, and a belt made of skin around the loins of him, and eating locusts and honey wild.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he cried out saying: Comes the mightier of me after me, of whom not I am worthy bowed down to loose the string of the sandals of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I indeed dipped you in water; he but will dip you in spirit holy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it came to pass in those the days, came Jesus from Nazareth of the Galilee, and was dipped by John into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And immediately ascending from the water, he saw rending the heavens, and the spirit, as a dove, descending upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And a voice came out of the heavens: Thou art the son of me the beloved in whom I delight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the spirit him casts into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was in the desert days forty, being tempted by the adversary, and was with the wild beasts; and the messengers ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>After now the to be delivered up the John, came the Jesus into the Galilee, preaching the glad tidings of the kingdom of the God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>and saying: That has been fulfilled the season, and has come nigh the majesty of the God; reform you, and believe you in the good message.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>Walking and by the sea of the Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of him, casting a fishing net in the sea; they were for fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And said to them the Jesus: Come after me, and I will make you to be fishers of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And immediately leaving the nets of them, they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And going thence a little, he saw James the of the Zebedee, and John the brother of him, and themselves in the ship were mending the nets;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>and immediately he called them. And leaving the father of them Zebedee in the ship with the hirelings, they went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And they went into Capernaum; and immediately to the sabbath going into the synagogue, he taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they were amazed at the teaching of him; he was for teaching them as authority having, and not as the scribes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And was in the synagogue of them a man in spirit unclean, and he cried out,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>saying: Let alone, what to us and to thee, Jesus O Nazarene, comet thou to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the holy of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And rebuked him the Jesus, saying: Be silent, and come out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And convulsing him the spirit the unclean, and crying a voice great, came out of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And they were astonished all, so as to reason among themselves, saying: What is this? what the teaching the new this? that with authority even to the spirits to the unclean he enjoins and they harken to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>Went out and the report of him forthwith into whole the country of the Galilee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And instantly, out of the synagogue being come, he went into the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>The and motherinlaw of Simon was laid down having a fever; and immediately they spoke to him about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And coming he raised her, having laid hold of the hand of her; and left her the fever immediately; and ministered to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Evening and being come, when set the sun, they brought to him all those sickness having, and those being demonized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>and the city whole having been assembled was at the door.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>And he healed many sick having various diseases; and demons many cast out, and not allowed to speak the demons, because they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>And early, night much, having arisen he went out, and depart into a desert place, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And eagerly followed him the Simon and those with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>And having found him, they say to him: That all seek thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>And he says to them: We must go into the neighboring towns, that also there I may preach; for this because I have come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he was proclaiming in the synagogues of the, in whole the Galilee, and the demons casting out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And comes to a leper, beseeching him and kneeling him, and saying to him: That if thou wilt, thou art able me to cleanse.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>The and Jesus being moved with pity, stretching out the hand, touched of him, and says to him; I will, be thou cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And having said of him, immediately departed from him the leprosy, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And having strictly charged him, immediately he sent forth him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and says to him: See, to no one anything thou tell; but go, thyself show to the priest, and offer for the purification of thee what enjoined Moses, for a witness to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>He but going out began to publish many (things) and spread abroad the word, so as no longer him to be able publicly into a city to enter; but without in desert place he was, and they went to him from all parts.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>And again he went into Capernaum after days; and it was reported, that into a house he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>And immediately were gathered together many, so as no longer to contain not even the places near the door; and he spake to them the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they come to him a paralytic bringing, being carried by four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And not being able to come nigh to him through the crowd, they uncovered the roof, where he was; and having dug through they let down the bed upon which the paralytic was laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>Seeing and the Jesus the faith of them, says to the paralytic: Son, are forgiven of thee the sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>Were but some of the scribes there sitting and reasoning in the hearts of them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Why this thus speaks blasphemy? Who is able to forgive sins, if not one the God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>And immediately knowing the Jesus to the spirit of himself, that thus they reasoned among themselves, said to them: Why these (things) reason you in the hearts of you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier? to say to the paralytic: Are forgiven of thee the sins? or to say: Arise, take up of thee the bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>That but you may know, that authority has the son of the man on the earth to forgive sins; (he says to the paralytic:)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>To thee I say: Arise, take up the bed of thee, and go into the house of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he was raised immediately, and taking up the bed, went out in presence of all; so as to astonish all, and to glorify the God, saying: That never thus we saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>And he went out again by the sea; and all the crowds came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And passing on he saw Levi the of the Alpheus, sitting at the custom house, and says to him: Follow me. And arising up he followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And it happened in the to recline at table him in the house of him, and many publicans and sinners reclined with the Jesus and the disciples of him; they were for many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the scribes and the Pharisees seeing him eating with the publicans and sinners, said to the disciples of him: Why that with of the publicans and sinners he eats and drinks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>And hearing the Jesus says to them: No need have those being well of a physician, but those sick being. Not I came to call just (ones) but sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>And were the disciples of John and the Pharisees fasting; and they come, and they say to him: Why the disciples of John and those of the Pharisees fast; those but to thee disciples not fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>And said to them the Jesus: Not are able the sons of the bridechamber, in which the bridegroom with them is, to fast? so long a time with themselves they have the bridegroom, not are able to fast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>Will come but days, when may be taken away from them the bridegroom, and then they will fast in that the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No one a patch of cloth unfulled sews on to a mantle old; if but not, takes away the patch of itself the new of the old, and worse a rent becomes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no one puts wine new into bottles old; if but not, bursts the wine the new the bottles, and the wine is spilled, and the bottles are lost; but wine new into bottles new must be put.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>And it came to pass to go him in the sabbath through the cornfields, and began the disciples of him a way to make plucking the ears of corn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharisees said to him: See, why do they in the sabbath, what not is lawful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>And he said to them: Never have you known, what did David, when need he had, and was hungry, he and those with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>How he went into the house of the God, to Abiathar of the highpriest, and the loaves of the presence did eat, which not is lawful to eat if not the priests, and he gave also to those with him being?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them: The sabbath because of the man was made, not the man because of the sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>So that a lord is the son of the man even of the sabbath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And he entered again into the synagogue; and was there man having been withered having the hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>and they closely watched him, if to the sabbath he will heal him, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he says to the man to that having been withered having the hand: Arise in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>And he says to them: Is it lawful to the sabbath to do good or to do evil? a life to save, or to destroy? They but were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And looking round them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of the hearts of them, he says to the man: Stretch out the hand of thee. And he stretched it out; and was restored the hand of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And coming out the Pharisees, immediately with the Herodians a council held against him, how him they might destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And the Jesus with the disciples of him withdrew to the sea; and a great multitude from the Galilee followed him; and from the Judea, and from Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from the Idumea, and beyond the Jordan, and those about Tyre and Sidon, a multitude great, having heard what things he did, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spake to the disciples of him, that a small vessel should attend him, because of the crowd, that not they might throng him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>Many for he cured, so as to rush to him, that him they might touch, as many as had scourges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And the spirits the unclean, when him gazing on, fell before him, and cried, saying: That thou art the son of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And many times he charged them, that not known him they should make.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>And he goes up into the mountain, and calls whom would he; and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he appointed twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to cure the diseases, and to cast out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he put on to the Simon a name Peter;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and James that of the Zebedee, and John the brother of the James; and he put on them names Boanerges, that is, sons of thunder;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>and Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James that of the Alpheus, and Thaddeus, and the Simon the Canaanite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Judas Iscariot, who even delivered up him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And they come into a house. And came together again a crowd, so as not to be able them not even bread to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And having heard those with him, went out to restrain him; they said for: That he is out of place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the scribes, those from Jerusalem having come down, said: That Beelzebul he has; also; That by the chief of the demons he casts out the demons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And having called them, in parables he said to them: How is able an adversary and adversary to cast out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>And if a kingdom against herself should be divided, not able to stand the kingdom that;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>and if a house against herself should be divided, not able to stand the house that;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>and if the adversary has risen up against himself and has been divided, not able to stand, but an end he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one is able the household goods of the strong man, entering into the house of him, to plunder, if not first the strong man he should bind; and then the house of him he will plunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Indeed I say to you, that all will be forgiven to the sons of the men the sins, and the evil speakings, whatever they may revile;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>who but ever may speak evil to the spirit the holy, not has forgiveness to the age, but liable is of agelasting judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Because they said: A spirit unclean he has.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>Comes then the mother of him and the brothers of him; and without standing they sent to him, calling him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>And sat a crowd about him; said and to him: Lo, the mother of thee and the brothers of thee without are seeking thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered to them, saying: Who is the mother of me, or the brothers of me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking about round those about him sitting, he says: Lo the mother of me, and the brothers of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>Who for ever may do the will of the God, this a brother of me, and a sister of me and a mother is.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And again he began to teach by the sea; and was assembled to him a crowd great, so as him entering into the ship, to sit in the sea; and all the crowd by the sea on the land was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he taught them in parables many, and said to them in the teaching of him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Hear you: Lo, went out the sower of the (seed) to sow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>And it happened in the sowing, this indeed fell on the path; and came the birds, and ate it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>Another and fell on the rocky ground, where not it had earth much; and immediately it sprung up, through the not to have a depth of earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>Sun and having arisen, it was scorched, and through the not to have a root, was dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And another fell into thorns; and sprung up the thorns, and chocked it, and fruit not it gave.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>And another fell into the ground the good; and it bore fruit springing up and increasing; and bore one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said: He having ear to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>When and he was alone, asked him those about him, with the twelve, the parables.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And he said to them: To you it is given to know the secret of the kingdom of the God; to them but to those without in parables the all (things) are done;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that seeing they may see, and not they may see; and hearing they may hear, and not they may hear; lest they should turn, and should be forgiven to them the sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he says to them: Nat know you the parable this? and how all the parables will you know?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>He sowing, the word sows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>These and are they by the path, where is sown the word, and when they may hear, immediately comes the adversary, and takes the word that having been sown in the hearts of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these are like those on the rocky ground being sown, who, when they may hear the word, immediately with joy they receive it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>and not they have a root in themselves, but for a reason they are; then occurring trial or persecution through the word, immediately they are offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And others are those into the thorns, being sown; these are those the word hearing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the cares of the age, and the delusion of the wealth, and the about the other (things) strong desires entering in choke the word; and unfruitful it becomes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these are those upon the ground the good being sown, who hear the word, and accept; and bear fruit, one thirty, and one sixty, and one a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them: Neither the lamp comes, that under the measure it may be placed, or under the couch? not that on the lampstand it may be placed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>Not for is any thing hidden, which if not it may be disclosed; nor was stored away, but that into light it may come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any one has ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>And he said to them: Consider you, what you hear. In what measure you measure, it shall be measured to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>Who for ever may have, it shall be given to him; and who not has, even what he has will be taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said: Thus is the kingdom of the God, as if a man should cast the seed on the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and should sleep and wake night and day, and the seed should germinate and grow up, as not knows he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>Of its own accord for the earth bears fruit, first, a plant, then an ear, then full grain in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>When but may be ripe the fruit, immediately he sends the sickle, for is ready the harvest.</verse>
