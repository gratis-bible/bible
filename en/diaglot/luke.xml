The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='Luke.20.1'>And it happened in one of the days those was teaching of him the people in the temple, and preaching glad tidings, stood by the highpriests and the scribes with the elders,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.2'>and said to him, saying: Say to us, by what authority these things doest you? or who is he having given to thee the authority this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.3'>Answering and he said to them: Will ask you also I one word, and say you to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.4'>The dipping of John from heaven was, or from men?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.5'>They and reasoned among themselves, saying: That if we would say: From heaven he will say: Why then not did you believe him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.6'>If and we should say: From men; all the people will stone us; having been persuaded for it is, John a prophet to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.7'>And they answered not to have known whence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.8'>And the Jesus said to them: Neither I tell to you, by what authority these I do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.9'>He began and to the people to say the parable this: A man planted a vineyard and let out it to husbandmen; and went abroad times many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.10'>And in season he sent to the husbandmen a slave, that from of the fruit of the vineyard they might give to him; the but husbandmen, having beaten him, sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.11'>And he proceeded to send another slave; they but also this having beaten and having dishonored, sent away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.12'>And he proceeded to send a third; they but also this having wounded cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.13'>Said and the lord of the vineyard: What shall I do? I will send the son of me the beloved; perhaps this seeing they will regard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.14'>Seeing but him the husbandmen, they reasoned with themselves, saying: This is the heir; come, we may kill him, that to us may be the inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.15'>And casting him out of the vineyard, they killed. What then will do to them the lord of the vineyard?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.16'>He will come and will destroy these husbandmen those, and give the vineyard to others. Having heard and they said: Not let it be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.17'>He but, having looked to them, he said: What then is that having been written this: A stone which rejected of builders, this has been made into a head corner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.18'>All the falling upon that the stone, will be bruised; on whom but it may fall, will grind to power him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.19'>And sought the highpriests and the scribes to put on him the hands in this the hour; but they feared the people; they knew for, that to them the parable this he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.20'>And having watched they sent spies, feigning themselves righteous to be; that they might lay hold of him of a word, in order to the to deliver up him to the rule and to the authority of the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.21'>And they asked him, saying: O teacher, we know, that rightly thou speakest and thou teachest, and not thou dost accept a countenance, but in truth the way of the God thou teachest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.22'>Is it lawful for us to Caesar tax to give, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.23'>Perceiving but to them the craftiness, he said to them: Why me tempt you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.24'>Show you to me a denarius; of whom has it a likeness and inscription? Answering and they said: Of Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.25'>He and said to them: Give you back then the things of Caesar, to Caesar; and the things of the God, to the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.26'>And not they were able to take hold of him of a word in presence of the people; and wondering at the answer of him, they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.27'>Approaching and some of the Sadducees, those denying a resurrection not to be, asked him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.28'>saying: O teacher, Moses wrote for us, If any one a brother should die having a wife, and this childless should die, that should take the brother of him the wife, and should raise up seed to the brother of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.29'>Seven now brothers were; and the first having taken a wife, died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.30'>And took the second the wife, and this died childless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.31'>And the third took her; in like manner and also the seven; not they left children, and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.32'>Last and of all died also the woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.33'>In the therefore resurrection, of which of them will be a wife? the for seven had her a wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.34'>And answering he said to them the Jesus: The sons of the age this marry and are given marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.35'>those but having been accounted worthy of the age that to obtain, and of the resurrection that out of dead ones, neither marry, nor are given in marriage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.36'>nor for to die more are able; like angels for they are, and sons they are of the God, of the resurrection sons being.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.37'>That but rise the dead ones, even Moses declared at the bush, when he calls a Lord, the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.38'>A God now not he is of dead ones, but of living ones; all for to him live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.39'>Answering and some of the scribes said: O teacher, well thou hast spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.40'>No longer and they presumed to ask him nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.41'>He said and to them: How say they the Anointed a son of David to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.42'>And yet himself David says in a book of psalms: Said the Lord to the lord of me:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.43'>Sit thou at right hand of me till I may place the enemies of thee a footstool of the feet of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.44'>David therefore a lord him calls, and how a son of him is he?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.45'>Hearing and all of the people, he said to the disciples of himself:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.46'>Beware of the scribes, those wishing to walk in robes, and loving salutations in the markets, and first seats in the synagogues, and first places in the feasts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.20.47'>they devour the houses of the widows, and for a show long they pray; the so will receive greater judgment.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Luke.21'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.1'>Looking and he saw those casting the gifts of them into the treasury rich ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.2'>He saw and also a certain widow poor casting there two lepta;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.3'>and he said: Truly I say to you, that the widow that poor this more of all has cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.4'>All for they out of the abundance of them cast into the gifts of the God; she but out of the want of herself all the living, which she had, she cast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.5'>And some speaking about the temple that with stones beautiful and offerings it was adorned, he said:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.6'>These which you behold, will come days in which not will be left a stone upon a stone, which not will be thrown down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.7'>They asked and him, saying: O teacher, when then these will be? and what the sign, when may be about these to be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.8'>He but said: Look you, not you may be deceived. Many for will come in the name of me, saying: That I am, and the season has approached. Not therefore go you after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.9'>When and you may hear of wars and commotions, not you may be terrified, must for these come to pass first; but not immediately the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.10'>Then he said to them: Will rise a nation on a nation, and a kingdom on a kingdom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.11'>earthquakes and great in many places, and famines, and pestilences will be; fearful sights also and signs from heaven great will be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.12'>Before but this all they will lay on you the hands of them, and they will persecute, delivering up to synagogues and prisons, dragging to kings and governors, on account of the name of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.13'>It will turn out and to you for a testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.14'>Settle therefore in the hearts of you, not to premeditate to make a defence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.15'>I for will give to you a mouth and wisdom, which not will be able to gainsay or resist all the opponents to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.16'>You will be delivered up and also by parents, and brothers, and relatives, and friends; and they will put to death of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.17'>And you will be being hated by all through the name of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.18'>And a hair from the head of you not not will perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.19'>In the patient endurance of you preserve you the lives of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.20'>When and you may see surrounded by encampments the Jerusalem, then you may know, that has come near the desolation of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.21'>Then those in the Judea, let them flee to the mountains; and those in midst of her, let them go out; and those in the country places, not let them enter into her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.22'>For days of vengeance these are, of the to be fulfilled all the things having been written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.23'>Woe but to the in womb holding and to the giving suck in those the days; will be for distress great upon the land, and wrath to the people this;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.24'>and they will fall by edge of a sword, and they will be led captive into all the nations; and Jerusalem will be trodden down by Gentiles, till may be fulfilled seasons of Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.25'>And will be signs in sun and moon and stars; and on the earth anguish of nations in perplexity of a roar of sea and of tossing;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.26'>fainting men from fear and expectation of the things coming on the habitable; the for powers of the heavens will be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.27'>And then they will see the son of the man coming in a cloud, with power and glory great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.28'>Beginning and of these to occur, raise yourselves and lift up the heads of you; because draws near the deliverance of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.29'>And he spoke a parable to them: See you the figtree and all the trees;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.30'>when they shoot forth now, beholding, from of yourselves you know, that now near the summer is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.31'>So also you, when you may see these occurring, know you, that near is the kingdom of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.32'>Indeed I say to you, that not not may pass away the generation this, till all may be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.33'>The heaven and the earth shall pass away; the but words of me not not may pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.34'>Take heed but to yourselves, lest should be burdened of you the hearts with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and anxieties of life; and suddenly on you may come the day that.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.35'>As a snare for it will come on all those dwelling on face of all of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.36'>Watch you then in every season, praying, that you may be accounted worthy to escape these all the things being about to occur, and to stand in presence of the son of the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.37'>He was and the days in the temple teaching; the and nights going out he lodged in the mountain that being called of olive trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.21.38'>And all the people came early to him in the temple to hear him.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Luke.22'>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.1'>Drew near now the feast of the unleavened cakes, that being called passover;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.2'>and sought the highpriests and the scribes, the how they might kill him; they feared for the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.3'>Entered and adversary into Judas that being surnamed Iscariot, being of the number of the twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.4'>And going he talked with the highpriests and the officers, the how him he might deliver up to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.5'>And they were glad; and agreed to him silver to give.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.6'>And he consented; and he sought opportunity of the to deliver up him to them without of a crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.7'>Came and the day of the unleavened cakes, in which it is necessary to sacrifice the paschal lamb;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.8'>and he sent Peter and John, saying: Going prepare you for us the passover, that we may eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.9'>They and said to him: Where wilt thou we make ready?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.10'>He and said to them: Lo, having entered of you into the city, will meet you a man a pitcher of water carrying; follow you him into the house, where he enters; and say you to the householder of the house:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.11'>Says to thee the teacher: Where is the greatchamber, where the passover with the disciples of me I may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.12'>And he to you will show an upper room large having been furnished; there prepare you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.13'>Having gone and they found even as he had said to them; and they prepared the passover.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.14'>And when came the hour, he reclined, and the twelve apostles with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.15'>And he said to them: With desire I have desired this the passover to eat with you, before the me to suffer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.16'>I say for to you, that no more not not I may eat it, till it may be fulfilled in the kingdom of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.17'>And having taken a cup, having given thanks he said: Take you this, and divide you among yourselves.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.19'>And having taken a loaf, having given thanks he broke, and gave to them, saying: This is the body of me, that in behalf of you being given; this do you in the my remembrance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.21'>But lo, the hand of the delivering up me with mine on the table.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.22'>And the indeed son of the man goes away according to that having been appointed; but woe to the man that, through whom he is delivered up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.23'>And they began to inquire among themselves, the, which then it could be of them the this being about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.24'>There had been and also a strife among them, the, which of them thinks to be greater.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.26'>You but not so; but the greater among you, let him become as the younger; and the governor, as he serving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.27'>Which for greater? he reclining, or he serving? not he reclining? I but am in the midst of you as he serving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.28'>You but are those having continued with me in the trials of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.29'>And I covenant for you, even as has covenanted for me the Father of me a kingdom,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.31'>Said and the Lord: Simon, Simon, lo, the adversary has asked for you, the to sift as the wheat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.32'>I but prayed for thee, that not may fail the faith of thee. And thou when having been turned, strengthen the brethren of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.33'>He and said to him: O lord, with thee ready I am both to prison and to death to go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.34'>He but said: I say to thee, O Peter, not not will crow today a cock, before thrice thou wilt deny not to have known me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.35'>And he said to them: When I sent you without a purse, and a bag, and sandals, not anything wanted you? They and said; Nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.36'>He said then to them: But now, he having a purse, let him take, in like manner and a bag; and he not having, let him sell the mantle of himself, and let him buy a sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.37'>I say for to you, that yet this the having been written must to be finished in me, that: And with lawbreakers he was counted. Also for the things about me an end has.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.40'>Having come and to the place, he said to them: Pray you not to enter into temptation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.41'>And he was withdrawn from them about of a stone throw, and having placed the knees he prayed, saying:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.42'>O Father if thou art willing to take away the cup this from me; but not the will of me, but the thine be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.43'>Appeared and to him a messenger from heaven, strengthening him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.44'>And being in agony, very earnestly he prayed. Was and the sweat of him like clots of blood falling down to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.45'>And having stood up from the prayer, coming to the disciples, he found them sleeping from the grief; and he said to them:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.47'>While and of him speaking, lo, a crowd, and he being called Judas, one of the twelve, went before them, and drew near to the Jesus to kiss him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.22.52'>Said and the Jesus to those having come on him highpriests, and offices of the temple, and elders: As on a robber you have come out with swords and clubs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.53'>every day being of me with you in the temple, not you did stretch out the hands on me; but this of you it is the hour, and the authority of the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.22.54'>Having seized and him they led, and brought him into the house of the highpriest. The but Peter followed at a distance.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Luke.24.36'>These and of them speaking, he stood in midst of them, and says to them: Peace to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Luke.24.37'>Being terrified but and affrighted having become they thought a spirit to see.</verse>
