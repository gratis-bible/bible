The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.6'>Through which cause I remind thee to kindle up the free gift of the God, which is in thee through the putting on of the hands of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.7'>not for gave to us the God a spirit of timidity, but of power and of love and of a sound mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.8'>Not therefore thou mayest be ashamed of the testimony of the Lord of us, nor me the prisoner of him; but participate in suffering evil for the glad tidings according to power of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.9'>of the one having saved us and having called with a calling holy, not according to the works of us, but according to own purpose and favor that having been given to us in Anointed Jesus before times agelasting,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.10'>having been manifested but now through the appearance of the savior of us Jesus Anointed, having rendered powerless indeed the death, having illuminated but life and incorruptibility by means of the glad tidings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.11'>for which was appointed I a herald and an apostle and a teacher of nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.12'>through which cause also these things I suffer, but not I am ashamed; I know for in whom I have believed, and I have confided in, because powerful he is the trust of me to guard to that the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.1.13'>An outline hold thou of sound words, of which from me thou didst hear, in faith and love in that in Anointed Jesus;</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.7'>Consider thou, the things I say; may give for to thee the Lord understanding in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.8'>Do thou remember Jesus Anointed having been raised out of dead ones, from seed of David, according to the glad tidings of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.9'>in which I suffer evil even to chains, as an evil doer; but the word of the God not is chained.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.13'>if faithless, he faithful remains; to deny himself not he is able.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.14'>These things do thou put in mind, earnestly testifying in presence of the Lord, not to dispute about words, for nothing useful, to a subversion of those hearing.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.17'>and the word of them as a mortifying sore pasture will have; of whom is Hymenius and Philetus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.18'>who concerning the truth missed the mark, saying the resurrection already to have happened, and overturn the of some faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.19'>The however firm foundation of the God stands, having the zeal this: Knew Lord the being of himself; and: Let depart from injustice every one who is naming the name of Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.20'>In great but a house not is only vessels golden and made of silver, but also wooden and earthen; and some indeed for honor, some and for dishonor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.21'>If therefore any one should well cleanse himself from these, he will be a vessel for honor, having been cleansed, and of good use to the master, for every work good having been prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.22'>The now youthful desires flee thou; pursue thou but righteousness, faith, love, peace with those calling on the Lord out of pure a heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.23'>The but foolish and uninstructive questions do thou avoid, knowing, that they beget contests;</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.24'>a bondman but of lord not it behooves to quarrel, but gentle to be to all, fit to teach, enduring evil,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.25'>in meekness admonishing those being opposed; perhaps may give to them the God a change of mind to a knowledge of truth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='2Tim.2.26'>and they may be recovered from the of the accuser snare having been taken alive by him for the of him will.</verse>

        <verse osisID='2Tim.3.8'>Which way but Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so also these are opposed to the truth, men having corrupted the mind, disapproved ones concerning the faith.</verse>
