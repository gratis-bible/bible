The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>A revelation of Jesus Anointed, which gave to him the God, to point out to the bondservants of himself the things it behooves to have done with speed, and he signified having sent by means of the messenger of himself to the bondservant of himself to John;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified the word of the God, and the testimony of Jesus Anointed, what things he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed the one reading, and those hearing the words of the prophecy, and keeping strictly the things in it having been written; the for season near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John to the seven congregations to those in the Asia; favor to you and peace from the one existing and the one who was and the one coming; and from the seven spirits, which is in presence of the throne of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Anointed, the witness the faithful, the firstborn of the deadones, and the prince of the kings of the earth; to the one loving us and having washed us from the sins of us in the blood of himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and made us a kingdom, priests to the God and Father of himself, to him the glory and the strength for the ages of the ages; so be it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Lo, he comes with the clouds, and shall see him every eye, and those who him pierced; and shall mourn over him all the tribes of the earth; yes, so be it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, says Lord the God, the one existing and the one who was and the one coming, the almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, the brother of you, and copartner in the affliction and kingdom and patience of Jesus Anointed, was in the island that being call Patmos, on account of the word of the God, and on account of the testimony of Jesus Anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in spirit in the Lords day; and I heard behind of me a voice loud as of a trumpet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying: What thou seest do thou write for a scroll, and send to the seven congregations, to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice which spoke with me; and having turned I saw seven lampstands golden,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>and in midst of the seven lampstands like to a son of man, having on a garment reaching to the foot, and having been girded about at the breasts a girdle golden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>the but head of him and the hairs, white as wool white, as snow; and the eyes of him as a flame of fire;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and the feet of him like to fine white brass, as in a furnace having been set on fire; and the voice of him as a vice of waters many;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>and having in the right of himself hand stars seven; and out of the mouth of him a broad sword twomouthed sharp proceeding; and the appearance of him, as the sun shines in the power of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him I fell at the feet of him, as dead; and he placed the right of himself on me, saying: Not do thou fear; I am the first and the last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and the living one; even I was dead, and lo living I am for the ages of the ages; and I have the keys of the death and of the unseen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write thou therefore the things thou sawest, even the things are, and the things about to occur after these;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>the secret of the seven stars which thou sawest on the right of me, and the seven lampstands the golden. The seven stars, messengers of the seven congregations are; and the lampstands the seven, seven congregations are.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>By the messenger of the in Ephesus congregation do thou write: These things says the one holding the seven stars in the right of himself, the one walking in midst of the seven lampstands the golden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know the works of thee, and the toil of thee, and the patient endurance of thee, and that not thou art able to bear with bad ones; and thou hast tried those declaring themselves apostles to be, and not they are; and thou hast found them liars;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>and patient endurance thou hast, and thou hast suffered on account of the name of me, and not thou hast wearied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have against thee, because the love of thee the first thou hast relaxed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Do thou remember therefore whence thou hast fallen, and change thy mind, and the first works do thou; if but not, I am coming to thee speedily, and I will remove the lampstand of thee out of the place of itself, if not thou dost change thy mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But that thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations. To the one overcoming I will give to him to eat from the wood of life, which is in the paradise of the God of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And by the messenger of the in Smyrna congregation do thou write: These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know of thee the works, and the affliction, and the poverty, (but rich thou art,) and the blasphemy from those declaring Jews to be themselves, and not are, but an assembly of the adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Not fear thou the things thou art about to suffer; lo, is about to cast the accuser from of you into prison, so that you may be tried; and you shall have affliction days ten. Be thou faithful till death, and I will give to thee the crown of the life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations. The one overcoming not not he may be hurt by the death the second.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And by the messenger of the in Pergamos congregation do thou write: These things says the one having the broad sword that twomouthed the sharp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know the works of thee, and where thou dwellest, where the throne of the adversary; and thou holdest fast the name of me, and not thou didst deny the faith of me, even in those days in which Antipas the witness of me the faithful, who was killed among you, where the adversary dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have against thee a few things, because thou hast there some holding the teaching of Balaam, who instructed the Balak to cast a stumblingblock before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to fornicate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So hast also thou some holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans in like manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Change thy mind therefore; if but not, I am coming to thee quickly, and I will war with them by the broadsword of the mouth of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>The one having an ear, let him hear what the spirit says to the congregations. To the one coming I will give to him of the manna of that having been hidden, and I will give to him a pebble white, and on the pebble a name new having been written, which no one knows if not the one receiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And by the messenger of the in Thyatira congregation write: These things says the son of the God, the one having the eyes of himself as a flame of fire, and the feet of him like to fine white brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know of thee the works, and the love, and the faith, and the service, and the patient endurance of thee, and the works of thee the last more of the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have against thee, because thou lettest alone the wife of thee Jezebel, the one calling herself a prophetess, and she teaches and seduces the my bondservants, to fornicate and to eat idol sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave to her time so that she might reform, and not she wills to reform from the fornication of herself;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>lo, I cast her into a bed, and those committing adultery with her into affliction great, if not they should reform from the works of her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>and the children of her I will kill with death; and I shall know all the congregations, that I am the one searching reins and hearts; and I will give to you to each one according to the works of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>To you but I say, to the remaining ones to those in Thyatira, as many as not hold the teaching this, who not knew the depths of the adversary (as they say). Not I will lay on you other burden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>but what you have, hold fast till of which I may have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And the one overcoming, and the one keeping till an end the works of me, I will give to him authority over the nations;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>and he shall rule them with a rod made of iron, as the vessels those earthen ones it is breaking together, as also I received from of the Father of me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>and I will give to him thew star the morning.</verse>

      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And by the messenger of the in Sardis congregation write: These things says the one having the seven spirits of the God, and the seven stars. I know of thee the works, that a name thou hast that thou livest, and dead thou art.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Become thou vigilant, and strengthen the things remaining which were about to die; not for I have found of thee the works having been complete in presence of the God of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember thou therefore how thou hast received and thou didst hear, and observe, and reform. If therefore not thou shouldst have watched, I may have come on thee as a thief, and not not thou mayest have known what hour I may have come on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But thou hast a few names in Sardis, which not soiled the garments of themselves; and they shall walk with me in white (robes), because worthy they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>The one overcoming, this shall invest himself with garments white; and not not I will blot out the name of him out of the scroll of the life, and I will confess the name of him in presence of the Father of me, and in presence of the messengers of him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Lo, I give out of the assembly of the adversary those saying themselves Jews, to be, and not they are, but speak falsely; lo, I will make them, so that they may have come and may have prostrated before the feet of thee, and they may have known, that I loved thee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>because thou hast kept the word of the patience of me, also I thee will keep from the hour of the trial of that being about to come on the habitable whole, to try those dwelling on the earth.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>The one overcoming, I will make him a pillar in the temple of the God of me, and outside not not he may have gone out any more; and I will write on him the name of the God of me, and the name of the city of the God of me, of the new Jerusalem, that coming down out of the heaven from the God of me, and the name of me the new.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>and the one sitting like in appearance to a stone a jasper and a sardius; and a rainbow around about the throne like in appearance to an emerald.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And round about the throne thrones twentyfour; and on the thrones twentyfour elders sitting, having been clothed, with garments white, and on the heads of them crowns golden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And from the throne proceed lightnings and voices and thunders; and seven lamps of fire burning in presence of the throne, which are the seven spirits of the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>and in presence of the throne as a sea made of glass, like crystal; and in midst of the throne and in a circle of the throne four living ones being full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the living one the first like to a lion, and the second living one like to a young bullock, and the third living one had the face of a man, and the fourth living one like to an eagle flying.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when shall give the living ones glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne, to the one living for the ages of the ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>shall fall down the twentyfour elders in presence of the one sitting on the throne, and they shall do homage to the one living for the ages of the ages, and they shall cast the crowns of themselves in presence of the throne saying;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>worthy thou art, O Lord, to receive the glory and the honor and the power; because thou didst create the all things, and on account of the will of thee they were, and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw on the right of the one sitting on the throne a scroll having been written within and at the back, having been sealed up with seals seven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a messenger strong, publishing with a voice great: Who is worthy to open the scroll, and to loose the seals of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one was able in the heaven, nor on the earth, nor under the earth, to open the scroll, nor to see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I was weeping much, because no one worthy was found to open the scroll, nor to see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders says to me: Not do thou weep; lo, prevailed the lion that of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, to open the scroll and the seven seals of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw in midst of the throne and of the four living ones, and in midst of the elders, a young lamb having been standing as having been slaughtered, it had horns seven, and eyes seven, they are the seven spirits of the God those having been sent forth into all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the scroll from the right of the one sitting on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he took the scroll, the four living ones and the twentyfour elders fell down in presence of the lamb, having each one harps, and bowls golden being full of odors, which are the prayers of the holy ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sung a song new, saying: Worthy thou art to receive the scroll, and to open the seals of it; because thou wast slain, and didst buy back for the God us with the blood of thee out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>and thou didst make them to the God of us kings and priests, and they shall reign on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I saw, and I heard a voice of messengers many in a circle of the throne and of the living ones and of the elders; and was the number of them myriads of myriads, and thousands of thousands;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a voice great: Worthy is the lamb that having been killed to receive the power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every created thing which is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and on the sea which is, and the things in them, all, I heard saying: To the one sitting on the throne and to the lamb the blessing and the honor and the glory and the might for the ages of the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living ones said: So be it; and the elders fell down and did homage.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw when opened the lamb one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living ones saying, as a voice of thunder: Come thou and see thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I saw, and lo a horse white, and the one sitting on him having a bow; and was given to him a crown, and he came out conquering, and that he might conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he opened the seal the second, I heard the second living one saying: Come thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And came out another horse red; and to the one sitting on him it was given to him to take the peace from the earth, and so that each other they might kill; and was given to him a sword great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he opened the seal the third I heard the third living one saying: Come thou and see thou. And I saw, and lo a horse black, and the one sitting on him having a balance in the hand of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in midst of the four living ones saying: A small measure of wheat for a denarius; and three small measures of barley for a denarius; and the oil and the wine not thou mayest hurt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he opened the seal the fourth, I heard the fourth living one saying: Come and see thou.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I saw, and lo a horse pale, and the one sitting on him, a name to him the Death; and the unseen followed with him; and was given to him authority over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with death, and by the wild beasts of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those having been killed because of the word of the God, and because of the testimony which they held;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>and they cried with a voice great, saying: How long, the sovereign the holy one and true one, not thou judgest and avengest the blood of us from those dwelling on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And was given to them a robe white, and it was said to them, that they should rest yet a time, till should be completed also the fellowslaves of them and the brethren of them, those being about to be killed as even they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when he opened the seal the sixth, and an earthquake great was, and the sun black became as sackcloth of hair, and the moon whole became as blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars of the heaven fell to the earth, as a figtree casts the untimely figs of her by a wind great being shaken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>and the heaven was separated from as a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island out of the places of themselves were moved;</verse>
