The Emphatic Diaglott

About=From the title page we read as follows: "The Emphatic Diaglott, containing the
original Greek text of what is commonly styled the New Testament (according to the
recension of Dr. J. J. Griesbach) with an interlineary translation, on the renderings
of eminent critics, and on the various readings of The Vatican Manuscript, No. 1209, in
the Vatican Library, together with illustrative and explanatory foot notes, and a
copious selection of references, ..., by Benjamin Wilson."

Although the translator does not claim this version to be superior to any other, he
feels that this work presents certain valuable features not found elsewhere. These are
listed in the Preface.

Careful fidelity in giving true rendering of the original text into English has been
maintained throughout. No regard whatever has been given to prevailing doctrines or
prejudices of sects, or the peculiar tenets of theologians.

Help in this work was derived from works of great and learned men. The sources include
the following: lexicons, grammars, ancient and modern versions, commentaries (critical
and explanatory), cyclopedias, and dictionaries (Bible and others). It is not presumed
that this work is free from faults and errors.

      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>The indeed first account I made concerning all things, O Theophilus, which began the Jesus to do and also to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>even to which day, having given charge to the apostles, through spirit holy whom he chose, he was taken up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>To whom also he presented himself living after the to suffer him, in many clear proofs, through days forty being seen by them, and saying the things concerning the kingdom of the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And assembling them he command them, from Jerusalem not to depart, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which you heard from me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>that John indeed dipped in water, you but shall be dipped in spirit holy, not after many these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>They indeed therefore having come together, asked him; saying: O lord, if in the time this thou restorest the kingdom to the Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>He said and to them: Not for you it is to know times or seasons, which the Father placed in the own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But you shall receive power having come the holy spirit upon you; and you shall be to me witnesses in both Jerusalem, and in all the Judea and in Samaria, and even to farthest part of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And these things having said, beholding of them he was lifted up; and a cloud withdrew him from the eyes of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And as fixedly gazing they were into the heaven, going away of him, and lo, men two were standing by them in raiment white,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>they and said: Men of Galilee, why stand you looking into the heaven? this the Jesus, he being taken up from you into the heaven, thus will come, which manner you saw him going into the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned into Jerusalem from a mountain that being called of olivetrees, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath being distant journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they came into, they went up into the upper room, where were remaining, the, both Peter and James, and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James of Alpheus also Simon the zealot and Judas of James.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>These all were being constantly engaged with one mind in the prayer, with women, and Mary the mother of the Jesus, and with the brothers of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in the days these having stood up Peter in middle of the disciples, he said: (was and a crowd of names, in the same about a hundred twenty;)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Men brethren, it was necessary to be fulfilled the writing this, which spoke before the spirit the holy through mouth of David, about Judas that having become a guide to those having seized the Jesus;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>because having been numbered he was among us, and obtained the lot of the service this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>This indeed therefore bought a field out of a reward of the wickedness; and headforemost having fallen, he burst in middle, and were poured out all the bowels of him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>and known became to all those dwelling in Jerusalem, so as to be called the field that in the own language of them, Aceldama, this is, a field of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>It is written for in book of psalms: Let be the dwelling of him desolate, and not let be the dwelling in her; and, The charge of him let take another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>It is necessary therefore of those having associated with us men in all time, in which went in and went out among us the Lord Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>beginning from the dipping of John to the day which he was taken up from us, a witness of the resurrection of him to become with us one of these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they set forth two, Joseph that being call Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And praying they said: Thou, O Lord, heartknower of all, show which thou didst select out of these the two one,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to take the lot of the service this and apostleship, from which stepped aside Judas, to go into the place the own.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they gave lots of them; and fell the lot on Matthias, and he was counted with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And in the to be fully come the day of the Pentecost, were all with one mind in the same.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And were suddenly from the heaven a sound as of a rushing wind violent, and it filled whole the house, were they were sitting;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>and they saw with them being divided tongues like fire; sat and on one each one of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>and they were filled all spirit holy, and they began to speak with other tongues, as the spirit gave to them to speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Were now in Jerusalem dwelling Jews, men pious, from every nation of those under the heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>Having happened and the sound this, came together the multitude, and were perplexed; because heard one each in the own language speaking of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>Were astonished and all and wondered, saying to each other: Not lo all these are who are speaking Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>And how we hear each one in the own language of us, in which we were born,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those dwelling the Mesopotamia, Judea both and Cappadocia, Pontus and the Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>Phrygia both and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of the Lybia that upon Cyrene, and those sojourning Romans, Jews both and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretans and Arabians, we hear speaking them in the our tongues the great things of the God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>Were astonished and all and perplexed, one to another saying: What will this to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>Others but deriding said: That sweet wine having been filled they are.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>Standing up but Peter with the eleven, lifted up the voice of himself, and said to them: Men Jews, and those dwelling in Jerusalem all, this to you known let be, and listen you the words of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>Not for, as you suppose, these are drunk; it is for hour third of the day;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>but this is that having been spoken through the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it shall be in the last the days, say the God, I will pour out from of the spirit of me upon all flesh; and shall prophesy the sons of you and the daughters of you, and the young men of you visions shall see, and the old men of you dreams shall dream;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>and even on the maleslaves of me and on the femaleslaves of me in the days those I will pour out from of the spirit of me, and they shall prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I will give prodigies in the heaven above, and signs on the earth below, blood and fire and a cloud of smoke;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>the sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, sooner than to come the day of Lord the great and illustrations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And it shall be, every one who may call upon the name of Lord, shall be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Men Israelites, hear you the words these: Jesus the Nazarene, a man from the God having been pointed out to you by mighty works and prodigies and signs, (which did through him the God in midst of you, as also yourselves you know,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>this by the having been fixed purpose and foreknowledge of the God given up having been taken, by hands of lawless ones having affixed to you killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>Whom the God raised up; having loosed the pains of the death, in as much as not was possible to be held him under it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>David for says concerning him: I saw the Lord in presence of me always, because at right hand of he is, so that not I may be shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Through this rejoiced the heart of me, and exulted the tongue of me; moreover and also the flesh of me will repose in hope;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>because not thou will abandon the life of me to invisibility, nor thou wilt abandon the holy one of thee to see corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou didst make known to me ways of life; thou will fill me of joy with the face of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Men brethren, it is lawful to speak with freedom to you concerning the patriarch David, that both he died and was buried, and the tomb of him is among us till of the day this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>A prophet there being, and knowing that with an oath swore to him the God, out of fruit of the loins of him to cause to sit on the throne of him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>foreseeing he spoke concerning the resurrection of the Anointed, that not he was abandoned into invisibility, nor the flesh of him saw corruption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This the Jesus raised up the God, of which all we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>To the right hand therefore of the God having been exalted, the and promise of the holy spirit having received from the Father, he poured out this, which you see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>Not for David ascended into the heavens; he says but himself: Said the Lord to the lord of me: Sit thou at right hand of me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>till I may place the enemies of thee a footstool for the feet of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Certainly therefore let know all house of Israel, that both Lord him and Anointed the God made, this the Jesus, whom you crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Having heard and they were pierced to the heart, said and to the Peter and the other apostles: What shall we do, men brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>Peter and said to them: Reform you, and be dipped each one of you in the name of Jesus Anointed, for forgiveness of sins, and you shall receive the gifts of the holy spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>To you for is the promise and to the children of you, and to all those at a distance as many as may call Lord the God of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>Other and words with many he testified, and exhorted, saying: Be saved from the generation of the perverse this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>They indeed therefore gladly having received the word of him, were dipped; and were added the day that souls about three thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>Were and constantly attending to the teachings of the apostles, and to the distribution, and to the breaking of the loaf, and to the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>Came and to every soul fear, many and prodigies and signs through the apostles were done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>All and those believing were in the same, and had all things common,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>and the possessions and the goods they were selling; and they were dividing them to all, as any one need had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>Every day and constantly attending with one mind in the temple, breaking and at home bread, they were partaking of food in gladness and singleness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising the God, and having favor with whole the people. The and Lord was adding those being saved everyday to the congregation.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certain man lame from womb of mother of himself being, was being carried; whom they placed every day at the door of the temple that being called beautiful, the to ask alms from those entering into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>Who seeing Peter and John being about to go into the temple, asked alms to receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>Looking steadily and Peter on him with the John, said: Look on us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>He and gave heed to them, expecting something from them to receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>Said and Peter: Silver and gold not are possessed by me; what but I have, this to thee I give. In the name of Jesus Anointed the Nazarene do thou arise and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And having taken him the right hand he rose up; immediately and were strengthened of him the feet and the anklebones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And leaping up he stood, and walked; and entered with them into the temple, walking and leaping, and praising the God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And saw him all the people walking and praising the God;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>they knew and him, that he was who for the alms sitting at the beautiful gate of the temple; and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that having happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>Holding fast and of him the Peter and John, ran together to them all the people to the porch that being called of Solomon, awestruck.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>Seeing and Peter answered to the people: Men Israelites, why do you wonder at this? or to us why look you earnestly, as by own power or piety having been made of the to walk him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of the fathers of us, glorified the servant of himself Jesus, whom you indeed delivered up, and denied him in face of Pilate, having judged he to release.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>You but the holy and righteous denied, and asked a man a murderer to be granted to you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>the and prince of the life you killed; whom the God raised out of dead ones, of whom we witnesses are;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>and by the faith of the name of him, this whom you behold and know, strengthened the name of him; and the faith that through him gave to him the perfect soundness this in presence of all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brethren, I know that in ignorance you did, as also the rulers of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>The but God what he foretold through mouth of all of the prophets of himself, to suffer the Anointed, he fulfilled thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Reform you therefore and turn you, in order that the to be wiped out of you the sins, that may come seasons of refreshing from face of the Lord,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they laid on them the hands, and put into keeping to the morrow; it was for evening now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>Many but of those having heard the word believed; and became the number of the men about thousand five.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>It happened and on the morrow to be assembled of them the rulers and elders and scribes at Jerusalem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>also Annas the highpriest, and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and as many as were of the family of highpriesthood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And having placed them in middle they asked: By what power, or in what name did this you?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter being filled with spirit holy, said to them: Rulers of the people, and elders of the Israel,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the stone that having been despised by you the builders, the having been made into a head of a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And not is in another to any one the salvation; not even for a name is another under the heaven, that having been given among men, in which must to be saved us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Seeing and the of the Peter boldness and of John, and having perceived, that men unlearned they are and ungifted, they wondered, they knew and them, that with the Jesus they were;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>the and man beholding with them standing that having been healed, nothing they had to say against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>Having ordered and them outside of the highcouncil to go, they consulted with each other,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying: What shall we do to the men these? that indeed for known a sign has been done by them, to all those dwelling in Jerusalem manifest, and not we were able to deny.</verse>
