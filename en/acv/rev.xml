        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>The Revelation of Jesus Christ that God gave him to show his bondmen what must happen quickly. And he signified it, having sent by his agent to his bondman John</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who testified the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as many things as he saw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who reads, and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and who keep the things written in it, for the time is near.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>John, to the seven congregations in Asia: Grace to you and peace from God, who is and who was and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits that are before his throne,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and washed us from our sins by his blood</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him is the glory and the dominion into the ages of the ages. Truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he comes with the clouds and every eye will see him, even the men who pierced him. And all the tribes of the earth will wail against him. Yea, Truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am the Alpha and the Omega, says Lord, the God who is and who was and who is coming, the Almighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I John, your brother and companion in the tribulation and kingdom and perseverance in Christ Jesus, happened to be on the isle that is called Patmos because of the word of God, and because of the testimony of Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I became in spirit on the Lord's day and I heard behind me a great voice like a trumpet</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>saying, What thou see, write in a book and send to the seven congregations: to Ephesus, and to Smyrna, and to Pergamos, and to Thyatira, and to Sardis, and to Philadelphia, and to Laodicea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned there to see the voice that spoke with me. And having turned I saw seven golden lampstands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>And in the midst of the seven lampstands, resembling a son of man, he who was clothed down to the foot, and girded about with a golden belt at the breasts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>And his head and hair were white as wool, white as snow, and his eyes as a flame of fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet resembling highly refined metal, as in a furnace having been fiery hot, and his voice as the sound of many waters,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>and having in his right hand seven stars, and a sharp two-edged sword coming out of his mouth. And the sight of him was as the sun shines in its strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying, Fear not, I am the first and the last,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and he who lives. And I became dead, and behold, I am living into the ages of the ages. Truly. And I have the keys of death and of Hades.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Therefore write the things that thou saw, and things that are, and things that are going to happen after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>The mystery of the seven stars that thou saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands: the seven stars are agents of the seven congregations, and the seven lampstands that thou saw are the seven congregations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the agent of the congregation in Ephesus write, These things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, he who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know thy works, and thy toil, and thy perseverance, and that thou cannot tolerate evil, and thou examined those who say themselves to be apostles, and are not, and found them false.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And thou have perseverance. And thou endured because of my name, and did not become weary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>Nevertheless, I have against thee because thou left thy first love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember therefore from where thou have fallen, and repent and do the first works. And if not, I come to thee quickly, and will move thy lampstand out of its place, if thou do not repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this thou have, that thou hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. To him who overcomes, I will give him to eat from the tree of life that is in the midst of the Paradise of my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the agent of the congregation in Smyrna write, These things says the first and the last, who became dead, and lived:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know thy works and tribulation and poverty (but thou are rich), and the blasphemy of those who say themselves to be Jews, and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear none of the things that thou are going to suffer. Behold, the devil is indeed going to cast some of you into prison, so that ye may be tried, and ye will have tribulation ten days. Become thou faithful until death, and I will</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. He who overcomes will, no, not be hurt from the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the agent of the congregation in Pergamos write, These things says he who has the sharp two-edged sword:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know thy works, and where thou dwell, where Satan's throne is. And thou hold firm my name, and did not deny my faith in the days in which Antipas was my faithful witness, who was killed among you where Satan dwells.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have a few things against thee, because thou have there men who adhere to the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to cast a snare before the sons of Israel, even to eat idol sacrifices, and to fornicate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So also thou have men who likewise adhere to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>Repent therefore, and if not I come to thee quickly, and will war against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations. To him who overcomes, I will give him to eat of the hidden manna. And I will give him a white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which none knows</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the agent of the congregation in Thyatira write, These things says the Son of God, who has his eyes as a flame of fire, and his feet resembling highly refined metal:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know thy works, and thy love and faith and service and perseverance. And thy last works are more than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>Nevertheless, I have against thee that thou tolerate thy woman Jezebel. She calls herself a prophetess, and teaches and leads astray my bondmen to fornicate, and to eat idol sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time so that she would repent, and she did not want to repent of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I throw her into a bed, and those who commit adultery with her into great tribulation, if they do not repent of her works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And I will kill her children in death. And all the congregations will know that I am he who searches the inner feelings and hearts. And I will give to you--to each--according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But I say to you, to those remaining in Thyatira, as many as have not this teaching, who do not know, as they say, the deep things of Satan, I do not cast upon you another burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>But hold firm what ye have until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he who overcomes, and he who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>And he will tend them with a rod of iron (they will be shattered like ceramic vessels), as I also have received from my Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>And I will give him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>And to the agent of the congregation in Sardis write, These things says he who has the seven Spirits of God, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that thou have a name that thou live, and thou are dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Become thou watchful, and strengthen the remaining things that thou were going to throw away, for I have not found thy works made complete before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember therefore how thou have received and heard, and be on guard, and repent. If therefore thou will not watch, I will come upon thee as a thief, and thou will, no, not know what hour I will come upon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But thou have a few names in Sardis who did not defile their garments. And they will walk with me in white, because they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who overcomes, this man will be clothed in white garments, and I will, no, not erase his name out of the book of life. And I will acknowledge his name before my Father, and before his agents.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the agent of the congregation in Philadelphia write, These things says the Holy, the True, he who has the key of David, who opens, and none will shut it except he who opens, and none will open:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know thy works. Behold, I have given before thee an opened door that none is able to shut it, because thou have little power, and thou keep my word, and did not deny my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I give of the synagogue of Satan, those who say themselves to be Jews, and are not, but lie, behold, I will make them so that they will come and bow down before thy feet, and may know that I have loved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because thou keep the word of my perseverance, I also will keep thee from the hour of trial that is going to come upon the whole inhabited world, to try those who dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I come quickly, hold firm what thou have, so that none may take thy crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will, no, not go out any more. And I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem (it comes down out of the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the congregations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the agent of the congregation in Laodicea write, These things says the Truly, the faithful and TRUE witness, the primacy of the creation of God:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know thy works, that thou are neither cold nor hot. O that thou were cold or hot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So because thou are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I am going to spew thee out of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because thou say, I am rich, and have become wealthy, and have need of nothing, and do not know that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel thee to buy from me gold refined from fire, so that thou may become wealthy, and white garments, so that thou may clothe thyself, and the shame of thy nakedness may not be made known, and eye-salve, so that thou may anoin</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous therefore, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>He who overcomes, I will give him to sit with me in my throne, as I also overcame, and sat down with my Father in his throne.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>After these things I looked, and behold, a door opened in heaven, and the first voice that I heard like a trumpet, speaking with me, saying, Come up here, and I will show thee what must happen after these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>And straightaway I became in spirit. And behold, a throne was set in heaven, and him sitting upon the throne</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>similar in appearance to a jasper and a sardius stone. And a rainbow was around the throne, like an emerald in appearance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>And around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and upon the thrones were sitting twenty-four elders clothed in white garments, and golden crowns upon their heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And out of the throne proceeds lightnings and voices and thunders. And seven lamps of fire burned before his throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And before the throne was like a glassy sea similar to crystal. And in the midst of the throne, and all around the throne, were four beings containing eyes in front and back.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first being was similar to a lion, and the second being was similar to a young bull, and the third being having a face like a man, and the fourth being was similar to a flying eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And the four beings, one by one, each having six wings, are full of eyes around and inside. And they have no cessation day and night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord, the Almighty God, he was, and who is, and who is coming.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And whenever the beings give glory and honor and thanks to him who sits on the throne, he who lives into the ages of the ages,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the twenty-four elders would fall down before him who sits on the throne, and would worship him who lives into the ages of the ages, and would cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>Thou are worthy, our Lord and God, the Holy, to take the glory and the honor and the power, because thou created all things, and because by thy will they are, and were created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>And I saw at the right hand of him who sits on the throne a book, written inside and outside, sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a powerful agent proclaiming in a great voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals of it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And none in heaven above nor on the earth nor under the earth was able to open the book or to see in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much because none was found worthy to open the book or to see in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the elders says to me, Weep not, behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, overcame to open the book and the seven seals of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four beings, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, like it had been killed, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God being sent forth into all</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took it out of the right hand of him who sits on the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he took the book, the four beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls containing incense, which are the prayers of the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they sing a new song, saying, Thou are worthy to take the book and to open the seals of it, because thou were killed and purchased us from God by thy blood, out of every tribe, and tongue, and people, and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And thou made them kings and priests to our God, and they will reign over the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I looked, and I heard as a voice of many agents all around the throne and the beings and the elders. And the number of them was ten thousands of ten thousands, and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>saying with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that has been killed to receive the power, and wealth, and wisdom, and strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature that is in the heaven, and on the earth, and under the earth, and is in the sea, and things in them all, I heard saying, The blessing, and the honor, and the glory, and the dominion is to him who sits upon the th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four beings were saying the Truly. And the elders fell down and worshiped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>And I saw that the Lamb opened one of the seven seals. And I heard one of the four beings saying like the sound of thunder, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And behold, a white horse, and he who sits on it having a bow. And a crown was given to him, and he went forth conquering, and so that he might conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second being saying, Come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And another horse came forth, fiery red. And it was given to him (to him who sits on it) to take peace from the earth, so that they would kill each other. And a great sword was given to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third being saying, Come and see. And behold, a black horse, and he who sits on it having a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beings saying, A measure of wheat for a denarius, and three measures of barley for a denarius. And thou may not harm the olive oil and the wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the fourth being saying, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And behold, a green horse, and he who sits on top of it. His name was Death, and Hades followed with him. And authority was given to him over the fourth part of the earth, to kill with sword, and with starvation, and with what is d</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw underneath the altar the souls of those who had been killed because of the word of God, and because of the testimony of the Lamb that they held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried out in a great voice, saying, Master, Holy and True, how long do thou not judge and avenge our blood from those who dwell on the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And a white robe was given to them each, and it was said to them that they should still rest a time, until also their fellow bondmen, and their brothers, and those going to be killed as they too, would be fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I looked when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake occurred, and the sun became black as hairy sackcloth, and the whole moon became as blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>And the stars of the sky fell to the earth as a fig tree that casts its unripe figs being shaken by a great wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the sky departed as a scroll being rolled up. And every mountain and island were moved out of their places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>And the kings of the earth, and the rulers, and the chief captains, and the rich, and the strong, and every bondman and freeman, hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him who sits on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>Because the great day of his wrath has come, and who is able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>And after this I saw four agents standing at the four corners of the earth, restraining the four winds of the earth, so that wind would not blow on the earth, or on the sea, or upon any tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another agent ascending from the sun-rising, having a seal of the living God. And he cried out in a great voice to the four agents to whom it was given to them to harm the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, Do not harm the earth, nor the sea, nor the trees, until we may seal the bondmen of our God on their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of those sealed, a hundred and forty-four thousand sealed out of every tribe of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>Twelve thousand were sealed from the tribe of Judah, twelve thousand from the tribe of Reuben, twelve thousand from the tribe of Gad,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.7.8'>twelve thousand from the tribe of Zebulun, twelve thousand from the tribe of Joseph, twelve thousand from the tribe of Benjamin, were sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.9'>After these things, I looked and lo, a great multitude, which none could number, out of every nation, and tribes and peoples and tongues, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, and palms in their ha</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.16.1'>And I heard a great voice out of the temple, saying to the seven agents, Go ye and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God into the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.2'>And the first went and poured out his bowl into the earth, and a bad and evil sore developed upon the men who have the mark of the beast and who worship its image.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.3'>And the second agent poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became blood like of a dead man, and every living soul in the sea died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.4'>And the third agent poured out his bowl into the rivers and into the springs of the waters, and they became blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.5'>And I heard the agent of the waters saying, Thou are righteous who is and was--the Divine--because thou judged these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.6'>Because they poured out the blood of the sanctified and prophets, and thou have given them blood to drink--they are deserving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.7'>And I heard the altar saying, Yea, Lord God Almighty, TRUE and righteous are thy judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.8'>And the fourth agent poured out his bowl upon the sun, and it was given him to scorch men with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.9'>And the men were scorched with great heat. And the men blasphemed the name of God who has power over these plagues, and they did not repent to give him glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.10'>And the fifth agent poured out his bowl upon the throne of the beast, and its kingdom became darkened, and they gnawed their tongues from the anguish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.11'>And they blasphemed the God of heaven from their pains and from their sores. And they did not repent of their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.12'>And the sixth agent poured out his bowl upon the great river Euphrates, and the water of it was dried up, so that the way of the kings from the sun-rising might be prepared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.13'>And I saw out of the mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the FALSE prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.14'>For they are spirits of demons, doing signs that go forth to the kings of the whole world, to gather them together to the battle of that great day of the Almighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.15'>(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches, and keeps his garments, so that he may not walk naked, and they see his shame.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.16'>And he gathered them together into the place called in Hebrew, Armageddon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.17'>And the seventh agent poured out his bowl upon the air, and a great voice came forth out of the temple of heaven, out of the throne, saying, It has come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.18'>And there occurred lightnings, and thunders, and voices. And a great earthquake occurred, such as did not happen from that time men came to be upon the earth, so mighty an earthquake, so great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.19'>And the great city became in three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And the great Babylon was remembered before God, to give to it the cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.20'>And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.16.21'>And great hail, like a talent weight, descended out of the sky upon men. And the men blasphemed God from the plague of the hail, because the plague of it was exceedingly great.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.17'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.1'>And one of the seven agents who had the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, Come, I will show thee the judgment of the great whore who sits upon the many waters</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.2'>with whom the kings of the earth fornicated, and those who inhabit the earth were made drunken with the wine of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.3'>And he carried me away in spirit into a wilderness. And I saw a woman sitting upon a scarlet-colored beast containing names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.4'>And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls, having in her hand a golden cup containing abominations and the filthy things of her fornication,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.5'>and upon her forehead a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF WHORES AND OF THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.6'>And I saw the woman drunken from the blood of the sanctified, and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus. And having seen her, I wondered with great amazement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.7'>And the agent said to me, Why did thou wonder? I will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that carries her, which has the seven heads and the ten horns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.8'>The beast that thou saw was, and is not, and is going to ascend out of the abyss and go into destruction. And those who dwell on the earth will wonder, whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.9'>Here is the mind that has wisdom: The seven heads are seven mountains where the woman sits on them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.10'>And there are seven kings, the five are fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes he must remain a little while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.11'>And the beast that was, and is not, he also is an eighth, and is of the seven, and he goes into destruction.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.12'>And the ten horns that thou saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they receive authority as kings one hour with the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.13'>These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.14'>These will war against the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. And those with him are the called and chosen and faithful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.15'>And he says to me, The waters that thou saw, where the whore sits, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and tongues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.16'>And the ten horns that thou saw, and the beast, these will hate the whore, and will make her desolate, and will make her naked, and will eat her flesh, and will burn her with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.17'>For God gave in their hearts to do his will. Even to do one will, and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God would be ended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.17.18'>And the woman whom thou saw is the great city having reign over the kings of the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.18'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.1'>And after these things I saw another agent coming down out of heaven having great authority, and the earth was illuminated from his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.2'>And he cried out in a mighty voice, saying, Babylon the great has fallen, has fallen, and became a habitation of demons, and a hold of every unclean spirit, and a hold of every unclean and hated bird.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.3'>Because all the nations have drunk from the wine of the wrath of her fornication. And the kings of the earth fornicated with her, and the merchants of the earth became rich from the power of her wantonness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.4'>And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out from her, my people, so that ye may not participate with her sins, and that ye may not receive from her plagues.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.5'>Because her sins have reached as far as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.6'>Render to her as she also rendered to you, and double to her two-fold according to her works. In the cup that she mixed, mix two-fold for her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.7'>In an amount she glorified herself and lived wantonly, give her so much torment and grief, because she says in her heart, I sit a queen, and am no widow, and will, no, not see grief.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.8'>Because of this her plagues will come in one day, death, and grief, and famine. And she will be utterly burned with fire, because strong is Lord, the God who judged her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.9'>And the kings of the earth who fornicated and lived wantonly with her, will weep and will beat their breasts for her when they see the smoke of her burning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.10'>having stood from afar because of the fear of her torment, saying, Alas, alas, the great city, Babylon, the mighty city! Because thy judgment has come in one hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.11'>And the merchants of the earth will weep and mourn for her, because no man buys their merchandise any more,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.12'>merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stone, and pearl, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet, and all thyine wood, and every ivory vessel, and every vessel of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron, and mar</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.13'>and cinnamon, and incense, and ointment, and frankincense, and wine, and olive oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and sheep, and cattle, and horses, and chariots, and bodies and souls of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.14'>And the fruit of the lust of thy soul have departed from thee. And all the fat and bright things are destroyed from thee. And thou will, no, not find them any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.15'>The merchants of these things who became rich from her will stand from afar because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.16'>and saying, Alas, alas, the great city, which was clothed in fine linen and purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.17'>Because in one hour such great wealth was devastated. And every shipmaster, and every man who sails anywhere, and sailors, and as many as work by sea, stood from afar</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.18'>and cried out seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, What is like the great city?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.19'>And they cast dust on their heads, and cried out, weeping and mourning, and saying, Alas, alas, the great city in which all who had ships in the sea became rich from her luxuriance! Because in one hour she was devastated.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.20'>Be glad over her, thou heaven, and the sanctified, and the apostles, and the prophets, because God has decreed your judgment of her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.21'>And one mighty agent took up a stone like a great millstone and cast it into the sea, saying, Thus in violence Babylon the great city will be thrown down, and will, no, not be found any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.22'>And a sound of harpers and minstrels and flute-players and trumpeters will, no, not be heard in thee any more. And every craftsman of every craft will, no, not be found in thee any more. And a sound of a millstone will, no, not be</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.23'>And the light of a lamp will, no, not shine in thee any more. And a voice of a bridegroom and of a bride will, no, not be heard in thee any more. Because thy merchants were the chief men of the earth, because all the nations were l</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.18.24'>And in her was found blood of prophets, and of the sanctified, and of all who have been killed upon the earth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.19'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.1'>And after these things I heard as a great sound of a large multitude in heaven, saying, Praise Lord, the salvation, and the power, and the glory of our God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.2'>Because TRUE and righteous are his judgments, because he has judged the great whore who ruined the earth by her fornication, and he has avenged the blood of his bondmen from her hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.3'>And a second time they said, Praise Lord! And the smoke of her ascended into the ages of the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.4'>And the twenty-four elders and the four beings fell down and worshiped God who sits on the throne, saying, Truly! Praise Lord!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.5'>And a voice came forth from the throne, saying, Praise ye our God, all his bondmen and those who fear him, the small and the great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.6'>And I heard as the sound of a large multitude, and as the sound of many waters, and as the sound of mighty thunders, saying, Praise Lord! Because Lord our God, the Almighty, reigns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.7'>We should be glad and rejoice and give the glory to him, because the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his wife has prepared herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.8'>And it was given her that she clothe herself in fine linen, bright and pure. For the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.9'>And he says to me, Write, Blessed are those who have been called to the supper of the marriage of the Lamb. And he says to me, These are the TRUE sayings of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.10'>And I fell down before his feet to worship him. And he says to me, See thou not. I am a fellow bondman of thee and thy brothers, those who have the testimony of Jesus. Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophe</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.11'>And I saw the heaven opened, and behold a white horse, and he who sits upon it called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.12'>And his eyes are a flame of fire, and upon his head are many diadems having names written, and a name written that none knows except he himself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.13'>and clothed in a garment dipped in blood. And his name is called The Word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.14'>And the armies in heaven followed him upon white horses, clothed in fine linen, pure white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.15'>And a sharp two-edged sword comes out of his mouth, so that he would smite the nations by it. And he will tend them with a rod of iron. And he treads the winepress of the wine of the wrath of the anger of the Almighty God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.16'>And he has on his garment and on his thigh a name written, KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.17'>And I saw one agent having stood in the sun, and he cried out in a great voice, saying to all the birds flying in mid-heaven, Come, gather together to the great supper of God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.18'>so that ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains, and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses and of those who sit upon them, and the flesh of all men, both freemen and bondmen, and both small and great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.19'>And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered together to make war against him who sits upon the horse, and against his army.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.20'>And the beast was taken, and the FALSE prophet with it who did the signs in its sight by which he led astray those who received the mark of the beast and those who worship its image. The two were thrown alive into the lake of fire</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.19.21'>And the others were killed by the sword that comes forth out of his mouth (of him who sits upon the horse), and all the birds were filled from their flesh.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Rev.20'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.1'>And I saw an agent coming down out of heaven having the key of the abyss and a great chain in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.2'>And he seized the dragon, the old serpent, who is the Devil and Satan, who leads the whole world astray, and bound him a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.3'>And he cast him into the abyss, and locked and sealed over him, so that he would no longer lead the nations astray until the thousand years were ended. After these things he must be loosed for a little time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.4'>And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them. And judgment was given to them and the souls of those who were beheaded because of the testimony of Jesus, and because of the word of God, and who did not worship the beast nor his image,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.5'>The rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.6'>Blessed and holy is he who has part in the first resurrection. On these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of the Christ, and will reign with him a thousand years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.7'>And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be loosed out of his prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.8'>And he will come forth to lead astray the nations in the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to the battle, of whom the number of them is as the sand of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.9'>And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and surrounded the encampment of the sanctified and the beloved city. And fire came down out of heaven from God, and devoured them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.10'>And the devil who leads them astray was cast into the lake of fire and brimstone, where also were the beast and the FALSE prophet. And they will be tormented day and night into the ages of the ages.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.11'>And I saw a great white throne, and him who sits upon it, from whose face the earth and the sky fled away, and no place was found for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.12'>And I saw the dead, the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the one of life. And the dead were judged from the things that were written in the books, accordi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.20.13'>And the sea gave up the dead in it, and death and Hades gave up the dead in them. And they were judged, each according to their works.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.21.3'>And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people. And God himself will be with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.21.4'>And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes. And there will not be any more death, nor grief, nor crying, nor will there be any more anguish, because the former things are gone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>And he showed me a pure river of water of life, bright as crystal, coming out from the throne of God and of the Lamb,</verse>
