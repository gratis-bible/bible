      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.1'>Now king David was old and stricken in years, and they covered him with clothes, but he did not get warm.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.2'>Therefore his servants said to him, Let there be sought for my lord the king a young virgin. And let her stand before the king, and take care of him. And let her lay in thy bosom, that my lord the king may get warmth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.3'>So they sought for a fair damsel throughout all the borders of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.4'>And the damsel was very fair. And she took care of the king, and ministered to him, but the king knew her not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.5'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king. And he prepared chariots for him, and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.6'>And his father had not displeased him at any time in saying, Why have thou done so? And he was also a very handsome man. And he was born after Absalom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.7'>And he conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah, and with Abiathar the priest. And, following Adonijah, they helped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.8'>But Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and Nathan the prophet, and Shimei, and Rei, and the mighty men who belonged to David, were not with Adonijah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.9'>And Adonijah killed sheep and oxen and fatlings by the stone of Zoheleth, which is beside En-rogel. And he called all his brothers, the king's sons, and all the men of Judah, the king's servants.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.10'>But he did not call Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah, and the mighty men, and Solomon his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.11'>Then Nathan spoke to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, saying, Have thou not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith reigns, and David our lord does not know it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.12'>Now therefore come, let me, I pray thee, give thee counsel, that thou may save thine own life, and the life of thy son Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.13'>Go and get thee in to king David, and say to him, Did thou not, my lord, O king, swear to thy handmaid, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne? Why then does Adonijah reign?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.14'>Behold, while thou yet talk there with the king, I also will come in after thee, and confirm thy words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.15'>And Bathsheba went in to the king into the chamber. And the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was ministering to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.16'>And Bathsheba bowed, and did obeisance to the king. And the king said, What do thou want?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.17'>And she said to him, My lord, thou swore by LORD thy God to thy handmaid, [saying], Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.18'>And now, behold, Adonijah reigns, and thou, my lord the king, do not know it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.19'>And he has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the sons of the king, and Abiathar the priest, and Joab the captain of the army, but he has not called Solomon thy servant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.20'>And thou, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are upon thee, that thou should tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.21'>Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king shall sleep with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon shall be considered offenders.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.22'>And, lo, while she yet talked with the king, Nathan the prophet came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.23'>And they told the king, saying, Behold, Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed himself before the king with his face to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.24'>And Nathan said, My lord, O king, have thou said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.25'>For he has gone down this day, and has slain oxen and fatlings and sheep in abundance, and has called all the king's sons, and the captains of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And, behold, they are eating and drinking before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.26'>But me, even me thy servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and thy servant Solomon, he has not called.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.27'>Is this thing done by my lord the king, and thou have not shown to thy servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.28'>Then king David answered and said, Call Bathsheba to me. And she came into the king's presence, and stood before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.29'>And the king swore, and said, As LORD lives, who has redeemed my soul out of all adversity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.30'>truly as I swore to thee by LORD, the God of Israel, saying, Assuredly Solomon thy son shall reign after me, and he shall sit upon my throne in my stead. Truly so I will do this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.31'>Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the earth, and did obeisance to the king, and said, Let my lord king David live forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.32'>And king David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And they came before the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.33'>And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord, and cause Solomon my son to ride upon my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.34'>And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there king over Israel. And blow ye the trumpet, and say, Live, king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.35'>Then ye shall come up after him, and he shall come and sit upon my throne, for he shall be king in my stead. And I have appointed him to be prince over Israel and over Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.36'>And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, and said, Amen. LORD, the God of my lord the king, say so [too].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.37'>As LORD has been with my lord the king, even so be he with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord king David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.38'>So Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites, went down, and caused Solomon to ride upon king David's mule, and brought him to Gihon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.39'>And Zadok the priest took the horn of oil out of the tent, and anointed Solomon. And they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, Live, king Solomon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.40'>And all the people came up after him, and the people piped with pipes, and rejoiced with great joy, so that the earth rent with the sound of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.41'>And Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they had made an end of eating. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, Why is this noise of the city being in an uproar?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.42'>While he yet spoke, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, Come in, for thou are a worthy man, and bring good news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.43'>And Jonathan answered and said to Adonijah, Truly our lord king David has made Solomon king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.44'>And the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, and Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they have caused him to ride upon the king's mule.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.45'>And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king in Gihon. And they have come up from there rejoicing, so that the city rang again. This is the noise that ye have heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.46'>And also Solomon sits on the throne of the kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.47'>And moreover the king's servants came to bless our lord king David, saying, Thy God make the name of Solomon better than thy name, and make his throne greater than thy throne. And the king bowed himself upon the bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.48'>And also thus said the king, Blessed be LORD, the God of Israel, who has given one of my seed to sit on my throne this day, my eyes even seeing it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.49'>And all the guests of Adonijah were afraid, and rose up, and every man went his way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.50'>And Adonijah feared because of Solomon. And he arose, and went, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.51'>And it was told Solomon, saying, Behold, Adonijah fears king Solomon, for, lo, he has laid hold on the horns of the altar, saying, Let king Solomon swear to me first that he will not kill his servant with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.52'>And Solomon said, If he shall show himself a worthy man, there shall not a hair of him fall to the earth, but if wickedness be found in him, he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.1.53'>So king Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and did obeisance to king Solomon. And Solomon said to him, Go to thy house.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.1'>Now the days of David drew near that he should die. And he charged Solomon his son, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.2'>I am going the way of all the earth. Be thou strong therefore, and show thyself a man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.3'>and keep the charge of LORD thy God, to walk in his ways, to keep his statutes, [and] his commandments, and his ordinances, and his testimonies, according to that which is written in the law of Moses, that thou may prosper in all t</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.4'>That LORD may establish his word which he spoke concerning me, saying, If thy sons take heed to their way, to walk before me in truth with all their heart and with all their soul, there shall not fail thee a man on the throne of Is</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.5'>Moreover thou also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, even what he did to the two captains of the armies of Israel, to Abner the son of Ner, and to Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, and shed the blood of war in pea</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.6'>Do therefore according to thy wisdom, and do not let his hoar head go down to Sheol in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.7'>But show kindness to the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be of those who eat at thy table, for so they came to me when I fled from Absalom thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.8'>And, behold, there is with thee Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjamite, of Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse in the day when I went to Mahanaim. But he came down to meet me at the Jordan, and I swore to him by LORD, sayin</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.9'>Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for thou are a wise man, and thou will know what thou ought to do to him, and thou shall bring his hoar head down to Sheol with blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.10'>And David slept with his fathers, and was buried in the city of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.11'>And the days that David reigned over Israel were forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron, and he reigned thirty-three years in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.12'>And Solomon sat upon the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was established greatly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.13'>Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do thou come peaceably? And he said, Peaceably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.14'>He said moreover, I have something to say to thee. And she said, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.15'>And he said, Thou know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel set their faces on me, that I should reign. However the kingdom is turned about, and has become my brother's, for it was his from LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.16'>And now I ask one petition of thee; do not deny me. And she said to him, Say on.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.17'>And he said, Speak, I pray thee, to Solomon the king (for he will not say no thee), that he give me Abishag the Shunammite to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.18'>And Bathsheba said, Well, I will speak for thee to the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.19'>Bathsheba therefore went to king Solomon to speak to him for Adonijah. And the king rose up to meet her, and bowed himself to her, and sat down on his throne, and caused a throne to be set for the king's mother. And she sat on his</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.20'>Then she said, I ask one small petition of thee; do not deny me. And the king said to her, Ask on, my mother, for I will not deny thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.21'>And she said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah thy brother to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.22'>And king Solomon answered and said to his mother, And why do thou ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my elder brother, even for him, and for Abiathar the priest, and for Joab the son of</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.23'>Then king Solomon swore by LORD, saying, God do so to me, and more also, if Adonijah has not spoken this word against his own life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.24'>Now therefore as LORD lives, who has established me, and set me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house as he promised, surely Adonijah shall be put to death this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.25'>And king Solomon sent by Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he fell upon him so that he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.26'>And the king said to Abiathar the priest, Get thee to Anathoth, to thine own fields, for thou are worthy of death. But I will not at this time put thee to death, because thou bore the ark of lord LORD before David my father, and be</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.27'>So Solomon thrust out Abiathar from being priest to LORD, that he might fulfill the word of LORD, which he spoke concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.28'>And the news came to Joab, for Joab had turned after Adonijah, though he did not turn after Absalom. And Joab fled to the tent of LORD, and caught hold on the horns of the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.29'>And it was told king Solomon, Joab has fled to the tent of LORD, and, behold, he is by the altar. Then Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, fall upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.30'>And Benaiah came to the tent of LORD, and said to him, Thus says the king, Come forth. And he said, No, but I will die here. And Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.31'>And the king said to him, Do as he has said, and fall upon him, and bury him, that thou may take away the blood, which Joab shed without cause, from me and from my father's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.32'>And LORD will return his blood upon his own head, because he fell upon two men more righteous and better than he, and killed them with the sword, and my father David did not know it, [namely], Abner the son of Ner, captain of the a</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.33'>So shall their blood return upon the head of Joab, and upon the head of his seed forever. But to David, and to his seed, and to his house, and to his throne, there shall be peace forever from LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.34'>Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up, and fell upon him, and killed him. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.35'>And the king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada in his room over the army. And the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.36'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Build for thee a house in Jerusalem, and dwell there, and go not forth from there anywhere.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.37'>For on the day thou go out, and pass over the brook Kidron, know thou for certain that thou shall surely die; thy blood shall be upon thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.38'>And Shimei said to the king, The saying is good. As my lord the king has said, so will thy servant do. And Shimei dwelt in Jerusalem many days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.39'>And it came to pass at the end of three years, that two of the servants of Shimei ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And they told Shimei, saying, Behold, thy servants are in Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.40'>And Shimei arose, and saddled his donkey, and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. And Shimei went, and brought his servants from Gath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.41'>And it was told Solomon that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath, and was come again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.42'>And the king sent and called for Shimei, and said to him, Did I not adjure thee by LORD, and protest to thee, saying, Know for certain, that on the day thou go out, and walk abroad anywhere, thou shall surely die? And thou said to</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.43'>Why then have thou not kept the oath of LORD, and the commandment that I have charged thee with?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.44'>The king said moreover to Shimei, Thou know all the iniquity which thy heart is privy to, what thou did to David my father. Therefore LORD shall return thy iniquity upon thine own head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.45'>But king Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before LORD forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.2.46'>So the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. And he went out, and fell upon him so that he died. And the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Kgs.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.1'>And Solomon made affinity with Pharaoh king of Egypt, and took Pharaoh's daughter, and brought her into the city of David until he had made an end of building his own house, and the house of LORD, and the wall of Jerusalem round ab</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.2'>Only the people sacrificed in the high places, because there was no house built for the name of LORD until those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.3'>And Solomon loved LORD, walking in the statutes of David his father. Only he sacrificed and burnt incense in the high places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.4'>And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon offered a thousand burnt-offerings upon that altar.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.6'>And Solomon said, Thou have shown to thy servant David my father great loving kindness, according as he walked before thee in truth, and in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart with thee. And thou have kept for him this great</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.10'>And the speech pleased LORD, that Solomon had asked this thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.11'>And God said to him, Because thou have asked this thing, and have not asked for thyself long life, neither have asked riches for thyself, nor have asked the life of thine enemies, but have asked for thyself understanding to discern</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.12'>behold, I have done according to thy word. Lo, I have given thee a wise and an understanding heart, so that there has been none like thee before thee, neither after thee shall any arise like thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.13'>And I have also given thee that which thou have not asked, both riches and honor, so that there shall not be any among the kings like thee all thy days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.3.14'>And if thou will walk in my ways, to keep my statutes and my commandments, as thy father David walked, then I will lengthen thy days.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.18'>Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who dwells in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth where he has gone down to take possession of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.19'>And thou shall speak to him, saying, Thus says LORD, Have thou killed and also taken possession? And thou shall speak to him, saying, Thus says LORD, In the place where dogs licked the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick thy blood, eve</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.20'>And Ahab said to Elijah, Have thou found me, O my enemy? And he answered, I have found thee because thou have sold thyself to do that which is evil in the sight of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.21'>Behold, I will bring evil upon thee, and will utterly sweep thee away and will cut off from Ahab every man-child, and he who is shut up and he who is left at large in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.22'>And I will make thy house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah for the provocation with which thou have provoked me to anger, and have made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.23'>And LORD spoke also of Jezebel, saying, The dogs shall eat Jezebel by the rampart of Jezreel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.24'>He who dies of Ahab in the city the dogs shall eat, and he who dies in the field shall the birds of the heavens eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.25'>(But there was none like Ahab, who sold himself to do that which was evil in the sight of LORD, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.26'>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all that the Amorites did whom LORD cast out before the sons of Israel.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.27'>And it came to pass, when Ahab heard those words, that he tore his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sackcloth, and went softly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.28'>And the word of LORD came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.21.29'>See thou how Ahab humbles himself before me? Because he humbles himself before me, I will not bring the evil in his days, but in his son's days will I bring the evil upon his house.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.1'>And they continued three years without war between Syria and Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.2'>And it came to pass in the third year, that Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.3'>And the king of Israel said to his servants, Know ye that Ramoth-gilead is ours, and we are still, and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.4'>And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will thou go with me to battle to Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as thou are, my people as thy people, my horses as thy horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.5'>And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first, I pray thee, for the word of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.6'>Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go against Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go up, for LORD will deliver it into the hand of the k</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.7'>But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of LORD besides, that we may inquire of him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.8'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of LORD, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he does not prophesy good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the kin</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.9'>Then the king of Israel called an officer, and said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.10'>Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting each on his throne, arrayed in their robes, in an open place at the entrance of the gate of Samaria. And all the prophets were prophesying before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.11'>And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for him horns of iron, and said, Thus says LORD, With these thou shall push the Syrians until they be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.12'>And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to Ramoth-gilead, and prosper, for LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.13'>And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, Behold now, the words of the prophets [declare] good to the king with one mouth. Let thy word, I pray thee, be like the word of one of them, and speak thou good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.14'>And Micaiah said, As LORD lives, what LORD says to me, that I will speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.15'>And when he came to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we forbear? And he answered him, Go up and prosper, and LORD will deliver it into the hand of the king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.16'>And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee that thou speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.17'>And he said, I saw all Israel scattered upon the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And LORD said, These have no master, let them return every man to his house in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.18'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell thee that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.19'>And [Micaiah] said, Therefore hear thou the word of LORD. I saw LORD sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing by him on his right hand and on his left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.20'>And LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said on this manner, and another said on that manner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.21'>And there came forth a spirit, and stood before LORD, and said, I will entice him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.22'>And LORD said to him, With what? And he said, I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, Thou shall entice him, and shall also prevail. Go forth, and do so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.23'>Now therefore, behold, LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these thy prophets, and LORD has spoken evil concerning thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.24'>Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote Micaiah on the cheek, and said, Which way did the Spirit of LORD go from me to speak to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.25'>And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shall see on that day when thou shall go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.26'>And the king of Israel said, Take Micaiah, and carry him back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.27'>and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in the prison, and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of affliction until I come in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.28'>And Micaiah said, If thou return at all in peace, LORD has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, ye peoples, all of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.29'>So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.30'>And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself, and go into the battle, but put thou on thy robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself, and went into the battle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.31'>Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, saying, Fight neither with small nor great, except only with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.32'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, that they said, Surely it is the king of Israel, and they turned aside to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.33'>And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, that they turned back from pursuing him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.34'>And a certain man drew his bow at a venture, and smote the king of Israel between the joints of the armor. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn thy hand, and carry me out of the army, for I am severely wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.35'>And the battle increased that day. And the king was propped up in his chariot against the Syrians. And he died at evening, and the blood ran out of the wound into the bottom of the chariot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.36'>And there went a cry throughout the army about the going down of the sun, saying, Every man to his city, and every man to his country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.37'>So the king died, and was brought to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.38'>And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood (now the harlots washed themselves [there]), according to the word of LORD which he spoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.39'>Now the rest of the acts of Ahab, and all that he did, and the ivory house which he built, and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Israel?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.40'>So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.41'>And Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.42'>Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.43'>And he walked in all the way of Asa his father. He turned not aside from it, doing that which was right in the eyes of LORD. However the high places were not taken away; the people still sacrificed and burnt incense in the high pla</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.44'>And Jehoshaphat made peace with the king of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.45'>Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of Judah?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.46'>And he put away out of the land the remnant of the sodomites, who remained in the days of his father Asa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.47'>And there was no king in Edom; a deputy was king.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.48'>Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were broken at Ezion-geber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.49'>Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with thy servants in the ships. But Jehoshaphat would not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.50'>And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father. And Jehoram his son reigned in his stead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.51'>Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.52'>And he did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and walked in the way of his father, and in the way of his mother, and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, how he made Israel to sin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Kgs.22.53'>And he served Baal, and worshipped him, and provoked to anger LORD, the God of Israel, according to all that his father had done.</verse>
