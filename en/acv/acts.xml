      <chapter osisID='Acts.1'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.1'>I indeed made the former treatise, O Theophilus, about all things that Jesus began both to do and to teach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.2'>until a day in which he was taken up, having commanded, through Holy Spirit, the apostles whom he chose,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.3'>to whom he also presented himself living, after his suffering, by many infallible proofs, being seen by them during forty days, and speaking the things about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.4'>And being assembled together, he commanded them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, Which, he said, ye heard from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.5'>Because John indeed immersed in water, but ye will be immersed in Holy Spirit after not many of these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.6'>Indeed therefore having come together, they questioned him, saying, Lord, do thou restore the kingdom to Israel at this time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.7'>And he said to them, It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father established in his own authority.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.8'>But ye will receive the power of the Holy Spirit that comes upon you. And ye will be witnesses to me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and as far as of the extremity of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.9'>And having said these things, as they were watching, he was taken up, and a cloud received him from their eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.10'>And while they were gazing at his going into the sky, behold, two men had also stood by them in white apparel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.11'>who also said, Men, Galileans, why stand ye gazing into the sky? This Jesus who was taken up from you into the sky will so come, in that same way as ye saw him going into the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.12'>Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mountain called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem having a Sabbath day journey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.13'>And when they came in, they went up into the upper floor where they were lodging, including, Peter and James and John and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Juda</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.14'>All these men were continuing with one accord in prayer and supplication, with women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.15'>And in those days, Peter, having stood up in the midst of the disciples (and there was a multitude of names at the same place, about a hundred twenty), he said</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.16'>Men, brothers, it was necessary for this Scripture to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit foretold through the mouth of David about Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.17'>because he was numbered with us, and received a share of this ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.18'>(Indeed therefore this man obtained a field from the reward of his unrighteousness, and having become headlong, he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.19'>And it became known to all those dwelling at Jerusalem, so as to call that field in their own dialect, Akeldama, that is, The field of blood.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.20'>For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation become desolate, and let no man be dwelling in it, and, Let another take his office.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.21'>It is necessary therefore, of the men who accompanied us during all the time during which the Lord Jesus went in and went out among us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.22'>having begun from the immersion of John to the day that he was taken up from us, for one of these to become a witness with us of his resurrection.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.23'>And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.24'>And having prayed, they said, Thou, Lord, knowing the hearts of all men, show which one of these two thou have chosen</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.25'>to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas transgressed to go to his own place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.1.26'>And they gave their lots, and the lot fell upon Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.2'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.1'>And while fulfilling the day of Pentecost, they were all together at the same place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.2'>And suddenly there developed a sound from the sky as of a forceful wind moving, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.3'>And there appeared to them dividing tongues, as of fire, and they settled upon each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.4'>And they were all filled of Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them to declare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.5'>Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem, Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.6'>And the sound of this that happened brought the multitude together. And it was bewildered because each one heard them speaking in his own language.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.7'>And they were amazed and marveled, saying to each other, Behold, are not all these men who speak Galileans?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.8'>And how do we each hear our own language in which we were born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.9'>Parthians and Medes and Elamites, and those dwelling in Mesopotamia, and Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.10'>and Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya along Cyrene, and those Roman aliens, including Jews and proselytes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.11'>Cretes and Arabians. We hear them speaking in our tongues the great things of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.12'>And they were all amazed, and were perplexed, others saying to others, Whatever does this intend to be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.13'>But others, mocking said, They are filled of wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.14'>But Peter having stood up with the eleven, raised his voice and spoke out to them, saying, Jewish men, and all who dwell at Jerusalem, be this known to you, and listen to my sayings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.15'>For these men are not drunken, as ye suppose, for it is the third hour of the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.16'>But this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.17'>And it will be in the last days, says God, I will pour out from my Spirit upon all flesh. And your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men will see visions, and your elders will dream dreams.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.18'>And also on my bondmen and on my bondmaids in those days I will pour out from my Spirit, and they will prophesy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.19'>And I will give wonders in the heaven above, and signs on the earth beneath, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.20'>The sun will be changed into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and wonderful day of Lord comes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.21'>And it will be, that every man, whoever may call on the name of Lord will be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.22'>Men, Israelites, hear ye these words. Jesus the Nazarene, a man shown by God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.23'>this man, having been designated (by the purpose and foreknowledge of God) a man delivered up, ye, having taken by lawless hands, killed, having crucified,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.24'>whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.25'>For David speaks for him: I beheld the Lord always before me, because he is at my right hand, so that I may not be moved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.26'>Because of this my heart rejoiced, and my tongue was glad. And moreover my flesh will also rest in hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.27'>Because thou will not leave my soul in Hades, nor will thou give thy Holy man to see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.28'>Thou made known to me the paths of life. Thou will fill me of joy with thy countenance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.29'>Men, brothers, being permitted to speak to you with openness about the patriarch David, that he both perished and was buried, and his sepulcher is with us to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.30'>Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, to raise the Christ from the fruit of his loins according to flesh to sit upon his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.31'>Having foreseen this, he spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that his soul was not left behind in Hades, nor did his flesh see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.32'>This Jesus, God raised up, of which we are all witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.33'>Therefore, exalted by the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, he poured out this that ye now see and hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.34'>For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.35'>until I place thine enemies a footstool of thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.36'>Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God has made him, this Jesus whom ye crucified, both Lord and Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.37'>Now having heard this, they were pierced in the heart, and said to Peter and the other apostles, Men, brothers, what will we do?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.38'>And Peter said to them, Repent ye, and be immersed each of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.39'>For the promise is to you, and to your children, and to all those in afar, as many as Lord our God may call.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.40'>And with many more other words he testified and exhorted them, saying, Be saved from this crooked generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.41'>Indeed therefore those who received his word gladly, were immersed. And there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.42'>And they were continuing steadfastly in the apostles doctrine, and in fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and the prayers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.43'>And fear developed in every soul. And many wonders and signs occurred through the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.44'>And all who believed were together, and had all things common.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.45'>And they sold properties and possessions, and divided them to all, according as any man had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.46'>And continuing steadfastly, daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, they partook of nourishment in gladness and evenness of heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.2.47'>praising God, and having favor with the whole populace. And the Lord was adding to the church daily those being saved.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.3'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.1'>Now at the same time Peter and John were going up into the temple, at the hour of prayer, the ninth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.2'>And a certain man, being lame from his mother's belly, was carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple, called Beautiful, to ask charity from those who entered into the temple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.3'>who, having seen Peter and John intending to go into the temple, asked charity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.4'>And Peter, having gazed intently at him, with John, said, Look at us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.5'>And he gave attention to them expecting to receive something from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.6'>But Peter said, No silver and gold exists to me, but what I have, this I give thee. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, rise up and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.7'>And after taking him by the right hand, he lifted him up. And immediately his feet and his ankles were strengthened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.8'>And leaping up, he stood and walked. And he entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.9'>And all the people saw him walking and praising God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.10'>and they recognized him, that this was the man who sat for charity at the Beautiful Gate of the temple. And they were filled of astonishment and amazement at that which happened to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.11'>And as the lame man who was healed held Peter and John, all the people ran together to them in the porch that is called Solomon's, amazed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.12'>And Peter having seen, he responded to the people, Men, Israelites, why do ye marvel at this man? Or why do ye stare at us, as by our own power or piety we have made him to walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.13'>The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, has glorified his Boy Jesus, whom ye actually delivered up and denied him in the presence of Pilate who preferred to release that man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.14'>But ye denied the Holy and Righteous, and asked for a man, a murderer to be granted to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.15'>And ye killed the Pathfinder of life, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.16'>And by faith in his name, this man whom ye see and know, his name has made strong. And faith through him has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.17'>And now, brothers, I know that ye did it from ignorance, as also your rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.18'>But this way God fulfilled what things were foretold, through the mouth of all his prophets, the Christ was to endure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.19'>Repent ye therefore, and be converted in order to wipe away your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.20'>And he may send Christ Jesus who has been pre-ordained for you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.21'>whom heaven must indeed receive until the times of restoration of all things, of which God spoke through the mouth of all his holy prophets from the age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.22'>For Moses indeed said to the fathers, Lord our God will raise up a prophet for you, from your brothers, like me. Ye shall hear him in all things, as many as he might speak to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.23'>And every soul, whichever it will be, if it will not hear that prophet will be utterly destroyed from the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.24'>And also all the prophets from Samuel and those in succession, as many as spoke, also proclaimed these days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.25'>Ye are sons of the prophets, and of the covenant that God made for our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy seed all the patriarchies of the earth will be blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.3.26'>To you first, having raised up his Boy Jesus, God sent him blessing you, in turning away each man from your evils.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.4'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.1'>And as they spoke to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees approached them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.2'>being greatly annoyed because of their teaching the people, and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection of the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.3'>And they threw hands on them, and put them in custody for the morrow, for it was now evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.4'>But many of those who heard the word believed, and the number of the men became about five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.5'>And it came to pass on the morrow, to be assembled in Jerusalem, their rulers, and elders, and scholars,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.6'>and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the high priestly family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.7'>And after placing them in the midst, they inquired, By what power, or in what name, have ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.8'>Then Peter being filled with Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people, and elders of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.9'>if we are examined today about a good deed, of a feeble man, by what this man has been healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.10'>be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, by this, this man stands here before you healthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.11'>This is the stone that was rejected by you who build, which became into the head of the corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.12'>And salvation is not in any other man, for there is no other name under the heaven, that has been given among men, by which we must be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.13'>Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and having perceived that they are illiterate and uneducated men, they marveled. And they recognized them, that they had been with Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.14'>And seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they had nothing to contradict.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.15'>But after commanding them to go outside of the council, they conferred among each other,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.16'>saying, What will we do to these men? For that indeed a notable sign has happened by them, is apparent to all who dwell in Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.17'>But that it may not spread on further among the people, let us threaten them with threats to speak no longer in this name, to not one man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.18'>And having called them, they commanded them entirely, not to utter nor to teach in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.19'>But Peter and John having replied to them, they said, Whether it is right in the sight of God to hearken to you rather than God, judge ye.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.20'>For we are not able not to speak what we saw and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.21'>And they, having further threatened, released them, finding nothing how they might punish them, because of the people. Since all glorified God for that which happened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.22'>For the man was more than forty years old on whom this sign of healing had occurred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.23'>And after being released, they went to their own men, and reported as many things as the chief priests and the elders said to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.24'>And those who heard lifted up a voice to God with one accord, and said, Thou Master, the God who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all things in them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.25'>He who said through the mouth of thy boy David, Why do the nations rage, and the peoples meditate vain things?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.26'>The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord, and against his Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.27'>For in truth, against thy holy Boy Jesus, whom thou anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, were gathered together,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.28'>to do as many things as thy hand and thy purpose predetermined to happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.29'>And now, Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.30'>by thy stretching forth thy hand for healing, and signs and wonders to happen through the name of thy holy Boy Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.31'>And when they prayed, the place in which they were assembled was shaken, and they were all filled with Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.32'>And the multitude of those who believed were of one heart and soul. And not even one man said that anything of the things that was possessed by him was his own, but all things were common to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.33'>And with great power the apostles gave back the testimony of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.34'>For not even any needy was among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses, selling, they brought the proceeds of the things that were sold,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.35'>and placed them at the apostles' feet. And it was distributed to each, according as any man had need.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.36'>And Joses, who was surnamed by the apostles, Barnabas (which is, being translated, son of encouragement), a Levite, a Cypriot by nationality,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.4.37'>having sold a field that was possessed by him, brought the money and placed it at the apostles' feet.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.5'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.1'>But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold property,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.2'>and kept back from the price, his wife also having joint awareness. And having brought a certain part, he placed it at the apostles' feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.3'>But Peter said, Ananias, why did Satan fill thy heart for thee to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back from the price of the land?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.4'>While it remained, did it not remain to thee? And after it was sold, it was in thine authority. Why is it that thou have placed this matter in thy heart? Thou have not lied to men, but to God.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.5.23'>saying, We found the prison indeed shut in all security, and the guards standing before the doors, but after opening, we found no man inside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.5.24'>Now when they heard these words, the high priest, and the captain of the temple, and the chief priests, were perplexed about them, whatever this would become.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.9.2'>he requested letters from him for Damascus, to the synagogues, so that if he found any who were of the Way, both men and women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.3'>And on going, it came to pass for him to approach Damascus. And suddenly there shone around him a light out of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.4'>And after falling to the ground, he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why do thou persecute me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.5'>And he said, Who are thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom thou persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.6'>But arise, and enter into the city, and it will be told thee what thou must do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.7'>And the men who traveled with him had stopped, speechless, indeed hearing the voice, but seeing no man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.8'>And Saul arose from the ground. And when his eyes were opened, he saw no man. But they brought him into Damascus, leading him by the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.9'>And he was three days not seeing, and did not eat or drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.10'>Now there was a certain disciple in Damascus, named Ananias, and the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold me, Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.11'>And the Lord said to him, After rising, go into the street called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas, a man named Saul of Tarsus, for behold, he is praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.12'>And he saw in a vision a man named Ananias who came in and laid a hand on him, so that he might receive sight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.13'>But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how many evil things he did to thy sanctified at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.14'>And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call upon thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.15'>But the Lord said to him, Go, because this man is a chosen vessel to me, to bear my name before Gentiles and kings, and sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.16'>For I will give him a glimpse of how many things it is necessary for him to suffer for my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.17'>And Ananias departed and entered into the house. And having laid hands on him he said, Brother Saul, the Lord, he who appeared to thee on the road on which thou came, has sent me so that thou may receive sight, and be filled of Hol</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.18'>And straightaway there fell from his eyes, like scales, and he looked up. And immediately after rising up, he was immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.19'>And having received nourishment, he was strengthened. And Saul became with the disciples in Damascus some days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.20'>And straightaway he proclaimed the Christ in the synagogues, that this man is the Son of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.21'>And all those who heard were amazed, and said, Is this not the man who destroyed those in Jerusalem who call on this name? And he has come here for this, so that he might bring them bound to the chief priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.22'>But Saul was strengthened more, and was confounding the Jews who dwell at Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.23'>And after considerable days were fulfilled, the Jews plotted to destroy him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.24'>but their plot was known to Saul. And they watched the gates both day and night so that they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.25'>But the disciples, after taking him by night, let him down through the wall, having lowered him in a hamper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.26'>And when Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he attempted to join with the disciples, and they all feared him, not believing that he is a disciple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.27'>But Barnabas having taken him, he brought him to the apostles. And he related to them how he saw the Lord on the road, and that he spoke to him, and how he spoke boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.28'>And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem, and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.29'>And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists, but they attempted to destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.30'>But when the brothers knew it, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him away to Tarsus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.31'>Indeed therefore the congregations throughout the whole of Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified. And, going in the fear of the Lord and in the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, they were multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.32'>And it came to pass, Peter, passing through all parts, to also come down to the sanctified who dwell at Lydda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.33'>And he found there a certain man named Aeneas, who was paralyzed, laying on a bed for eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.34'>And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus the Christ heals thee. Arise and make thy bed. And straightaway he arose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.35'>And all those dwelling at Lydda and Sharon who saw him, turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.36'>Now at Joppa there was a certain disciple named Tabitha, which, being translated, is called Dorcas. This woman was full of good works and charities that she did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.37'>And in those days, having been ill, she happened to died. And after washing her, they laid her in an upper chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.38'>And since Lydda is near Joppa, the disciples, having heard that Peter is in it, they sent two men to him, exhorting him not to delay to go through to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.39'>And after rising, Peter went with them, whom, after coming, they brought into the upper chamber. And all the widows stood by him weeping, and exhibiting the coats and garments, as many things as Dorcas made being with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.40'>But Peter, having sent them all out, having knelt down, he prayed. And having turned to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And the woman opened her eyes. And when she saw Peter, she sat up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.41'>And having given her a hand, he raised her up. And after calling the sanctified and the widows, he presented her alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.42'>And it became known throughout the whole of Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.9.43'>And it came to pass for him to remain considerable days at Joppa with a certain Simon, a tanner.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.10'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.1'>Now a certain man was in Caesarea, Cornelius by name, a centurion of the band called Italian,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.2'>a devout man, and fearing God with all his house, and doing many charities for the people, and beseeching God always.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.3'>He saw plainly in a vision about the ninth hour of the day, an agent of God coming in to him, and saying to him, Cornelius.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.4'>And after gazing at him, and having become afraid, he said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers and thy charities have come up for a memorial before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.5'>And now send men to Joppa and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.6'>This man lodges with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is beside the seaside.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.7'>And when the heavenly agent speaking to Cornelius departed, having called two of his housemen, and a devout soldier of those who personally served him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.8'>and after reporting all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.9'>Now on the morrow, while those men were traveling and approaching the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray, about the sixth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.10'>And he became very hungry and wanted to eat. But while those men prepared, a trance fell upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.11'>And he sees heaven opened, and a certain container descending to him, like a great sheet bound at four corners, and being lowered to the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.12'>in which were all the four-footed things of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.13'>And a voice came to him, After rising, Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.14'>But Peter said, Not so, Lord, because I have never eaten anything profane or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.15'>And a voice again for a second time, What God has cleansed, thou shall not make profane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.16'>And this happened thrice, and again the vessel was taken up into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.17'>Now while Peter was bewildered in himself whatever the vision which he saw might be, that lo, the men who were sent from Cornelius, having inquired the house of Simon, stood at the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.18'>And after calling out they asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodges here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.19'>And while Peter thought about the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, men seek thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.20'>But after rising, go down, and go with them, doubting nothing, because I have sent them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.21'>And having gone down to the men, Peter said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek. What is the cause for which ye are here?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.22'>And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man, and fearing God, and being well testified by the whole nation of the Jews, was divinely warned by a holy agent to summon thee to his house, and to hear sayings from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.23'>So, having invited them in, he lodged them. And on the morrow Peter went forth with them, and certain of the brothers from Joppa went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.24'>And on the morrow they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, having called together his kinsmen and close friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.25'>And when it came about for Peter to enter, Cornelius, having met him, after falling down at his feet, worshiped.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.26'>But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up. I am also myself a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.27'>And as he conversed with him, he went in and found many who came together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.28'>And he said to them, Ye understand how it is unlawful for a Jewish man to fraternize or to visit with a foreign man, and yet God demonstrated to me not to call one man profane or unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.29'>And so I came without objection when summoned. I ask therefore for what matter ye summoned me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.30'>And Cornelius said, Four days ago I was fasting until this hour, and the ninth hour praying in my house. And behold, a man stood before me in bright apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.31'>And he says, Cornelius, thy prayer was heard, and thy charities are remembered before God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.32'>Send therefore to Joppa, and summon Simon, who is surnamed Peter. This man lodges in the house of Simon, a tanner, beside the sea, who, after coming, will speak to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.33'>Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and thou did well having come. Now therefore we are all present in the sight of God, to hear all the things commanded thee by God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.34'>And having opened his mouth, Peter said, In truth, I am overwhelmed that God is not partial,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.35'>but in every nation, he who fears him, and works righteousness, is acceptable to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.36'>The word that he sent forth to the sons of Israel, preaching good-news, peace by Jesus Christ (this man is Lord of all),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.37'>ye know, the word having occurred throughout the whole of Judea beginning from Galilee after the immersion that John preached--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.38'>Jesus of Nazareth--how God anointed him with Holy Spirit and with power, who passed through doing good, and healing all those who were oppressed by the devil, because God was with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.39'>And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews, and in Jerusalem, whom also they killed, having hung on a tree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.40'>This man God raised up the third day, and granted him to become manifest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.41'>not to all the people, but to witnesses who were previously chosen by God, to us, who ate and drank with him after he arose from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.42'>And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to solemnly testify that this is the man designated by God, Judge of the living and the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.43'>To this man all the prophets testify, that every man who believes in him, to receive remission of sins through his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.44'>While Peter still spoke these sayings, the Holy Spirit fell on all those who heard the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.45'>And the faithful men of circumcision were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because also on the Gentiles the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.46'>For they heard them speaking in tongues and magnifying God. Then Peter answered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.47'>Can any man forbid the water for these not to be immersed, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.10.48'>And he commanded them to be immersed in the name of the Lord. Then they asked him to remain some days.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.11'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.1'>Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the Gentiles also received the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.2'>And when Peter came up to Jerusalem, the men of circumcision contended against him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.3'>saying, Thou went in to uncircumcised men, having also eaten with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.4'>But when Peter began, he expounded to them in order, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.5'>I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain container descending, as a great sheet being lowered from heaven by four corners, and it came as far as to me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.6'>having gazed at which, I was examining. And I saw the four footed things of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping things, and the birds of the sky.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.7'>And I heard a voice saying to me, Having risen, Peter, kill and eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.8'>But I said, Not so, Lord, because nothing profane or unclean has ever entered into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.9'>But a voice answered me for a second time out of heaven, What God has cleansed, thou shall not make profane.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.10'>And this happened thrice, and all were drawn up again into heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.11'>And behold, immediately three men stood at the house in which I was, who were sent from Caesarea to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.12'>And the Spirit told me to go with them, doubting nothing. And these six brothers also went with me, and we entered into the man's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.13'>And he informed us how he saw the heavenly agent in his house, who stood and said to him, Send forth men to Joppa, and summon Simon, the man surnamed Peter,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.14'>who will speak sayings to thee, by which thou will be saved, thou and all thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.15'>And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as also on us at the beginning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.16'>And I remembered the saying of Lord, how he said, John indeed immersed in water, but ye will be immersed in Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.17'>If then God gave to them the identical gift as also to us who believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, but what power was I to hinder God?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.18'>And when they heard these things, they relaxed and glorified God, saying, Then God has also granted to the Gentiles repentance to life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.19'>Indeed therefore those who were scattered abroad from the persecution that occurred against Stephen passed through as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to none except Jews only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.20'>And some of them were men, Cyprians and Cyrenians, who, having come to Antioch, spoke to the Hellenists, preaching good-news, the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.21'>And the hand of Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.22'>And the word about them was heard in the ears of the church at Jerusalem, and they dispatched Barnabas to pass through as far as Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.23'>who, having arrived, and having seen the grace of God, rejoiced. And he encouraged all, with purpose of heart, to remain in the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.24'>Because he was a good man, and full of Holy Spirit and of faith. And a considerable multitude was added to the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.25'>And Barnabus departed to Tarsus to seek Saul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.26'>and when he found him, he brought him to Antioch. And it came to pass a whole year for them to be assembled in the congregation, and to teach a considerable multitude, and to call the disciples Christians, first at Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.27'>Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.28'>And one of them named Agabus, after standing up, signified by the Spirit there was going be a great famine in the whole world, which also happened under Claudius Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.29'>And the disciples, as any man prospered, determined, each of them regarding aid, to send to the brothers who dwell in Judea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.11.30'>which also they did, having sent it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.12'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.1'>Now about that time Herod the king threw on hands to harm some of those from the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.2'>And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.3'>And after seeing that it was pleasing the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also (and those were the days of unleavened bread),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.4'>whom, having also arrested, he put in prison, having delivered to four quaternions of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.5'>Indeed therefore Peter was kept in the prison, but fervent prayer was being made by the church to God for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.6'>And when Herod was about to bring him forth, that night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound by two chains. And guards in front of the door guarded the prison.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.7'>And behold, an agent of Lord stood near, and light shone in the room. And after striking the side of Peter, he raised him up, saying, Get up quickly. And his chains fell off from his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.8'>And the agent said to him, Gird thyself, and tie on thy sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Throw on thy garment, and follow me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.9'>And after going out, he followed him. And he had not seen that the thing happening by the heavenly agent was true, but presumed to see a vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.10'>And when they passed a first and a second watch, they came to the iron gate, the one leading to the city, which opened spontaneously to them. And after going out, they advanced one street. And straightaway the agent withdrew from h</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.11'>And when Peter came to himself, he said, Now I know truly, that Lord dispatched his agent and delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and all the expectation of the people of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.12'>And having realized it, he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, surnamed Mark, where a considerable were gathered and praying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.13'>And when Peter knocked the door of the gate, a servant girl named Rhoda came to hearken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.14'>And after recognizing Peter's voice, she did not open the gate for joy, but having ran in, she reported Peter was standing in front of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.15'>And they said to her, Thou are mad. But she insisted to have it so. But they said, It is his heavenly agent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.16'>But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him, and were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.17'>But after motioning to them with the hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord brought him out of the prison. And he said, Report these things to James, and to the brothers. And having departed, he went to a different pl</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.18'>But having become day, there was no small stir among the soldiers what then became of Peter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.19'>And Herod, who sought for him, and not having found, having examined the guards, he commanded them to be led away. And going down from Judea to Caesarea, he remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.20'>Now Herod was angry at the Tyrians and Sidonians. But they came with one accord to him, and, having persuaded Blastus the man over the king's bedchamber, they requested peace, because their country was sustained from the monarchy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.21'>And at a set day Herod, having arrayed himself in royal apparel, and having sat on the tribunal, he made an oration to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.22'>And the populace shouted, The voice of a god, and not of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.23'>And immediately an agent of Lord struck him, because he did not give glory to God. And after becoming worm-eaten, he expired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.24'>But the word of God grew and multiplied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.12.25'>And Barnabas and Saul turned back in Jerusalem after fulfilling the service, also having taken along John who was surnamed Mark.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.13'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.1'>Now there were some men from the congregation that was in Antioch, prophets and teachers, including Barnabas, and Simeon called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen reared with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.2'>And while they were serving the Lord, and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Separate to me now Barnabas and Saul for the work that I have called them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.3'>Then, having fasted and prayed and laid hands on them, they sent them away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.4'>Indeed therefore these men, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed for Cyprus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.5'>And after becoming in Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews, and they also had John for a helper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.6'>And after going through the island as far as Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a Jewish FALSE prophet, whose name was Bar-jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.7'>who was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man. This man, having summoned Barnabas and Saul, sought to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.8'>But Elymas the sorcerer (for so his name is translated) opposed them, seeking to deviate the proconsul from the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.9'>But Saul (the man is also Paul) having been filled with Holy Spirit, and having gazed on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.10'>said, O man full of all deceit and all recklessness, thou son of the devil, thou enemy of all righteousness, will thou not cease distorting the straight ways of Lord?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.11'>And now, behold, a hand of Lord is upon thee, and thou will be blind, not seeing the sun until a time. And immediately there fell on him gloom and darkness, and going around he sought hand-guides.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.12'>Then the proconsul, who saw that which happened, believed, being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.13'>Now those around Paul, having launched from Paphos, they came to Perga in Pamphylia. But John, having departed from them, returned to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.14'>And they, having passed through from Perga, arrived at Antioch of Pisidia, and after entering into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, they sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.15'>And after the reading of the law and the prophets the synagogue rulers sent to them, saying, Men, brothers, if there is among you a word of exhortation for the people, speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.16'>And Paul having stood up, and having motioned with the hand, he said, Men, Israelites, and those who fear God, listen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.17'>The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and raised up the people during the sojourn in the land of Egypt. And with a lofty arm he brought them out of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.18'>And for about a forty-year time he was patient with them in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.19'>And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan, he allotted their land to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.20'>And after these things he gave them judges about four hundred and fifty years until Samuel the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.21'>And afterward they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.22'>And having removed him, he raised up David for a king to them, also about whom he said, when he testified, I have found David the son of Jesse, a man according to my heart, who will do all my purposes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.23'>From this man's seed according to promise, God brought salvation to Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.24'>John having earlier proclaimed, before his coming presence, the immersion of repentance to Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.25'>And as John was fulfilling his course, he said, Whom do ye suppose me to be? I am not, but behold, he comes after me of whom I am not worthy to loose the shoes of his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.26'>Men, brothers, sons of the race of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to you the word of this salvation was sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.27'>For those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not having known this and the voices of the prophets being read at every Sabbath, they fulfilled, having condemned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.28'>And not having found one cause of death in him, they asked for Pilate to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.29'>And when they completed all the things written about him, having taken him down from the tree, they laid him in a tomb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.30'>But God raised him from the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.31'>who was seen for more days by those who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are witnesses of him to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.32'>And we proclaim good-news to you: the promise to the fathers, which happened because God has fulfilled this to us their children, having raised up Jesus,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.33'>as also it is written in the second psalm, Thou are my Son, today I have begotten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.34'>And because he raised him from the dead, no longer going to return to decay, he has spoken this way: I will give to you the faithful holy things of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.35'>Therefore also he says in another, Thou will not give thy Holy man to see decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.36'>For indeed David, who served his own generation in the plan of God, became asleep, and was added near his fathers, and saw decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.37'>But he whom God raised up saw no decay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.38'>Be it known to you therefore, men, brothers, that through this man remission of sins is proclaimed to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.39'>And from all things of which ye could not be make righteous by the Law of Moses, in this man every man who believes is made righteous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.40'>Watch therefore, lest that which is spoken in the prophets should come upon you:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.41'>Behold, ye scoffers, and wonder, and perish, because I work a work in your days, which ye would, no, not believe, if some man should fully narrate it to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.42'>And as they went out from the synagogue of the Jews, the Gentiles urged that these sayings be spoken to them the next Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.43'>Now after the synagogue was dismissed, many of the Jews and of the devout proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas, who, while conversing, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.44'>And on the coming Sabbath almost all the city was assembled to hear the word of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.45'>But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled of envy, and contradicted the things spoken by Paul, contradicting and slandering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.46'>But having spoken boldly, Paul and Barnabas said, It was necessary for the word of God to be spoken first to you, but since ye thrust it away, and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.47'>For so the Lord has commanded us: I have placed thee for a light of Gentiles, for thee to be for salvation as far as the extremity of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.48'>And hearing this, the Gentiles were glad and glorified the word of the Lord. And as many as were appointed for eternal life believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.49'>And the word of the Lord was spread abroad through the whole region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.50'>But the Jews incited the religious women, and the prominent women, and the principle men of the city, and raised up a persecution against Paul and Barnabas. And they threw them out of their boundaries.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.51'>But after shaking off the dust of their feet against them, they came to Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.13.52'>And the disciples were filled with joy and Holy Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.14'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.1'>And it came to pass in Iconium according to the same thing, for them to enter into the synagogue of the Jews, and to speak so as for a great quantity to believe, both of Jews and of Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.2'>But the disobedient Jews aroused the souls of the Gentiles, and made them evil against the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.3'>Indeed therefore they remained a considerable time speaking boldly in the Lord--him testifying to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to occur by their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.4'>But the majority of the city was divided, and verily there were those with the Jews, and those with the apostles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.5'>And as a violent movement developed, both of the Gentiles and of the Jews, with their rulers, to denounce and to stone them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.6'>having become aware of it, they fled to the cities of Lycaonia, Lystra, and Derbe, and the neighboring region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.7'>And there they were preaching the good-news.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.8'>And a certain man was sitting in Lystra, disabled in his feet, being a cripple from his mother's belly, who had never walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.9'>This man was listening to Paul speaking, who, having gazed at him, and having seen that he has faith to be healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.10'>said with a great voice, Stand correctly on thy feet. And he leaped up and walked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.11'>And the multitudes who saw what Paul did, lifted up their voice, speaking Lycaonian, The gods came down to us, having become like men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.12'>And they actually called Barnabas, Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the man who led the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.13'>And the priest of Zeus, being in front of their city, after bringing oxen and garlands to the gates, wanted to sacrifice with the multitudes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.14'>But when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard, having torn their garments, they rushed into the crowd, crying out</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.15'>and saying, Men, why are ye doing these things? We also are men of like nature with you, proclaiming good-news to you, to turn from these vain things to the living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all the thi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.16'>who in the generations that have passed allowed all the nations to go in their own ways,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.17'>although he did not leave himself without evidence, doing good and giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts of food and gladness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.18'>And saying these things, they scarcely restrained the multitudes not to sacrifice to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.19'>But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium. And having persuaded the crowds, and having stoned Paul, they dragged him out of the city, after presuming him to be dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.20'>But the disciples having surrounded him, after rising, he came into the city. And on the morrow he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.21'>And having preached the good-news to that city, and having made considerable disciples, they returned to Lystra, and to Iconium, and to Antioch,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.22'>strengthening the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that it was necessary for us to enter into the kingdom of God through many tribulations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.23'>And having appointed elders for them in every congregation, having prayed with fasting, they entrusted them to the Lord, in whom they had believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.24'>And after passing through Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.25'>And when they spoke the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.26'>and from there they sailed to Antioch, from where they were delivered to the grace of God for the work that they fulfilled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.14.27'>And after arriving, and after gathering the assembly together, they reported as many things as God did with them, and that he opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.15'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.1'>And certain men, who came down from Judea, taught the brothers, Unless ye will be circumcised in the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.2'>Therefore, no small dissension and debate having developed with Paul and Barnabus against them, they appointed Paul and Barnabas, and some other men from them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem about thi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.3'>Indeed therefore, having been helped for the trip by the congregation, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles. And they caused great joy to all the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.4'>And after arriving in Jerusalem, they were received by the church and the apostles and the elders. And they reported as many things as God did with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.5'>But some of the men who believed from the sect of the Pharisees rose up, saying, It is necessary to circumcise them, and to command them to keep the law of Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.6'>And the apostles and the elders were assembled together to see about this matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.7'>And when much debate occurred, Peter having risen up, he said to them, Men, brothers, ye know that from past days among us, God chose the Gentiles to hear through my mouth the word of the good-news, and to believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.8'>And God, who knows the heart, testified to them, having given them the Holy Spirit, just as also to us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.9'>And he made not one distinction between both us and them, having purified their hearts by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.10'>Now therefore why do ye challenge God, to place a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.11'>But through the grace of the Lord Jesus, we believe to be saved, in the same way as those men also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.12'>And all the multitude kept silent, and they heard Barnabas and Paul describing how many signs and wonders God did among the Gentiles through them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.13'>And after they were quiet, James answered, saying, Men, brothers, hear me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.14'>Simeon described how God first came to help, to take from the Gentiles a people for his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.15'>And to this the words of the prophets agree, as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.16'>After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David that has fallen. And I will rebuild the things of it that have been demolished, and I will restore it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.17'>so that the rest of men might seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles upon whom my name is called upon them, says the Lord, who does these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.18'>Known to God from the age are all his works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.19'>Therefore I judge not to trouble those from the Gentiles who are turning to God,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.20'>but to write to them, to abstain from the pollutions of idols, and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.21'>For Moses from generations past, has from city to city those who preach him, being read in the synagogues on every Sabbath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.22'>Then it was decided by the apostles and the elders, with the whole assembly, to send men chosen from them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas, namely, Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.23'>after writing by their hand these things:The apostles, and the elders, and the brothers, to those down in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, to the brothers of the Gentiles, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.24'>Since we have heard that certain men who went out from us have troubled you with words, disturbing your souls, saying to be circumcised, and to keep the law, to whom we did not command,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.26'>men who have given over their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.27'>We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, themselves also declaring the same things by speech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.28'>For it was decided by the Holy Spirit, and by us, to lay upon you not one greater burden than these necessary things:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.29'>to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, keeping yourselves from which, ye will do well. Be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.30'>Indeed therefore after being dismissed, they came to Antioch, and having gathered the multitude together, they delivered the letter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.31'>And after reading it, they rejoiced for the encouragement.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.32'>And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets, exhorted the brothers by much speech, and strengthened them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.33'>And after spending some time, they were dismissed with peace from the brothers to the apostles.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.15.35'>But Paul and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching good-news, the word of the Lord, with many others also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.36'>And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, After returning, surely we could help our brothers in every city in which we proclaimed the word of the Lord, how they fare.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.37'>And Barnabas wanted to take along John called Mark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.38'>But Paul thought it not worthy to bring along this man who withdrew from them from Pamphylia, and not having gone with them to the work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.39'>Therefore a provocation developed, so as for them to separate from each other, and Barnabas to sail for Cyprus, after taking Mark,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.40'>but Paul, having selected Silas, went forth after being delivered to the grace of God by the brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.15.41'>And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, encouraging the congregations.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.16'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.1'>And he came to Derbe and to Lystra. And behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a certain faithful Jewish woman, but of a Greek father,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.2'>who was well reported of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.3'>Paul wanted this man to go forth with him. And having taken him, he circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those regions, for they had all seen that his father was a Greek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.4'>And as they were going through the cities, they delivered to them the decrees to keep, which were determined by the apostles and elders at Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.5'>Indeed therefore the congregations were strengthened in the faith, and increased in number daily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.6'>But having passed through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.7'>having come toward Mysia, they attempted to go toward Bithynia. And the Spirit did not allow them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.8'>And after passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.9'>And a vision appeared to Paul during the night. A certain Macedonian man was standing, imploring him, and saying, After crossing over into Macedonia, help us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.11'>Therefore, having launched from Troas, we took a straight course to Samothrace, and the next day to Neapolis,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.12'>and from there to Philippi, which is a principle city of the district of Macedonia colony. And we were in the same city remaining some days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.13'>And on the Sabbath day we went outside the city beside a river, where it was customary for prayer to be. And having sat down, we spoke to the women who came together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.14'>And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, a woman who worshiped God, was listening, whose heart the Lord opened to heed the things being spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.15'>And when she was immersed, and her household, she urged us, saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, after coming into my house, remain. And she constrained us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.16'>And it came to pass, as we were going to prayer, for a certain servant girl having a spirit of divination to meet us, who brought her masters much business by soothsaying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.17'>This woman having followed Paul and us was crying out, saying, These men are bondmen of the Most High God, who proclaim to us the way of salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.18'>And she did this on many days. But Paul, after being exasperated, and having turned, he said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.19'>But when her masters saw that the hope of their business was gone, having seized Paul and Silas, they dragged them into the marketplace to the rulers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.20'>And after bringing them to the magistrates, they said, These men, being Jews, disturb our city,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.21'>and proclaim customs that are not permitted for us to receive nor to do, being Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.22'>And the multitude rose up together against them. And the magistrates, having torn off their clothes, commanded to beat them with rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.23'>And having laid many blows upon them, they cast them into prison, having ordered the jailor to guard them securely,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.24'>who, having received such an order, threw them into the inner prison, and fastened their feet in the stocks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.25'>Now toward midnight Paul and Silas, while praying, were singing praises to God, and the prisoners were listening to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.26'>And suddenly a great earthquake occurred, so as for the foundations of the prison to shake. And immediately all the doors were opened, and the bonds of all the men were unfastened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.27'>And the jailor, who became awake and who saw the prison doors opened, having drawn out a sword was going to kill himself, supposing the prisoners to have fled.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.16.29'>And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and having become trembling, he fell down before Paul and Silas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.30'>And after bringing them outside, he said, Sirs, what must I do so that I may be saved?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.31'>And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and thou will be saved, thou and thy household.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.32'>And they spoke the word of the Lord to him, and to all those in his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.33'>And having taken them in that hour of the night, he washed from the stripes, and was immersed, he and all those of him, immediately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.34'>And having brought them into his house, he set out a table, and rejoiced, having believed in God with all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.35'>But when it became day, the magistrates sent out the police, saying, Release those men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.36'>And the jailor reported these words to Paul: The magistrates have sent out so that ye may be released. Now therefore after coming out, go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.37'>But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly, uncondemned men, being Romans, they cast us into prison, and now they thrust us out privately? Certainly not, but after coming, they shall lead us out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.38'>And the police reported these sayings to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Romans.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.39'>And having come they besought them, and when they brought them out, they asked them to go out of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.16.40'>And having departed from the prison, they came in to Lydia. And after seeing the brothers, they encouraged them, and departed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.17.1'>Now after passing through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica where there was a synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.2'>And according to Paul's custom, he went in to them, and for three Sabbaths he discoursed with them from the Scriptures,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.3'>explaining and pointing out that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and, This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.4'>And some of them were persuaded, and joined with Paul and Silas, and of the devout Greeks a great quantity, and of the prominent women not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.5'>But the disobedient Jews having taken along certain evil men of the marketplaces, and having gathered a mob, were rioting the city. And having stood by the house of Jason, they sought to bring them out to the populace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.6'>And not having found them, they dragged Jason and some brothers to the city rulers, shouting, The men who have agitated the world, these are present here also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.7'>whom Jason has received. And all these men are acting against the decrees of Caesar, asserting another man to be king, Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.8'>And they disturbed the multitude and the city rulers when they heard these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.9'>And after taking bond from Jason and the other men, they released them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.10'>And the brothers straightaway sent both Paul and Silas away through the night to Berea, who, when they arrived, went into the synagogue of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.11'>But these were more noble than those in Thessalonica, who received the word with all willingness, examining the Scriptures daily, if it has these things this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.12'>Indeed therefore many of them believed, also of the prominent Greek women, and of men, not a few.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.13'>But when the Jews of Thessalonica also learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea, they came there also, agitating the crowds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.14'>But then straightaway the brothers sent Paul away to go as far as to the sea, but both Silas and Timothy remained there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.15'>And those who brought Paul led him as far as Athens. And after taking a command for Silas and Timothy, that they should come to him quickly, they departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.16'>But while Paul waited for them in Athens, his spirit was aroused within him, seeing the city being completely idolatrous.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.17'>Indeed therefore he was discoursing in the synagogue with the Jews, and with those who worship, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.18'>And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers encountered him. And some said, Whatever does this babbler want to say? But others, He seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities, because he brought the good-news--Jesus and t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.19'>And having taken him, they brought him to the Areopagus, saying, Can we understand what this new doctrine is, being spoken by thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.20'>For thou bring some surprising things to our ears. Therefore, we want to know whatever these things aim to be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.21'>Now all the Athenians, and the foreigners who dwell alien there, were at leisure in nothing else, than to tell or to hear something new.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.22'>And having stood in the middle of the Areopagus, Paul said, Athenian men, I perceive you as deity-fearing in all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.23'>For, passing through and examining your religious objects, I also found an altar on which had been engraved, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye worship unknowingly, him I proclaim to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.24'>The God who made the world and all things in it, he, being Lord of heaven and earth, dwells not in temples made with hands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.25'>nor is he served by the hands of men, as needing anything, since he himself gives to all life, and breath, with all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.26'>And he made from one blood every nation of men to dwell upon all the face of the earth, having determined prescribed times, and the limits of their occupancy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.27'>to search for the Lord, if indeed perhaps they might grope for him and find him, although being not far from each one of us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.28'>For in him we live, and move, and exist, as also some of the performers from you have said, For of him we are also offspring.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.29'>Being therefore offspring of God, we ought not think the Divine to be like gold, or silver, or stone handiwork of the skill and thought of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.30'>Indeed therefore having overlooked the times of ignorance, God now commands for all men everywhere to repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.31'>Because he appointed a day during which he is going to judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he appointed, having provided assurance to all men because he raised him from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.32'>But when they heard the resurrection of the dead, of course they mocked, but others said, We will hear thee again about this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.33'>And so Paul departed from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.17.34'>But some men, having joined with him, believed, among whom was also Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.18'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.1'>And after these things Paul having separated from Athens, he came to Corinth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.2'>And having found a certain Jew named Aquila, a man of Pontus by origin, who recently came from Italy, and his wife Priscilla, because Claudius arranged for all the Jews to separate from Rome, he came to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.3'>And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and was working, for they were of the tentmakers craft.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.4'>And he was discoursing in the synagogue every Sabbath, and was persuading Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.5'>And when both Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul was being held by the Spirit, fully testifying to the Jews, Jesus the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.6'>But when they opposed and slandered him, having shaken out his clothes, he said to them, Your blood is upon your heads. I am clean. From henceforth I will go to the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.7'>And having departed from there, he went into the house of a certain man named Justus, who worships God, whose house was adjoining the synagogue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.8'>And Crispus, the synagogue ruler, believed in the Lord with his whole household, and many of the Corinthians who heard believed, and were immersed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.9'>And the Lord spoke to Paul by a vision at night, Fear not, but speak, and be not silent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.10'>because I am with thee, and no man will lay upon thee to harm thee, because many people are for me in this city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.11'>And he remained a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.12'>But Gallio being proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one accord attacked Paul and brought him to the judgment seat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.13'>saying, This man is persuading men to worship God against the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.14'>But when Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If therefore indeed it were some crime or evil reckless deed, O ye Jews, I would have tolerated you according to the matter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.15'>But if it is an issue about a word and names and the law from you, look ye yourselves, for I do not intend to be a judge of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.16'>And he drove them from the judgment seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.17'>But all the Greeks, having taken Sosthenes the synagogue ruler, were beating him in front of the judgment seat. And Gallio was not going to judge, even of these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.18'>But Paul, who still remained considerable days with the brothers, having separated, sailed away to Syria (and with him Priscilla and Aquila), having shaved his head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.19'>And he came to Ephesus and left behind those there, but having entered into the synagogue himself, he discoursed with the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.20'>And when they asked him to remain on more time with them, he did not consent,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.21'>but separated from them, having said, I must definitely keep the coming feast at Jerusalem, but I will return again to you, God willing. And he launched from Ephesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.22'>And after coming down to Caesarea, having gone up and greeted the church, he went down to Antioch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.23'>And after spending some time, he departed, passing through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, successively, strengthening all the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.24'>Now a certain Jew named Apollos, an Alexandrian by origin, an eloquent man, came to Ephesus, being mighty in the scriptures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.25'>This was a man who was instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in the Spirit, he was speaking and teaching accurately the things about the Lord, knowing only the immersion of John.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.26'>And this man began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Aquila and Priscilla heard him, they took him aside, and expounded to him the way of God more accurately.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.27'>And when he intended to pass through into Achaia, the brothers wrote, having encouraged the disciples to receive him, who, when he arrived, assisted much those who believed through the grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.18.28'>For he forcibly refuted the Jews in public, demonstrating by the scriptures Jesus to be the Christ.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.19'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.1'>And it came to pass while Apollos was at Corinth, for Paul, having passed through the upper regions, to come to Ephesus. And having found some disciples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.2'>he said to them, Did ye receive Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said to him, But we have not even heard if there is a Holy Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.3'>And he said to them, Into what then were ye immersed? And they said, Into John's immersion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.4'>And Paul said, John indeed immersed an immersion of repentance, saying to the people that they should believe in him who was coming after him, that is, in Jesus, the Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.5'>And when they heard this, they were immersed in the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.6'>And Paul having laid hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in tongues, and prophesied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.7'>And all the men were about twelve.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.8'>And after entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly for three months, discoursing and persuading the things about the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.9'>But when some were hardened and disobedient, speaking evil of the Way before the multitude, having withdrawn from them, he separated the disciples, discoursing daily in the school of a certain Tyrannus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.10'>And this happened for two years, so as for all those dwelling in Asia to hear the word of the Lord Jesus, both Jews and Greeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.11'>And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.12'>so as to even bring handkerchiefs or aprons from his skin to those who were incapacitated and to free their infirmities from them, and the evil spirits to go out from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.13'>But some of the wandering Jewish exorcists, attempted to name the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had the evil spirits, saying, We adjure you by Jesus whom Paul proclaims.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.14'>And there were some sons of Sceva, a Jewish chief priest, seven doing this.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.15'>And having answered, the evil spirit said, I know Jesus and I recognize Paul, but who are ye?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.16'>And the man in whom was the evil spirit, leaping on them, and having overpowered them, he prevailed against them, so as for them to flee out of that house naked and wounded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.17'>And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, to those who dwell at Ephesus. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.18'>And many of those who have believed came, confessing, and reporting their practices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.19'>And a considerable number of those who practiced magical things, having brought their books together, burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand pieces of silver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.20'>Thus the word of the Lord was growing mightily and was prevailing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.21'>Now when these things were fulfilled, Paul decided in the spirit, after passing through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, having said, After becoming there, I must also see Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.22'>And having sent into Macedonia two of those who help him, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.23'>And about that time there developed no small stir about the Way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.24'>For a certain silversmith named Demetrius who makes silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little work to the craftsmen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.25'>to whom also (having assembled the workmen about such things) he said, Men, ye know that our prosperity is from this work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.26'>And ye see and hear, that not only at Ephesus, but almost in all Asia, this man Paul, having persuaded them, turned away a considerable multitude, saying that there are no gods made by hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.27'>And not only is this our part liable to come into disrepute, but also the temple of the great goddess Artemis is going to be regarded for nothing, and also her magnificence be destroyed, whom all Asia and the world worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.28'>And when they heard this, having become full of wrath, they cried out, saying, The great Artemis of Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.29'>And the whole city was filled with the confusion. And they rushed with one accord into the theatre, having seized Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians, traveling companions of Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.30'>And when Paul wanted to enter in to the crowd, the disciples did not let him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.31'>And also some of the Asian officers, being their friends, having sent to him, implored him not to give himself into the theatre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.32'>Indeed therefore some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was confused, and most had not seen why they had come together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.33'>And they urged forward Alexander out of the multitude, having put him forward from the Jews. And Alexander having waved his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.34'>But after recognizing that he was a Jew, one voice developed from them all, crying out for about two hours, The great Artemis of Ephesians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.35'>And when the town clerk calmed the multitude, he says, Ephesian men, now who is the man who does not know the city of the Ephesians being temple-guardian of the great goddess Artemis, and of what fell from Zeus?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.36'>Therefore these things being undeniable, ye ought to be restrained, and do nothing rash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.37'>For ye brought these men, who are neither sacrilegious nor blaspheming your goddess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.38'>Indeed therefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen with him, have a matter against any man, forums are brought, and there are proconsuls. Let them accuse each other.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.39'>And if ye seek anything about other things, it will be decided in the assembly within law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.40'>For we are also in danger to be accused about the uproar today, there being no cause about which we can give account of this commotion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.19.41'>And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.20'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.1'>And after the uproar ceased, Paul having summoned the disciples and having embraced them, he departed to go into Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.2'>And having passed through those parts, and having exhorted them with many words, he came into Greece.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.3'>And having spent three months there, and a conspiracy having developed against him by Jews, intending to go up into Syria, a decision developed to return through Macedonia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.4'>And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater a Berean, and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus, and Gaius a Derbean, and Timothy, and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.5'>These men, who went ahead, awaited us at Troas.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.6'>And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came to them at Troas within five days, where we stayed seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.7'>And upon the first day of the week, the disciples having come together to break bread, Paul discoursed with them, intending to depart on the morrow. And he prolonged his speech until midnight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.8'>And there were considerable lights in the upper floor where we were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.9'>And a certain young man named Eutychus sitting in the window, being carried away by deep sleep (Paul discoursing on more), being carried away by sleep, he fell down below from the third floor, and was taken up dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.10'>But Paul having come down, he fell on him, and having embraced him he said, Be not troubled, for his life is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.11'>And after getting up, and having broken bread and eaten, and having conversed for a considerable time, until dawn, thus he departed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.12'>And they brought the boy alive, and were not a little comforted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.13'>But we, having gone ahead to the ship, went up to Assos, intending from there to take up Paul, for so it was arranged, he himself intending to go on foot.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.14'>And when he met with us at Assos, having taken him up, we came to Mitylene.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.15'>And having sailed from there on the next day, we arrived opposite Chios, and the next day we came near to Samos. And having remained in Trogyllium, on the following day we came to Miletus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.16'>For Paul determined to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not happen to lose time in Asia. For he was hastening, if it were possible, for him to become at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.17'>And from Miletus having sent to Ephesus, he summoned the elders of the congregation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.18'>And when they came to him, he said to them, Ye know, from the first day in which I stepped in Asia, how I became with you all the time,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.19'>serving the Lord with all humility, and many tears and trials that befell me by the conspiracies of the Jews.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.20'>How I kept back nothing of these things that are beneficial, not to inform you, and to teach you in public, and from house to house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.21'>testifying both to Jews and to Greeks repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.22'>And now behold, I, bound in the spirit, am going to Jerusalem, not knowing the things that will happen to me in it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.23'>except that the Holy Spirit testifies from city to city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.24'>But I make nothing of the matter, nor do I hold my life precious to myself, so as to fully complete my course with joy, and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to solemnly testify the good-news of the grace of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.25'>And now behold, I have seen that ye will no longer see my face, ye all among whom I passed through preaching the kingdom of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.26'>Therefore I solemnly declare to you this day, that I am clean from the blood of all men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.27'>For I did not withdraw from declaring to you the whole plan of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.28'>Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock, among which the Holy Spirit placed you guardians, to tend the church of the Lord and God, which he purchased by his own blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.29'>For I know this, that after my departure grievous wolves will enter in among you, not sparing the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.30'>And from you yourselves men will rise up, speaking distorted things, to draw away the disciples after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.31'>Therefore watch ye, remembering that for three years, night and day, I did not cease warning each one with tears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.32'>And now brothers, I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build up, and to give you an inheritance among all those who have been sanctified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.33'>I coveted no man's silver, or gold, or apparel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.34'>Ye yourselves know that these hands served my needs, and to those who were with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.35'>I gave you a glimpse of all things, that so laboring ye ought to aid the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.36'>And having spoken these things, having knelt down, he prayed with them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.37'>And there developed considerable weeping of all. And having fallen on Paul's neck, they kissed him much,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.20.38'>sorrowing especially for the word that he had spoken, that they were going to see his face no more. And they accompanied him to the ship.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.21'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.1'>And when it came to pass to launch us, after being drawn away from them, after going a straight course, we came to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.2'>And having found a ship crossing over to Phoenicia, having gotton on, we launched.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.3'>And having sighted Cyprus, and having left it behind on the left side, we sailed to Syria and came down to Tyre, for there the ship was unloading the merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.4'>And having found disciples (we remained there seven days) who said to Paul through the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.5'>And when it came to pass for us to finish the days, having gone forth, we were departing, all accompanying us, with women and children, as far as outside the city. And having knelt on the beach we prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.6'>And having bid farewell to each other, we went up in the ship, and those men returned to their own things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.7'>And when we finished the voyage from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais. And having greeted the brothers, we remained with them one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.8'>And on the morrow, after going forth, those around Paul came to Caesarea. And having entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, being of the seven, we dwelt with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.9'>Now four virgin daughters who prophesied were with this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.10'>And as we remained more days, a certain prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.11'>And having come to us, and having taken Paul's belt, having bound both his feet and hands, he said, The Holy Spirit says these things: Thus the Jews in Jerusalem will bind the man whose belt this is, and will deliver him into the h</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.12'>And when we heard these things, both we and those local men urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.13'>And Paul answered, What are ye doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I fare ready not only to be bound, but also to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.14'>And since he was not persuaded, we were quiet, having said, May the will of the Lord happen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.15'>And after these days, having made preparation, we went up to Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.16'>And also the disciples from Caesarea went together with us, bringing a certain Mnason, a Cypriot, an old disciple with whom we would lodge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.17'>And when we came to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.18'>And on the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.19'>And having greeted them, he reported one by one what God did among the Gentiles through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.20'>And when the men heard, they glorified God, having said to him, Thou see, brother, how many thousands there are of the Jews who have believed, and they are all zealots of the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.21'>And they were informed about thee, that thou teach all the Jews throughout the nations desertion from Moses, telling them not to circumcise the children nor to walk by the customs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.22'>What is it therefore? Certainly the multitude needs to get together, for they will hear that thou have come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.23'>Therefore do this that we say to thee. Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.24'>Having taken these, be purified with them. And pay expenses for them, so that they may shave the head. And all may know, that things of which they have been informed about thee, are nothing, but thou thyself also walk orderly, keep</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.25'>And about the Gentiles who have believed, we sent word, having decided for them to keep no such thing, except for them to guard against what is sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.26'>Then Paul, having taken the men on the following day, having been purified with them, entered into the temple, declaring the fulfillment of the days of purification, until the offering was offered for each one of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.27'>And when the seven days were about to be completed, the Jews from Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people and threw hands on him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.28'>crying out, Men, Israelites, help. This is the man who teaches all men everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place. And besides he also brought Greeks into the temple, and has defiled this holy place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.29'>For they were men who saw Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him, whom they supposed that Paul brought into the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.30'>And the whole city was moved, and there developed a running together of the people. And having taken Paul they dragged him out of the temple, and straightaway the doors were shut.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.31'>And while seeking to kill him, a report went up to the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem has been stirred up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.32'>And immediately after taking soldiers and centurions, he ran down to them. And they, when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, stopped beating Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.33'>And the chief captain having come near, he seized him, and commanded him to be bound with two chains. And he inquired whoever he may be, and what it is he has been doing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.34'>And some among the crowd shouted out one thing, some another. And not being able to know the certainty because of the uproar, he commanded him to be carried into the fort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.35'>And it came to pass when on the steps (it happened for him to be carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.36'>for the mass of the people followed, crying out, Away with him),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.37'>and as Paul was going to be brought into the fort, he says to the chief captain, Is it permitted for me to speak to thee? And he said, Thou know Greek?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.38'>Then thou are not the Egyptian who revolted before these days, and who led out into the wilderness the four thousand men of the Assassins?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.39'>But Paul said, I am really a Jewish man of Tarsus of Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. And I beg thee, allow me to speak to the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.21.40'>And having permitted him, Paul, having stood on the steps, motioned his hand to the people. And when a great hush developed, he called out in the Hebrew language, saying,</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.22'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.1'>Men, brothers, and fathers, hear now my defense to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.2'>And having heard that he called out to them in the Hebrew language, they offered more silence. And he says,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.3'>I am indeed a Jewish man, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but reared in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, reared accurately in the paternal law, being a zealot of God, as ye all are today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.4'>And I persecuted this Way as far as death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.5'>As also the high priest testifies about me, and all the senior council, from whom also having received letters to the brothers in Damascus, I was going to bring bound even those who were there to Jerusalem so that they might be pun</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.6'>And there happened to me, while going and approaching Damascus about noon, suddenly to flash forth from heaven a great light around me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.7'>And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why do thou persecute me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.8'>And I answered, Who are thou, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus the Nazarene, whom thou persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.9'>And those who were with me indeed saw the light and became afraid, but they heard not the voice of him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.10'>And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, After rising, go into Damascus, and there it will be told thee about all things that have been assigned for thee to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.11'>And as I was not seeing from the splendor of that light, I came into Damascus, being led by hand by those who accompanied me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.12'>And a certain Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report by all the Jews who dwell there,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.13'>having come near me, and having stood by, he said to me, Brother Saul, look up. And I looked up on him the same hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.14'>And he said, The God of our fathers appointed thee to know his will, and to see the Righteous man, and to hear a voice from his mouth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.15'>because thou will be a witness for him to all men of the things that thou have seen and heard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.16'>And now what is it going to be? Having arisen, immerse and wash away thy sins, calling on the name of the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.17'>And it came to pass, my having returned to Jerusalem and while I prayed in the temple, for me to became in a trance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.18'>And I saw him saying to me, Hurry and depart in haste out of Jerusalem, because they will not accept thy testimony about me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.19'>And I said, Lord, they know that I was imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those who believe in thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.20'>And when the blood of Stephen thy witness was shed, I myself also was standing by, and approving his killing, and keeping the garments of those who killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.21'>And he said to me, Depart, because I will send thee far away to Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.22'>And they heard him until this word. And they lifted up their voice, saying, Away with such a man from the earth, for he is not fit to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.23'>And of them crying out, and throwing off their garments, and casting dust into the air,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.24'>the chief captain commanded him be brought into the fort, having said to examine him by scourging, so that he might know for what reason they shouted against him this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.25'>And as they stretched him out with the thongs, Paul said to the centurion who stood by, Is it permitted for you to scourge a Roman man, and uncondemned?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.26'>And when the centurion heard, having come to the chief captain, he reported, saying, Look! What are thou about to do? For this man is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.27'>And the chief captain having come, he said to him, Tell me if thou are a Roman. And he said, Yes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.28'>And the chief captain answered, Of a great sum I obtained this citizenship. And Paul said, But then I was born so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.29'>Straightway therefore those who were about to examine him withdrew from him. And the chief captain was also afraid when he learned that he was a Roman, and because he was who bound him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.22.30'>But on the morrow, wanting to know the certainty of why he was accused by the Jews, he loosed him from the bonds, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to come. And having brought Paul down, he set him before them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.23'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.1'>And Paul, after looking intently at the council, said, Men, brothers, I have been a citizen in all good conscience to God until this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.2'>And the high priest Ananias ordered those who stood by him to strike his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.3'>Then Paul said to him, God is going to smite thee, a whitewashed wall. Thou even sit judging me according to the law, and violating law, thou command me to be struck?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.4'>And those who stood by said, Thou revile God's high priest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.5'>And Paul said, I had not known, brothers, that he is high priest, for it is written, Thou shall not speak ill of a ruler of thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.6'>But when Paul ascertained that the one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Men, brothers, I am a Pharisee, son of a Pharisee. About the hope and resurrection of the dead I am judged.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.7'>And when he said this, there developed a conflict of the Pharisees and Sadducees, and the group was divided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.8'>For in fact Sadducees say to be no resurrection nor heavenly agent nor spirit, but Pharisees acknowledge them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.9'>And there developed a great clamor. And some of the scholars of the Pharisees part having risen, they argued vehemently, saying, We find nothing wrong in this man. But if a spirit spoke to him, or a heavenly agent, we should not fi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.10'>And a great conflict having developed, the chief captain, having been alarmed lest Paul might be torn apart by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from the midst of them, and bring him into the fort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.11'>And the following night the Lord, having stood by him, said, Cheer up, Paul, for as thou have testified these things about me at Jerusalem, so thou must testify also at Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.12'>And when it became day, some of the Jews, having made a conspiracy, put themselves under a curse, saying neither to eat nor to drink until they would kill Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.13'>And there were more than forty who made this conspiracy,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.14'>who, having come near to the chief priests and the elders, said, We have put ourselves under a curse, a curse to taste of nothing until we would kill Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.15'>Now therefore ye with the council report to the chief captain that tomorrow he may bring him down to you, as though going to inquire more accurately the things about him. And we, before he comes near, are prepared to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.16'>But the son of Paul's sister, having heard of the ambush, having come and entered into the fort, he informed Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.17'>And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Take this young man to the chief captain, for he has something to inform him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.18'>Indeed therefore having taken him, he brought him to the chief captain, and says, Paul the prisoner, having called me, asked me to bring this young man to thee, who has something to say to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.19'>And the chief captain having grasped his hand, and having gone in private, he asked him, What is it that thou have to inform me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.20'>And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask thee that to tomorrow thou would bring Paul down to the council, as though going to inquire something more accurately about him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.21'>Therefore thou should not be persuaded by them, for more than forty men of them wait to ambush him, who have put themselves under an oath, neither to eat nor drink until they have killed him. And now are they ready, expecting the p</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.22'>Indeed therefore the chief captain dismissed the young man, having ordered, Tell no man that thou have shown these things to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.23'>And having summoned a certain two of the centurions, he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go to Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred spearmen at the third hour of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.24'>And provide beasts, so that after mounting Paul, they may bring him safely to Felix the governor,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.25'>after writing a letter containing this form:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.26'>Claudius Lysias to the eminent governor Felix, greeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.27'>This man who was seized by the Jews, and was going to be killed by them, having stood by with the soldiers, I rescued him, having learned that he is a Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.28'>And wanting to know for what reason they accused him, I brought him down to their council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.29'>whom I found accusing about issues of their law, having not one accusation worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.30'>And when it was reported to me of a plot going to be against the man by the Jews, I immediately sent him to thee, also having commanded the accusers to speak before thee the things against him. Be strong.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.31'>Indeed therefore, the soldiers, according to that which was precisely arranged for them, having taken Paul, they brought him through the night to Antipatris.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.32'>But on the morrow they returned to the fort, having allowed the horsemen to depart with him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.33'>who, after coming to Caesarea and having delivered the letter to the governor, also presented Paul to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.34'>And the governor having read it, and having questioned from what province he was, and having found out that he was from Cilicia,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.23.35'>he said, I will hear thee when thine accusers also will arrive. And he commanded him to be kept in the Praetorium of Herod.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.24'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.1'>And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and a certain orator, Tertullus, who appeared to the governor against Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.2'>And when he was called, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying, Experiencing much peace because of thee, and worthy deeds happening to this nation because of thy foresight,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.3'>we welcome, both always and everywhere, eminent Felix, with all thankfulness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.4'>But, that I may not detain thee on more, I entreat thee in thy clemency to hear us briefly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.5'>For we have found this man a plague, who even instigates sedition among all the Jews throughout the world, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.6'>who also attempted to profane the temple, whom also we took,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Acts.24.8'>from whom thou will be able, having examined him, to learn about all these things of which we accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.9'>And the Jews also agreed, claiming to have these things this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.10'>And when the governor gestured to him to speak, Paul answered, Knowing for many years thou being a judge to this nation, I gladly make a defense of these things about myself,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.11'>thou being able to learn that there are for me not more than twelve days from which I went up to worship in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.12'>And they found me neither in the temple disputing against any man, nor making a gang of a group, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.13'>Neither can they prove against me of which things they now accuse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.14'>But this I confess to thee, that according to the Way that they call a sect, so serve I the paternal God, believing all things written according to the law and the prophets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.15'>having hope toward God, which they themselves also await, to come to be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just and unjust.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.16'>And in this I fashion myself, having a conscience always nonstumbling before God and men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.17'>Now after more years I came, going to make donations to my nation, and offerings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.18'>during which certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, not with a crowd or with a tumult,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.19'>who ought to be here before thee, and to accuse, if they would have anything against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.20'>Or let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found in me, having stood before the council,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.21'>or about this one voice that I cried out standing among them: About a resurrection of the dead I am judged by you this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.22'>Now Felix, having heard these things, having known more precisely the things about the Way, he deferred them, having said, When Lysias the chief captain comes down, I will determine the things toward you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.23'>He also arranged for the centurion to guard Paul, and to have reduced confinement, and to forbid none of his own men to serve or to come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.24'>And after some days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla, his wife being Jewish, he summoned Paul, and heard him about the faith in Christ.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.25'>And as he discoursed about righteousness, and self-control, and the judgment going to be, Felix, having become afraid, answered, Go now, and having a convenient time, I will summon thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.26'>He also hoped simultaneously that money would be given him by Paul so that he might free him. And so, summoning him more frequently, he conversed with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.24.27'>But two years having been fulfilled, Felix received a successor, Porcius Festus. And wanting to lay down favors to the Jews, Felix left behind Paul bound.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Acts.25'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.1'>Festus therefore having entered into the province, after three days he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.2'>And the high priest and the principal men of the Jews appeared to him against Paul, and urged him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.3'>asking a favor against him, that he would summon him to Jerusalem, making an ambush to kill him on the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.4'>Indeed therefore Festus answered to keep Paul in Caesarea, and he himself was going to go out quickly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.5'>Therefore he says, Let the able men among you, after coming down together, accuse him if there is anything in this man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.6'>And after remaining among them more than ten days, having gone down to Caesarea, on the morrow having sat on the judgment seat, he commanded Paul to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.7'>And when he arrived, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood around, bringing many and serious accusations against Paul, which they could not prove,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.8'>while he was defending, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I transgressed anything.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.9'>But Festus, wanting to lay down a favor to the Jews, having answered Paul, said, Are thou willing, after going up to Jerusalem, to be judged there about these things before me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.10'>But Paul said, I am standing at the judgment seat of Caesar, where I ought to be judged. I did nothing wrong Jewish, as thou also very well know.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.11'>For if I am indeed wrong, and have done anything worthy of death, I do not refuse to die, but if there is nothing of what these men accuse me, no man can give me to them freely. I appeal Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.12'>Then Festus, when he conferred with the council, answered, Thou have appealed Caesar, to Caesar thou will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.13'>Now some days having passed, Agrippa the King and Bernice arrived at Caesarea, greeting Festus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.14'>And as he was remaining there more days, Festus declared to the King the things concerning Paul, saying, There is a certain man who was left behind a prisoner by Felix,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.15'>about whom, when I became in Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews revealed, asking judgment against him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.16'>To whom I answered, that it is not a custom by Romans to give any man freely for destruction, before the man being accused has the accusers in person, and receives an occasion of defense about the accusation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.17'>When therefore they assembled here, not having made one delay, next in order, having sat on the judgment seat, I commanded the man to be brought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.18'>About whom, when the accusers stood up, they brought not one cause of what I supposed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.19'>but had certain issues against him about his own religion, and about a certain Jesus, who has died, whom Paul was claiming to be alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.20'>And I, being uncertain of the controversy about this man, asked whether he wants to go to Jerusalem and be judged there about these things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.21'>But when Paul appealed to be kept for the decision of Augustus, I commanded him to be kept until I might send him to Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.22'>And Agrippa said to Festus, I also want to hear the man myself. And tomorrow, he says, thou will hear him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.23'>Therefore on the morrow, Agrippa and Bernice having come with great pomp, and having entered into the courtroom, and with the chief captains and the men of prominence who were of the city, and Festus who commanded, Paul was brought</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.24'>And Festus says, King Agrippa, and all who are present with us, ye see this man about whom all the multitude of the Jews appealed to me, both at Jerusalem and here, shouting he ought not to live any longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.25'>But I, having understood him to have done nothing worthy of death, and also him, this man, having appealed Augustus I decided to send him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.26'>About whom I do not have anything certain to write to the lord. Therefore I brought him before you, and especially before thee, king Agrippa, so that, an examination having occurred, I may have something to write.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.25.27'>For it seems to me unreasonable, sending a prisoner, and not to specify the causes against him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.26'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.1'>And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for thyself. Then Paul, having stretched forth his hand, made a defense.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.2'>Concerning all things of which I am accused by the Jews, king Agrippa, I consider myself blessed, being about to make my defense before thee today.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.3'>Especially thee, being an expert of all things regarding Jews, both habits and issues. Therefore I beg thee to hear me patiently.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.4'>Indeed therefore, my manner of life from youth, having developed from the beginning among my nation at Jerusalem, all the Jews know,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.5'>having known me previously from the beginning, if they were willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I lived a Pharisee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.6'>And now for the hope of the promise made by God to the fathers, I stand being judged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.7'>to which our twelve tribes, serving in earnestness night and day, hope to attain, about which hope, king Agrippa, I am accused by the Jews!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.8'>Why is it judged incredible with you, if God raises the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.9'>Indeed therefore I thought it necessary for myself to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.10'>which also I did at Jerusalem. And I locked up many of the sanctified in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests. And when they were killed, I gave a vote against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.11'>And punishing them often at all the synagogues, I compelled them to blaspheme. And being extraordinarily furious toward them, I persecuted them even as far as to outside cities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.12'>And during which, while going to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.13'>at midday, O king, I saw on the road a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, which shone around me and those who went with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.14'>And when we all fell to the ground, I heard a voice speaking to me, and saying in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why do thou persecute me? It is hard for thee to kick against the goads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.15'>And I said, Who are thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.16'>But arise, and stand upon thy feet, for I appeared to thee for this, to appoint thee an assistant and a witness both of things that thou saw, and of the things that I will make visible to thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.17'>delivering thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, to whom I send thee,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.18'>to open their eyes to turn about from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, for them to receive remission of sins and a lot among those who have been sanctified by faith in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.19'>Whereupon, king Agrippa, I did not become disobedient to the heavenly vision,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.20'>but declaring first to those at Damascus and then at Jerusalem, and in all the region of Judea, and to the Gentiles, to repent and return to God, doing works worthy of repentance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.21'>Because of these things the Jews, having seized me in the temple, tried to grasp and kill me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.22'>Having therefore experienced the help from God, I stand to this day solemnly declaring both to small and great, saying nothing apart from what both the prophets and Moses said was going to happen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.23'>that the suffering Christ, since first from a resurrection of the dead, is going to proclaim light to our people and to the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.24'>And while he made a defense by these things, Festus said in a loud voice, Paul, thou are mad. Much scholarship is driving thee into madness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.25'>But Paul says, I am not mad, eminent Festus, but I speak forth sayings of truth and soberness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.26'>For the king knows about these things, before whom I also speak boldly. For I am convinced not any of these things, nothing, to be hidden from him. For this was not done in a corner.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.27'>King Agrippa, do thou believe the prophets? I know that thou believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.28'>And Agrippa said to Paul, By a little thou persuade me to become a Christian.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.29'>And Paul said, I ever pray to God, both by little and by much, not only thee, but also all who hear me this day, to become such kind as I also am, apart from these bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.30'>And when he spoke these things, the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and those who sat with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.31'>And having withdrawn, they spoke to each other, saying, This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.26.32'>And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been released, if he had not appealed Caesar.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.27'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.1'>And when it was determined for us to sail for Italy, they delivered both Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion named Julius, of the band of Augustus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.2'>And having gotten on a ship of Adramyttium that was going to sail to the places along Asia, we launched, Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.3'>And on another day we put in at Sidon. And Julius, who treated Paul kindly, allowed him to undergo care, after going to his friends.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.4'>And having launched from there, we sailed under lee of Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.5'>And having sailed across the depths along Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, of Lycia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.6'>And there, the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy, he put us in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.7'>And sailing slowly during considerable days, and with difficulty having come along the Cnidus, the wind not allowing us further, we sailed under lee of Crete, along Salmone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.8'>And sailing by it with difficulty, we came to a certain place called Fair Havens, near to which was Lasea City.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.9'>And considerable time having past, and the voyage now being dangerous, also because the Fast was now past, Paul urged,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.10'>saying to them, Men, I perceive that the voyage is going to be with injury and much damage, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.11'>But the centurion was convinced more by the captain and the shipmaster than to those things spoken by Paul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.12'>And since the haven was inconvenient to winter in, the majority gave counsel to launch from there also, if somehow they might be able, after arriving at Phoenix, to winter in a haven of Crete, looking toward southwest and northwest</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.13'>And when a south wind blew gently, having presumed to have obtained their purpose, after taking up anchor, they sailed very near by Crete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.14'>But not long after, there threw against it a cyclonic wind called the Euroclydon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.15'>And the ship having been caught, and not being able to face the wind, having given up, we were driven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.16'>And having sailed under lee of a certain island called Clauda, we were able with difficulty, to develop control of the skiff.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.17'>And having taken that up, they used helps, undergirding the ship. And fearing lest they might fall off into the sandbank, having lowered the vessel, they were driven this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.18'>And since we were exceedingly storm-tossed, on the next day they jettisoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.19'>And the third day we cast out by hands the tackling of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.20'>And when neither sun nor stars appeared for more days, and no small storm laying on, all remaining hope for us to be saved was taken away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.21'>And being long without food, then Paul, who stood in the midst of them, said, Ye truly ought, O men, to have complied with me, not to launch from Crete, and gain this damage and loss.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.22'>And now I exhort you to cheer up, for there will not be one loss of life from you, except of the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.23'>For there stood by me this night an agent of the God whose I am, whom also I serve,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.24'>saying, Fear not, Paul. Thou must stand before Caesar, and lo, God has granted thee all those sailing with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.25'>Therefore men, cheer up, for I believe God, that it will be so in that way it has been told to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.26'>But we must fall off upon a certain island.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.27'>And when it became the fourteenth night, as we were driven about in the Adriatic sea, toward midnight the sailors suspected some region to come near them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.28'>And having tossed lead, they found twenty fathoms, and having gone a little farther, and having tossed lead again, they found fifteen fathoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.29'>And fearing lest somehow we might falloff on rough places, having cast off four anchors from the stern, they prayed for day to develop.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.30'>And since the sailors sought to flee out of the ship, and having lowered the skiff into the sea in pretense as going to stretch out anchors from the bow,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.31'>Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Unless these men remain in the ship, ye cannot be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.32'>Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the skiff, and let it fall off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.33'>And until day was going to develop, Paul urged them all to partake of food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day, waiting, ye continue without food, having taken nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.34'>Therefore I encourage you to take of food, for this is for your safety. For not a hair will fall from the head of one of you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.35'>And having said these things, and having taken bread, he expressed thanks to God in the presence of all. And having broke in pieces, he began to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.36'>And they all, having become encouraged, also took food.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.37'>And all the souls in the ship were two hundred seventy-six.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.38'>And after being filled of food, they unloaded the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.39'>And when it became day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a certain bay having a beach, onto which, they decided if possible, to drive the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.40'>And having cast off the anchors, they left them in the sea, at the same time unfastening the bands of the rudders. And having hoisted up the foresail to the wind, they held firm for the shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.41'>And having chanced upon a place where two seas meet, they ran the ship aground. And of course, the bow having become stuck, it remained immovable, but the stern was coming apart by the force of the waves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.42'>And a decision of the soldiers developed that they should kill the prisoners, lest any man, having swam away, might escape.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.43'>But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, prevented them from their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim, having first jumped out, to go to the land,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.27.44'>and the remaining, some on boards, and some on any of the things from the ship. And so it came to pass for all to be saved to the land.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Acts.28'>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.1'>And after being saved, then they learned that the island was called Malta.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.2'>And the foreigners presented uncommon kindness to us, for, having kindled a fire, they received us all because of the present rain, and because of the cold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.3'>And Paul having gathered a quantity of sticks, and having placed them on the fire, a viper having come out from the heat, it fastened on his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.4'>And when the foreigners saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to each other, Certainly this man is a murderer, whom, though saved from the sea, Justice did not allow to live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.5'>Indeed therefore having shaken off the creature into the fire, he experienced nothing harmful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.6'>But they expected he was going to swell up, or suddenly fall down dead, but when they were long expecting, and seeing nothing amiss happening to him, thinking differently, they declared him to be a god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.7'>Now among the things around that place were fields of the chief of the island, named Publius, who, having received us kindly, lodged us three days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.8'>And it came about for the father of Publius to be laid down, gripped by fever and dysentery, to whom Paul, having entered in, and having prayed, having laid his hands on him, healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.9'>Therefore when this happened, the others also who had infirmities on the island came and were healed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.10'>who also honored us with many honorariums. And while putting out to sea, they furnished the things for our necessities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.11'>And after three months we set out in a ship that wintered at the island, an Alexandrian with The Twin Brothers emblem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.12'>And after being brought down to Syracuse, we remained there three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.13'>from where having made a circuit, we arrived at Rhegium. And after one day, wind from the south having developed, we came a second day to Puteoli,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.14'>where, having found brothers, we were invited to stay with them seven days. And so we went toward Rome.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.15'>And from there the brothers, who heard these things about us, came for a meeting with us as far as Appius Forum and The Three Taverns, whom, when Paul saw, having expressed thanks to God, he took courage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.16'>And when we came to Rome, the centurion delivered the prisoners to the commandant, but Paul was allowed to dwell by himself with the soldier who guarded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.17'>And it came to pass after three days, for Paul to call together those who were the principle men of the Jews. And when they came together, he said to them, Men, brothers, I, having done nothing against the people, or the paternal c</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.18'>who, after examining me, wanted to release me, because there was not one cause of death in me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.19'>But when the Jews spoke against it, I was compelled to appeal Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.20'>Because of this reason therefore I summoned you to see and to speak with me, for because of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.21'>And they said to him, We neither received letters from Judea about thee, nor did any of the brothers who came report or speak anything bad about thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.22'>But we think it worthy to hear from thee what thou think. For indeed about this sect, it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.23'>And having appointed a day for him, more came to him into his lodging, to whom he expounded, solemnly testifying the kingdom of God, and persuading them of the things about Jesus, both from the law of Moses and the prophets, from m</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.24'>And some were convinced by the things that were spoken, and some disbelieved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.25'>And being discord among each other, they departed after Paul spoke one thing, saying, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet to our fathers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.26'>saying, Go thou to this people, and say, Hearing ye will hear, and will, no, not understand, and seeing ye will see, and will, no, not perceive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.27'>For this people's heart was made fat, and they hear heavily with the ears. And they shut their eyes, lest they may perceive with the eyes, and hear with the ears, and understand with the heart, and should turn, and I would heal the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.28'>Be it known to you therefore, that the salvation of God was sent to the Gentiles, and they will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.29'>And when he said these things, the Jews departed, having much disputing among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.30'>And Paul dwelt two whole years in his own hired lodging. And he received all who came in to him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Acts.28.31'>preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness, without hindrance.</verse>
