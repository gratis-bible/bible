        <verse osisID='Gen.1.1'>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.2'>And the earth was without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep, and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.3'>And God said, Let there be light, and there was light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.4'>And God saw the light, that it was good. And God divided the light from the darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.5'>And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.6'>And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.7'>And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.8'>And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.9'>And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together to one place, and let the dry land appear. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.10'>And God called the dry land Earth, and he called the gathering together of the waters Seas. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.11'>And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind (in which is the seed of them) upon the earth. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.12'>And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit in which is the seed of it, according to their kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.13'>And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.14'>And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night, and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.15'>And let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.16'>And God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, also the stars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.17'>And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.18'>and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.19'>And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.20'>And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.21'>And God created the great sea creatures, and every living creature that moves, which the waters brought forth abundantly, according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.22'>And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.23'>And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.24'>And God said, Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to their kind, cattle, and creeping things, and beasts of the earth according to their kind. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.25'>And God made the beasts of the earth according to their kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and everything that creeps upon the ground according to its kind. And God saw that it was good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.26'>And God said, Let us make man in our image--after our likeness--and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.27'>And God created man in his own image, in the image of God he created him, male and female he created them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.28'>And God blessed them. And God said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply and replenish the earth, and subdue it, and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over every living thing that moves upo</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.29'>And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed. To you it shall be for food,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.30'>and to every beast of the earth, and to every bird of the heavens, and to everything that creeps upon the earth in which there is life, for food--every green herb. And it was so.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.1.31'>And God saw everything that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.1'>And the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.2'>And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made, and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.3'>And God blessed the seventh day, and hallowed it, because in it he rested from all his work which God had created and made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.4'>These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day that LORD God made earth and heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.5'>And no plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprung up, for LORD God had not caused it to rain upon the earth. And there was not a man to till the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.6'>but there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.7'>And LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.8'>And LORD God planted a garden eastward, in Eden, and there he put the man whom he had formed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.9'>And out of the ground LORD God made to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food, also the tree of life in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.10'>And a river went out of Eden to water the garden, and from there it was divided, and became four heads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.11'>The name of the first is Pishon. That is it which encompasses the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.12'>And the gold of that land is good. There is bdellium and the onyx stone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.13'>And the name of the second river is Gihon. The same is it which encompasses the whole land of Cush.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.14'>And the name of the third river is Hiddekel [Tigris]. That is it which goes in front of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.15'>And LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.16'>And LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou may freely eat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.17'>but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shall not eat of it. For in the day that thou eat of it thou shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.18'>And LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be alone, I will make a help meet for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.19'>And out of the ground LORD God formed every beast of the field, and every bird of the heavens, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called every living creature, that was the name of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.20'>And the man gave names to all cattle, and to the birds of the heavens, and to every beast of the field, but for man there was not found a help meet for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.21'>And LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept. And [God] took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh in place of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.22'>And the rib, which LORD God had taken from the man, he made a woman, and brought her to the man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.23'>And the man said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. She shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.24'>Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall cling to his wife, and the two (LXX/NT) shall be one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.2.25'>And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.1'>Now the serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which LORD God had made. And he said to the woman, Yea, has God said, Ye shall not eat of any tree of the garden?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.2'>And the woman said to the serpent, Of the fruit of the trees of the garden we may eat,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.3'>but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, Ye shall not eat of it, nor shall ye touch it, lest ye die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.4'>And the serpent said to the woman, Ye shall not surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.5'>For God knows that in the day ye eat of it, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.6'>And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was a delight to the eyes, and that the tree was to be desired to make wise, she took of the fruit of it, and ate. And she also gave to her husband with her, and h</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.7'>And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.8'>And they heard the voice of LORD God walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of LORD God amongst the trees of the garden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.9'>And LORD God called to the man, and said to him, Where are thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.10'>And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I was naked. And I hid myself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.11'>And he said, Who told thee that thou was naked? Have thou eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee that thou should not eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.12'>And the man said, The woman whom thou gave to be with me, she gave me of the tree, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.13'>And LORD God said to the woman, What is this thou have done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I ate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.14'>And LORD God said to the serpent, Because thou have done this, cursed are thou above all cattle, and above every beast of the field. Upon thy belly thou shall go, and dust thou shall eat all the days of thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.15'>And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed. He shall bruise thy head, and thou shall bruise his heel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.16'>To the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy pain and thy childbearing, in pain thou shall bring forth children. And thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.17'>And to Adam he said, Because thou have hearkened to the voice of thy wife, and have eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shall not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake. In toil thou shall eat of it all</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.18'>Also, thorns and thistles it shall bring forth to thee, and thou shall eat the herb of the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.19'>In the sweat of thy face thou shall eat bread, till thou return to the ground, for out of it thou were taken. For thou are dust, and to dust thou shall return.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.20'>And the man called his wife's name Eve, because she was the mother of all living.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.21'>And LORD God made for Adam and for his wife coats of skins, and clothed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.22'>And LORD God said, Behold, the man has become as one of us--to know good and evil--and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.23'>therefore LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from where he was taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.3.24'>So he drove out the man. And he placed at the east of the garden of Eden the Cherubim, and the flame of a sword which turned every way, to guard the way of the tree of life.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gen.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.1'>And the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived, and bore Cain, and said, I have gotten a man from LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.2'>And again she bore his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.3'>And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought an offering to LORD of the fruit of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.4'>And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat of it. And LORD had respect to Abel and to his offering,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.5'>but he did not have respect to Cain and to his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.6'>And LORD said to Cain, Why are thou angry? And why has thy countenance fallen?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.7'>If thou do well, shall thou not be accepted? And if thou do not well, sin crouches at the door. Its desire shall be for thee, and thou shall rule over it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.8'>And Cain told Abel his brother. And it came to pass, when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.9'>And LORD said to Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not. Am I my brother's keeper?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.10'>And he said, What have thou done? The voice of thy brother's blood cries to me from the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.11'>And now cursed are thou from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.12'>When thou till the ground, it shall not henceforth yield to thee its strength. A fugitive and a wanderer thou shall be on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.13'>And Cain said to LORD, My punishment is greater than I can bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.14'>Behold, thou have driven me out this day from the face of the ground, and I shall be hid from thy face, and I shall be a fugitive and a wanderer in the earth. And it shall come to pass, that whoever finds me shall slay me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.15'>And LORD said to him, Therefore whoever kills Cain, vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And LORD appointed a sign for Cain, lest any who finds him should smite him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.16'>And Cain went out from the presence of LORD, and dwelt in the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.17'>And Cain knew his wife, and she conceived, and bore Enoch. And [Cain] built a city, and called the name of the city after the name of his son, Enoch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.18'>And to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad begot Mehujael, and Mehujael begot Methushael, and Methushael begot Lamech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.19'>And Lamech took to him two wives. The name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.20'>And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of such as dwell in tents and [have] cattle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.21'>And his brother's name was Jubal. He was the father of all such as handle the harp and pipe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.22'>And Zillah, she also bore Tubal-cain, the forger of every cutting instrument of brass and iron. And the sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.23'>And Lamech said to his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my voice, ye wives of Lamech, hearken to my speech. For I have killed a man for wounding me, and a young man for bruising me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.24'>If Cain shall be avenged seven fold, truly Lamech seventy-seven fold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.25'>And Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and called his name Seth. For, [she said], God has appointed for me another seed instead of Abel, for Cain killed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.4.26'>And to Seth, to him also there was born a son, and he called his name Enosh. Then men began to call upon the name of LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.6.1'>And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the ground, and daughters were born to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.2'>that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair. And they took to them wives of all that they chose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.3'>And LORD said, My spirit shall not strive with man forever, for he also is flesh. Yet shall his days be a hundred and twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.4'>The Nephilim were on the earth in those days. And also after that, when the sons of God came to the daughters of men, and they bore sons to them, the same were the mighty men who were of old, the men of renown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.5'>And LORD saw that the wickedness of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.6'>And LORD regretted that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him in his heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.7'>And LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the ground, from man, to beast, to creeping things, and birds of the heavens, for I regret that I have made them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.8'>But Noah found favor in the eyes of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.9'>These are the generations of Noah. Noah was a righteous man, perfect in his generations. Noah walked with God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.10'>And Noah begot three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.11'>And the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled with violence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.12'>And God saw the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt, for all flesh had corrupted their way upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.13'>And God said to Noah, The end of all flesh has come before me, for the earth is filled with violence through them, and, behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.14'>Make thee an ark of gopher wood. Thou shall make rooms in the ark, and shall pitch it inside and outside with pitch.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.15'>And this is how thou shall make it: The length of the ark three hundred cubits, the breadth of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.16'>Thou shall make a light for the ark, and thou shall finish it to a cubit upward. And thou shall set the door of the ark in the side of it, with lower, second, and third stories thou shall make it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.17'>And I, behold, I bring the flood of waters upon this earth, to destroy all flesh, in which is the breath of life, from under heaven. Everything that is on the earth shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.18'>But I will establish my covenant with thee. And thou shall come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons' wives with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.19'>And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort thou shall bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee. They shall be male and female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.20'>Of the birds according to their kind, and of the cattle according to their kind, of every creeping thing of the ground according to its kind. Two of every sort shall come to thee, to keep them alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.21'>And take thou to thee of all food that is eaten, and gather it to thee, and it shall be for food for thee, and for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.6.22'>Thus Noah did; according to all that God commanded him, so he did.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.7'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.1'>And LORD said to Noah, Come, thou and all thy house into the ark, for I have seen thee righteous before me in this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.2'>Of every clean beast thou shall take to thee by sevens, the male and his female. And of the beasts that are not clean two, the male and his female.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.3'>Also of the birds of the heavens by sevens, male and female, to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.4'>For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights, and every living thing that I have made I will destroy from off the face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.5'>And Noah did according to all that LORD commanded him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.6'>And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.7'>And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the flood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.8'>Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of birds, and of everything that creeps upon the ground,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.9'>there went in two by two to Noah into the ark, male and female, as God commanded Noah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.10'>And it came to pass after the seven days, that the waters of the flood were upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.11'>In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on the same day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.12'>And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.13'>In the selfsame day Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three wives of his sons with them, entered into the ark,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.14'>they, and every beast according to its kind, and all the cattle according to their kind, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, every bird of every sort.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.15'>And they went in to Noah into the ark, two by two of all flesh in which is the breath of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.16'>And those that went in, went in male and female of all flesh, as God commanded him. And LORD shut him in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.17'>And the flood was forty days upon the earth. And the waters increased, and bore up the ark, and it was lifted up above the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.18'>And the waters prevailed, and increased greatly upon the earth, and the ark went upon the face of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.19'>And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the high mountains that were under the whole heaven were covered,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.20'>fifteen cubits upward. The waters prevailed, and the mountains were covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.21'>And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, from birds, to cattle, to beasts, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, and every man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.22'>All in whose nostrils was the breath of the spirit of life, of all that was on the dry land, died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.23'>And every living thing was destroyed that was upon the face of the ground, from man, to cattle, to creeping things, and birds of the heavens, and they were destroyed from the earth. And only Noah was left, and those who were with h</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.7.24'>And the waters prevailed upon the earth a hundred and fifty days.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Gen.8'>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.1'>And God remembered Noah, and all the beasts, and all the cattle that were with him in the ark. And God made a wind to pass over the earth, and the waters subsided.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.2'>Also the fountains of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.3'>And the waters returned from off the earth continually. And after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters decreased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.4'>And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.5'>And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month. In the tenth month, on the first day of the month, the tops of the mountains were seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.6'>And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.7'>And he sent forth a raven. And it went forth to and fro, until the waters were dried up from off the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.8'>And he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were abated from off the face of the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.9'>But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot. And she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were on the face of the whole earth. And he put forth his hand, and took her, and brought her in to him into the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.10'>And he stayed yet another seven days, and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.11'>And the dove came in to him at evening. And, lo, in her mouth an olive leaf plucked off, so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.12'>And he stayed yet seven other days, and sent forth the dove. And she did not return again to him any more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.13'>And it came to pass in the six hundred and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth. And Noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked. And, behold, the face of the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.14'>And in the second month, on the twenty-seventh day of the month, the earth was dry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.15'>And God spoke to Noah, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.8.17'>Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee of all flesh, both birds and cattle, and every creeping thing that creeps upon the earth, that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.18'>And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons' wives with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.19'>Every beast, every creeping thing, and every bird, whatever moves upon the earth, according to their families, went forth out of the ark.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.20'>And Noah built an altar to LORD, and took of every clean beast, and of every clean bird, and offered burnt offerings on the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.8.21'>And LORD smelled the sweet savor. And LORD said in his heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake, for that the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth. Neither will I again any more smite everything</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.9.1'>And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said to them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.2'>And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth, and upon every bird of the heavens, with all with which the ground teems, and all the fishes of the sea. They are delivered into your hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.3'>Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you. As the green herb, I have given you all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.4'>But flesh with the life of it, [which is] the blood of it, ye shall not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.5'>And surely your blood, [the blood] of your lives, I will require. At the hand of every beast I will require it. And at the hand of man, even at the hand of every man's brother, I will require the life of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.6'>Whoever sheds man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed. For in the image of God he made man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.7'>And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply. Bring forth abundantly on the earth, and multiply on it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.8'>And God spoke to Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.9.11'>And I will establish my covenant with you. Neither shall all flesh be cut off any more by the waters of the flood, nor shall there be a flood any more to destroy the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.12'>And God said, This is the sign of the covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you, for perpetual generations:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.13'>I set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a sign of a covenant between me and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.9.14'>And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.47.9'>And Jacob said to Pharaoh, The days of the years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years. Few and evil have been the days of the years of my life, and they have not attained to the days of the years of the life of my father</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.10'>And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from the presence of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.11'>And Joseph placed his father and his brothers, and gave them a possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.12'>And Joseph nourished his father, and his brothers, and all his father's household, with bread, according to their families.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.13'>And there was no bread in all the land, for the famine was very severe, so that the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.14'>And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the grain which they bought. And Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.15'>And when the money was all spent in the land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph, and said, Give us bread, for why should we die in thy presence? For [our] money fails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.16'>And Joseph said, Give your cattle, and I will give you for your cattle, if money fails.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.17'>And they brought their cattle to Joseph. And Joseph gave them bread in exchange for the horses, and for the flocks, and for the herds, and for the donkeys. And he fed them with bread in exchange for all their cattle for that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.18'>And when that year was ended, they came to him the second year, and said to him, We will not hide from my lord, how that our money is all spent, and the herds of cattle are my lord's; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.19'>Why should we die before thine eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed, that we may live, and not die, and that the land not be desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.20'>So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh, for the Egyptians, every man, sold his field, because the famine was severe upon them. And the land became Pharaoh's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.21'>And as for the people, he moved them to the cities from one end of the border of Egypt even to the other end of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.22'>Only he did not buy the land of the priests, for the priests had a portion from Pharaoh, and ate their portion which Pharaoh gave them. Therefore they did not sell their land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.23'>Then Joseph said to the people, Behold, I have bought you this day and your land for Pharaoh. Lo, here is seed for you, and ye shall sow the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.24'>And it shall come to pass at the ingatherings, that ye shall give a fifth to Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own, for seed of the field, and for your food, and for those of your households, and for food for your little ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.25'>And they said, Thou have saved our lives. Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.47.27'>And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the land of Goshen. And they got possessions in it, and were fruitful, and multiplied exceedingly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.28'>And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years. So the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were a hundred forty-seven years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.29'>And the time drew near that Israel must die. And he called his son Joseph, and said to him, If now I have found favor in thy sight, put thy hand, I pray thee, under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me. Bury me not, I pray t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.30'>but when I sleep with my fathers, thou shall carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying place. And he said, I will do as thou have said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.47.31'>And he said, Swear to me, and he swore to him. And Israel bowed himself upon the head of the bed.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.48.3'>And Jacob said to Joseph, God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.4'>and said to me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a company of peoples, and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.5'>And now thy two sons, who were born to thee in the land of Egypt before I came to thee into Egypt, are mine, Ephraim and Manasseh, even as Reuben and Simeon, shall be mine.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Gen.48.10'>Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near to him, and he kissed them, and embraced them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.11'>And Israel said to Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face, and, lo, God has let me see thy seed also.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.12'>And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.13'>And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.14'>And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands deliberately, for Manasseh was the firstborn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.15'>And he blessed Joseph, and said, The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has fed me all my life long to this day,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.16'>the [heavenly] agent who has redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads, and let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac, and let them grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.17'>And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him. And he held up his father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.18'>And Joseph said to his father, Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn, put thy right hand upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.19'>And his father refused, and said, I know, my son, I know. He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great. However, his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gen.48.20'>And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee will Israel bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh. And he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</verse>
