      <chapter osisID='Ruth.1'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.1'>And it came to pass in the days when the judges judged, that there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of Bethlehem-judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and his wife, and his two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.2'>And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion, Ephrathites of Bethlehem-judah. And they came into the country of Moab, and continued there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.3'>And Elimelech, Naomi's husband, died, and she was left, and her two sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.4'>And they took wives for them of the women of Moab. The name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth, and they dwelt there about ten years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.5'>And Mahlon and Chilion died, both of them, and the woman was left of her two children and of her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.6'>Then she arose with her daughters-in-law that she might return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in the country of Moab how that LORD had visited his people in giving them bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.7'>And she went forth out of the place where she was, and her two daughters-in-law with her, and they went on the way to return to the land of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.8'>And Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, Go, return each of you to her mother's house. LORD deal kindly with you, as ye have dealt with the dead, and with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.9'>LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the house of her husband. Then she kissed them, and they lifted up their voices, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.10'>And they said to her, No, but we will return with thee to thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.11'>And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters. Why will ye go with me? Have I yet sons in my womb, that they may be your husbands?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.12'>Turn again, my daughters. Go your way, for I am too old to have a husband. If I should say, I have hope. If I should even have a husband tonight, and should also bear sons,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.13'>would ye therefore delay till they were grown? Would ye therefore stay from having husbands? No, my daughters, for it grieves me much for your sakes, for the hand of LORD has gone forth against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.14'>And they lifted up their voices, and wept again. And Orpah kissed her mother-in-law, but Ruth clung to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.15'>And she said, Behold, thy sister-in-law has gone back to her people, and to her god. Return thou after thy sister-in-law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.16'>And Ruth said, Entreat me not to leave thee, and to return from following after thee, for where thou go, I will go, and where thou lodge, I will lodge. Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.17'>Where thou die, I will die, and there I will be buried. LORD do so to me, and more also, if anything but death parts thee and me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.18'>And when she saw that she was steadfastly minded to go with her, she left off speaking to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.19'>So those two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to pass, when they came to Bethlehem, that all the city was moved about them, and [the women] said, Is this Naomi?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.20'>And she said to them, Call me not Naomi. Call me Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.21'>I went out full, and LORD has brought me home again empty. Why do ye call me Naomi, seeing LORD has testified against me, and the Almighty has afflicted me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.1.22'>So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law, with her, who returned out of the country of Moab. And they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.1'>And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of wealth, of the family of Elimelech, and his name was Boaz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.2'>And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, Let me now go to the field, and glean among the ears of grain after him in whose sight I shall find favor. And she said to her, Go, my daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.3'>And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers. And her chance was to land on the portion of the field belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.4'>And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said to the reapers, LORD be with you. And they answered him, LORD bless thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.5'>Then Boaz said to his servant who was set over the reapers, Whose damsel is this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.6'>And the servant who was set over the reapers answered and said, It is the Moabite damsel who came back with Naomi out of the country of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.7'>And she said, Let me glean, I pray you, and gather behind the reapers among the sheaves. So she came, and has continued even from the morning until now, except that she tarried a little in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.8'>Then Boaz said to Ruth, Do thou not hear, my daughter? Go not to glean in another field, neither pass from here, but abide here close by my maidens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.9'>Let thine eyes be on the field that they reap, and go thou after them. Have I not charged the young men that they shall not touch thee? And when thou are thirsty, go to the vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.10'>Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground, and said to him, Why have I found favor in thy sight that thou should take knowledge of me, seeing I am a foreigner?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.11'>And Boaz answered and said to her, It has been fully shown me all that thou have done to thy mother-in-law since the death of thy husband, and how thou have left thy father and thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and have com</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.12'>LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee of LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings thou have come to take refuge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.13'>Then she said, Let me find favor in thy sight, my lord, because thou have comforted me, and because thou have spoken kindly to thy handmaid, though I be not as one of thy handmaidens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.14'>And at mealtime Boaz said to her, Come here, and eat of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat beside the reapers, and they passed her parched grain, and she ate, and was satisfied, and left of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.15'>And when she arose up to glean, Boaz commanded his young men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not reproach her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.16'>And also pull out some for her from the bundles, and leave it, and let her glean, and do not rebuke her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.17'>So she gleaned in the field until evening. And she beat out that which she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.18'>And she took it up, and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. And she brought forth and gave to her that which she had left after she was satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.19'>And her mother-in-law said to her, Where have thou gleaned today? And where have thou worked? Blessed be he who took knowledge of thee. And she showed her mother-in-law with whom she had worked, and said, The man's name with whom I</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.20'>And Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, Blessed be he of LORD who has not left off his kindness to the living and to the dead. And Naomi said to her, The man is near of kin to us, one of our near kinsmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.21'>And Ruth the Moabitess said, Yes, he said to me, Thou shall keep close by my young men until they have ended all my harvest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.22'>And Naomi said to Ruth her daughter-in-law, It is good, my daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, and that they not meet thee in any other field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.2.23'>So she kept close by the maidens of Boaz, to glean to the end of barley harvest and of wheat harvest. And she dwelt with her mother-in-law.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.1'>And Naomi her mother-in-law said to her, My daughter, shall I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.2'>And now is not Boaz our kinsman, with whose maidens thou were? Behold, he winnows barley tonight in the threshing-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.3'>Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment upon thee, and get thee down to the threshing-floor. But do not make thyself known to the man until he shall have done eating and drinking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.4'>And it shall be, when he lays down, that thou shall notice the place where he shall lays. And thou shall go in, and uncover his feet, and lay thee down. And he will tell thee what thou shall do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.5'>And she said to her, All that thou say I will do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.6'>And she went down to the threshing-floor, and did according to all that her mother-in-law bade her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.7'>And when Boaz had eaten and drank, and his heart was merry, he went to lay down at the end of the heap of grain. And she came softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.8'>And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was startled, and turned himself, and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.9'>And he said, Who are thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thy handmaid. Spread therefore thy skirt over thy handmaid, for thou are a near kinsman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.10'>And he said, Blessed be thou of LORD, my daughter. Thou have shown more kindness in the latter end than at the beginning, inasmuch as thou did not follow young men, whether poor or rich.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.11'>And now, my daughter, fear not. I will do to thee all that thou say, for all the city of my people knows that thou are a worthy woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.12'>And now it is TRUE that I am a near kinsman. However there is a kinsman nearer than I.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.13'>Remain this night, and it shall be in the morning that if he will perform to thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do the kinsman's part. But if he will not do the part of a kinsman to thee, then I will do the part of a kinsman</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.14'>And she lay at his feet until the morning. And she rose up before one could discern another. For he said, Let it not be known that the woman came to the threshing-floor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.15'>And he said, Bring the mantle that is upon thee, and hold it. And she held it, and he measured six [measures] of barley, and laid it on her, and he went into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.16'>And when she came to her mother-in-law, she said, Who are thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.17'>And she said, He gave me these six [measures] of barley, for he said, Go not empty to thy mother-in-law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.3.18'>Then she said, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the matter will fall, for the man will not rest until he has finished the thing this day.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ruth.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.1'>Now Boaz went up to the gate, and sat down there. And, behold, the near kinsman of whom Boaz spoke came by, to whom he said, Such man, stay, turn aside. Sit down here. And he turned aside, and sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.2'>And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit ye down here. And they sat down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.3'>And he said to the near kinsman, Naomi, who has come again out of the country of Moab, sells the parcel of land, which was our brother Elimelech's.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.4'>And I thought to disclose it to thee, saying, Buy it before those who sit here, and before the elders of my people. If thou will redeem it, redeem it, but if thou will not redeem it, then tell me that I may know, for there is none</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.5'>Then Boaz said, That day thou buy the field of the hand of Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.6'>And the near kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself lest I mar my own inheritance. Take thou my right of redemption on thee, for I cannot redeem it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.7'>Now this was [the custom] in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning exchanging, to confirm all things: A man drew off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbor. And this was the [manner of] attestation in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.8'>So the near kinsman said to Boaz, Buy it for thyself. And he drew off his shoe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.9'>And Boaz said to the elders, and to all the people, Ye are witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, from the hand of Naomi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.10'>Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, I have purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon his inheritance, that the name of the dead not be cut off from among his brothers, and from the gate of his plac</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.11'>And all the people who were in the gate, and the elders, said, We are witnesses. LORD make the woman that has come into thy house like Rachel and like Leah, which two built the house of Israel, and do thou worthily in Ephrathah, an</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.12'>And let thy house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, of the seed which LORD shall give thee by this young woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.13'>So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and LORD gave her conception, and she bore a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.14'>And the women said to Naomi, Blessed be LORD, who has not left thee this day without a near kinsman. And let his name be famous in Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.15'>And he shall be to thee a restorer of life, and a nourisher of thine old age, for thy daughter-in-law, who loves thee, who is better to thee than seven sons, has borne him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.16'>And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became nurse to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.17'>And the women, her neighbors, gave it a name, saying, There is a son born to Naomi. And they called his name Obed. He is the father of Jesse, the father of David.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.18'>Now these are the generations of Perez: Perez begot Hezron,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.19'>and Hezron begot Ram, and Ram begot Amminadab,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.20'>and Amminadab begot Nahshon, and Nahshon begot Salmon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.21'>and Salmon begot Boaz, and Boaz begot Obed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ruth.4.22'>and Obed begot Jesse, and Jesse begot David.</verse>
