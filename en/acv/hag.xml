        <verse osisID='Hag.1.1'>In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in the first day of the month, the word of LORD came by Haggai the prophet to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the hi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.2'>Thus speaks LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, It is not the time [for us] to come, the time for LORD's house to be built.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.3'>Then the word of LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.4'>Is it a time for you yourselves to dwell in your paneled houses while this house lays waste?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.5'>Now therefore thus says LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.6'>Ye have sown much, and bring in little. Ye eat, but ye have not enough. Ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink. Ye clothe yourselves, but there is none warm. And he who earns wages earns wages [to put] into a bag with holes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.7'>Thus says LORD of hosts: Consider your ways.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.8'>Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house. And I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.9'>Ye looked for much, and, lo, it came to little, and when ye brought it home, I blew upon it. Why? says LORD of hosts. Because of my house that lays waste while ye run each man to his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.10'>Therefore for your sake the heavens withhold the dew, and the earth withholds its fruit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.11'>And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the grain, and upon the new wine, and upon the oil, and upon that which the ground brings forth, and upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labor of th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.12'>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people, obeyed the voice of LORD their God, and the words of Haggai the prophet, as LORD their God had sent him. An</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.13'>Then Haggai, LORD's messenger, spoke in LORD's message to the people, saying, I am with you, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.14'>And LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the spirit of all the remnant of the people. And they came and did work on th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.1.15'>in the twenty-fourth day of the month, in the sixth [month], in the second year of Darius the king.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Hag.2'>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.1'>In the seventh [month], in the twenty-first [day] of the month, the word of LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.2'>Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.3'>Who is left among you that saw this house in its former glory? And how do ye see it now? Is it not in your eyes as nothing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.4'>Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, says LORD, and be strong, O Joshua, son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and be strong, all ye people of the land, says LORD, and work. For I am with you, says LORD of hosts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.5'>[according to] the word that I covenanted with you when ye came out of Egypt, and my Spirit abode among you. Fear ye not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.6'>For thus says LORD of hosts: Yet once, it is a little while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.7'>And I will shake all nations, and the precious things of all nations shall come, and I will fill this house with glory, says LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.8'>The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.9'>The latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former, says LORD of hosts, and in this place I will give peace, says LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.10'>In the twenty-fourth [day] of the ninth [month], in the second year of Darius, the word of LORD came by Haggai the prophet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.11'>Thus says LORD of hosts: Ask now the priests concerning the law, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.12'>If a man bears holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with his skirt touches bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any food, shall it become holy? And the priests answered and said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.13'>Then Haggai said, If a man who is unclean because of a dead body touches any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered and said, It shall be unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.14'>Then Haggai answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, says LORD, and so is every work of their hands. And that which they offer there is unclean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.15'>And now, I pray you, consider from this day and backward, before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.16'>Through all that time, when a man came to a heap of twenty [measures], there were but ten. When he came to the wine vat to draw out fifty [vessels], there were but twenty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.17'>I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all the work of your hands, yet ye [turned] not to me, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.18'>Consider, I pray you, from this day and backward, from the twenty-fourth day of the ninth [month], since the day that the foundation of LORD's temple was laid, consider it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.19'>Is the seed yet in the barn? Yea, the vine, and the fig tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree have not brought forth. From this day I will bless [you].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.20'>And the word of LORD came the second time to Haggai in the twenty-fourth [day] of the month, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.21'>Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake the heavens and the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.22'>And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the nations. And I will overthrow the chariots, and those who ride in them. And the horses and their riders shall come down, each one b</verse>
        <verse osisID='Hag.2.23'>In that day, says LORD of hosts, I will take thee, O Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, says LORD, and will make thee as a signet. For I have chosen thee, says LORD of hosts.</verse>
