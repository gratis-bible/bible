      <chapter osisID='Isa.1'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.1'>The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem, in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.2'>Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth, for LORD has spoken. I have nourished and brought up sons, and they have rebelled against me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.3'>The ox knows his owner, and the donkey his master's crib, [but] Israel does not know; my people does not consider.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.4'>Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of evil-doers, sons who deal corruptly! They have forsaken LORD. They have despised the Holy One of Israel. They have gone away backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.5'>Why will ye be still stricken, that ye revolt more and more? The whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.6'>From the sole of the foot even to the head there is no soundness in it, [but] wounds, and bruises, and fresh stripes. They have not been closed nor bound up nor soothed with oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.7'>Your country is desolate. Your cities are burned with fire. Your land--strangers devour it in your presence, and it is desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.8'>And the daughter of Zion is left as a booth in a vineyard, as a shed in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.9'>Unless LORD of hosts had left to us a seed (LXX/NT), we should have been as Sodom, we should have been like Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.10'>Hear the word of LORD, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.11'>What to me is the multitude of your sacrifices? says LORD. I have had enough of the burnt-offerings of rams, and the fat of fed beasts. And I do not delight in the blood of bullocks or of lambs or of he-goats.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.12'>When ye come to appear before me, who has required this at your hand--to trample my courts?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.13'>Bring no more vain oblations. Incense is an abomination to me. New moon and Sabbath, the calling of assemblies--I cannot bear iniquity and the solemn meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.14'>Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates. They are a trouble to me. I am weary of bearing them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.15'>And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide my eyes from you. Yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear; your hands are full of blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.16'>Wash you, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before my eyes. Cease to do evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.17'>Learn to do good. Seek justice, relieve the oppressed, judge the fatherless, plead for the widow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.18'>Come now, and let us reason together, says LORD, though your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow. Though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.19'>If ye are willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.20'>But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the sword, for the mouth of LORD has spoken it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.21'>How the faithful city has become a harlot! She who was full of justice! Righteousness lodged in her, but now murderers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.22'>Thy silver has become dross, thy wine mixed with water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.23'>Thy rulers are rebellious, and companions of thieves. Everyone loves bribes, and follows after rewards. They judge not the fatherless, nor does the cause of the widow come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.24'>Therefore says the Lord, LORD of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel, Ah, I will ease me of my adversaries, and avenge me of my enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.25'>And I will turn my hand upon thee, and thoroughly purge away thy dross, and will take away all thy tin.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.26'>And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy counselors as at the beginning. Afterward thou shall be called the city of righteousness, a faithful town.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.27'>Zion shall be redeemed with justice, and her converts with righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.28'>But the destruction of transgressors and sinners shall be together, and those who forsake LORD shall be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.29'>For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired, and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have chosen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.30'>For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fades, and as a garden that has no water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.1.31'>And the strong shall be as flax, and his work as a spark. And they shall both burn together, and none shall quench them.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.2'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.1'>The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.2'>And it shall come to pass in the latter days, that the mountain of LORD's house shall be established on the top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow to it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.3'>And many peoples shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to the mountain of LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths. For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.4'>And he will judge between the nations, and will decide concerning many peoples, and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning-hooks. Nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.5'>O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.6'>For thou have forsaken thy people the house of Jacob, because they are filled [with things] from the east, and [are] soothsayers like the Philistines. And they strike hands with the children of foreigners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.7'>And their land is full of silver and gold, neither is there any end of their treasures. Their land is also full of horses, neither is there any end of their chariots.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.8'>Their land is also full of idols. They worship the work of their own hands, that which their own fingers have made,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.9'>and [so] the common man bows down, and the great man degrades himself. Therefore do not forgive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.10'>Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before the terror of LORD, and from the glory of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.11'>The lofty looks of man shall be brought low, and the haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.12'>For there shall be a day of LORD of hosts upon all that is proud and haughty, and upon all that is lifted up, and it shall be brought low,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.13'>and upon all the cedars of Lebanon that are high and lifted up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.14'>and upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that are lifted up,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.15'>and upon every lofty tower, and upon every fortified wall,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.16'>and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant imagery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.17'>And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low, and LORD alone shall be exalted in that day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.18'>And the idols shall utterly pass away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.19'>And men shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the holes of the earth, from before the terror of LORD, and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.20'>In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver, and their idols of gold, which have been made for them to worship, to the moles and to the bats,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.21'>to go into the caverns of the rocks, and into the clefts of the ragged rocks, from before the terror of LORD, and from the glory of his majesty, when he arises to shake the earth mightily.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.2.22'>Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for how is he to be accounted of?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.3'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.1'>For, behold, the Lord, LORD of hosts, takes away from Jerusalem and from Judah support and staff, the whole support of bread, and the whole support of water,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.2'>the mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the diviner, and the elder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.3'>the captain of fifty, and the honorable man, and the counselor, and the expert craftsman, and the skilful enchanter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.4'>And I will give sons to be their rulers, and babes shall rule over them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.5'>And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and every one by his neighbor. The child shall behave himself proudly against the old man, and the base against the honorable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.6'>When a man shall take hold of his brother in the house of his father, [saying], Thou have clothing, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.7'>in that day he shall lift up [his voice], saying, I will not be a healer, for in my house is neither bread nor clothing. Ye shall not make me ruler of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.8'>For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen, because their tongue and their doings are against LORD, to provoke the eyes of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.9'>The show of their countenance witnesses against them, and they declare their sin as Sodom; they do not hide it. Woe to their soul! For they have done evil to themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.10'>Say ye of the righteous, that [it is] well, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.11'>Woe to the wicked! [It is] ill [with him], for what his hands have done shall be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.12'>As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, those who lead thee cause thee to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.13'>LORD stands up to contend, and stands to judge the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.14'>LORD will enter into judgment with the elders of his people, and the rulers of it. It is ye who have eaten up the vineyard; the spoil of a poor man is in your houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.15'>What do ye mean that ye crush my people, and grind the face of the poor? says the Lord, LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.16'>Moreover LORD said, Because the daughters of Zion are haughty, and walk with outstretched necks and wanton eyes, walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with their feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.17'>therefore LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the head of the daughters of Zion, and LORD will lay bare their secret parts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.18'>In that day LORD will take away the beauty of their anklets, and the hair nets, and the crescents,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.19'>the pendants, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.20'>the bonnets, and the ankle chains, and the sashes, and the perfume-boxes, and the amulets,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.21'>the rings, and the nose-jewels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.22'>the festival robes, and the mantles, and the shawls, and the satchels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.23'>the hand-mirrors, and the fine linen, and the turbans, and the veils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.24'>And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet spices there shall be rottenness, and instead of a girdle, a rope, and instead of well set hair, baldness, and instead of a robe, a girding of sackcloth, branding instead of beauty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.25'>Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.3.26'>And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall be desolate and sit upon the ground.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.4'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.1'>And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel. Only let us be called by thy name; take thou away our reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.2'>In that day the branch of LORD shall be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land shall be excellent and comely for those who have escaped from Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.3'>And it shall come to pass, that he who is left in Zion, and he who remains in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even everyone who is written among the living in Jerusalem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.4'>when LORD shall have washed away the filth of the daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of Jerusalem from the midst of it, by the spirit of justice, and by the spirit of burning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.5'>And LORD will create over the whole habitation of mount Zion, and over her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and the shining of a flaming fire by night, for over all the glory, a covering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.4.6'>And there shall be a pavilion for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a refuge, and for a covert from storm and from rain.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Isa.5'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.1'>Let me sing for my well-beloved a song of my beloved concerning his vineyard. My well-beloved had a vineyard in a very fruitful hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.2'>And he dug it, and gathered out the stones of it, and planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress in it. And he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought fo</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.3'>And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I pray you, between me and my vineyard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.4'>What could have been done more to my vineyard that I have not done in it? Why, when I looked that it should bring forth grapes, it brought forth wild grapes?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.5'>And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the hedge of it, and it shall be eaten up. I will break down the wall of it, and it shall be trodden down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.6'>And I will lay it waste. It shall not be pruned nor hoed, but there shall come up briers and thorns. I will also command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.7'>For the vineyard of LORD of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Judah his pleasant plant. And he looked for justice, but, behold, oppression, for righteousness, but, behold, a cry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.8'>Woe to those who join house to house, who lay field to field, till there is no room, and ye be made to dwell alone in the midst of the land!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.9'>In my ears [says] LORD of hosts, of a truth many houses shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.10'>For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a homer of seed shall yield [but] an ephah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.11'>Woe to those who rise up early in the morning, that they may follow strong drink, who tarry late into the night, till wine inflame them!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.12'>And the harp and the lute, the tambourine and the pipe, and wine, are [in] their feasts, but they do not regard the work of LORD, nor have they considered the operation of his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.13'>Therefore my people have gone into captivity for lack of knowledge, and their honorable men are famished, and their multitude are parched with thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.14'>Therefore Sheol has enlarged its desire, and opened its mouth without measure. And their glory, and their multitude, and their pomp, and he who rejoices among them, descend [into it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.15'>And the common man is bowed down, and the great man is debased, and the eyes of the lofty are humbled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.16'>but LORD of hosts is exalted in justice, and God the Holy One is sanctified in righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.17'>Then the lambs shall feed as in their pasture, and wanderers shall eat the waste places of the fat ones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.18'>Woe to those who draw iniquity with cords of falsehood, and sin as it were with a cart rope,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.19'>who say, Let him make speed, let him hasten his work, that we may see it. And let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near and come, that we may know it!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.5.23'>who justify the wicked for rewards, and take away the justice of the righteous man from him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.24'>Therefore as the tongue of fire devours the stubble, and as the dry grass sinks down in the flame, so their root shall be as rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust, because they have rejected the law of LORD of hosts, an</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.25'>Therefore the anger of LORD is kindled against his people, and he has stretched forth his hand against them, and has smitten them. And the mountains tremble, and their dead bodies are as refuse in the midst of the streets. For all</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.26'>And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and will whistle for them from the end of the earth, and, behold, they shall come with speed swiftly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.27'>None shall be weary nor stumble among them. None shall slumber nor sleep, nor shall the belt of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.28'>whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent. Their horses' hoofs shall be accounted as flint, and their wheels as a whirlwind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.29'>Their roaring shall be like a lioness. They shall roar like young lions. Yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and carry it away safe, and there shall be none to deliver.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.5.30'>And they shall roar against them in that day like the roaring of the sea. And if [a man] looks to the land, behold, darkness [and] distress, and the light is darkened in the clouds of it.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.6'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.1'>In the year that king Uzziah died I saw LORD sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the temple.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.2'>Above him stood the seraphim. Each one had six wings, with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he flew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.3'>And one cried to another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is LORD of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.4'>And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of him who cried, and the house was filled with vapor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.5'>Then I said, Woe is me! For I am undone, because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips. For my eyes have seen the King, LORD of hosts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.6'>Then one of the seraphim flew to me, having a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.7'>And he touched my mouth with it, and said, Lo, this has touched thy lips, and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin forgiven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.8'>And I heard the voice of LORD, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us? Then I said, I am here, send me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.6.10'>Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and turn, and be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.11'>Then I said, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until cities be waste without inhabitant, and houses without man, and the land become utterly waste,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.6.12'>and LORD has removed men far away, and the forsaken places be many in the midst of the land.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.7.2'>And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is allied with Ephraim. And his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest tremble with the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.3'>Then LORD said to Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz, thou, and Shear-jashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of the upper pool, in the highway of the fuller's field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.4'>And say to him, Take heed, and be quiet. Fear not, nor let thy heart be faint, because of these two tails of smoking firebrands, for the fierce anger of Rezin and Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.5'>Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have purposed evil against thee, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.6'>Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a breach in it for us, and set up a king in the midst of it, even the son of Tabeel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.7'>thus says lord LORD: It shall not stand, nor shall it come to pass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.8'>For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Rezin. And within sixty-five years Ephraim shall be broken in pieces, so that is shall not be a people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.9'>And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be established.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.10'>And LORD spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.11'>Ask thee a sign of LORD thy God, ask it either in the depth, or in the height above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.12'>But Ahaz said, I will not ask, nor will I challenge LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.13'>And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David. Is it a small thing for you to weary men, that ye will weary my God also?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.14'>Therefore LORD himself will give you a sign: Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.15'>Butter and honey shall he eat, when he knows to refuse the evil, and choose the good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.16'>For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the good, the land whose two kings thou abhor shall be forsaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.17'>LORD will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that Ephraim departed from Judah--[even] the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.18'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that LORD will whistle for the fly that is in the outermost part of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.19'>And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the desolate valleys, and in the clefts of the rocks, and upon all thorn-hedges, and upon all pastures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.20'>In that day LORD will shave with a razor what is hired in the parts beyond the River, [even] with the king of Assyria, the head and the hair of the feet, and it shall also consume the beard.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.21'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall keep alive a young cow and two sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.22'>And it shall come to pass, that because of the abundance of milk which they shall give he shall eat butter. For everyone who is left in the midst of the land shall eat butter and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.23'>And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver coins, shall be for briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.24'>[Men] shall come there with arrows and with bow, because all the land shall be briers and thorns.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.7.25'>And all the hills that were dug with the mattock, thou shall not come there for fear of briers and thorns, but it shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading of sheep.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.8'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.1'>And LORD said to me, Take thee a great tablet, and write upon it with the pen of a man, For Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.8.3'>And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. Then LORD said to me, Call his name Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.4'>For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father, and, My mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall be carried away before the king of Assyria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.5'>And LORD spoke to me yet again, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.6'>Inasmuch as this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.7'>now therefore, behold, LORD brings up upon them the waters of the River, strong and many, [even] the king of Assyria and all his glory. And it shall come up over all its channels, and go over all its banks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.8'>and it shall sweep onward into Judah. It shall overflow and pass through; it shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of its wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.9'>Make an uproar, O ye peoples, and be broken in pieces. And give ear, all ye of far countries. Gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces. Gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.10'>Take counsel together, and it shall be brought to nothing. Speak the word, and it shall not stand, for God is with us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.11'>For LORD spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.12'>Say ye not, A conspiracy, concerning all of which this people shall say, A conspiracy, nor fear ye their fear, nor be in dread [of it].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.13'>LORD of hosts, him ye shall sanctify, and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.14'>And he shall be for a sanctuary, but for a stone of stumbling and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a net and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.15'>And many shall stumble on it, and fall, and be broken, and be snared, and be taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.16'>Bind thou up the testimony. Seal the law among my disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.17'>And I will wait for LORD, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I will be a man who has trusted (LXX/NT) in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.18'>Behold, I and the children whom LORD has given me are for signs and for wonders in Israel from LORD of hosts, who dwells in mount Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.19'>And when they shall say to you, Seek for those who have familiar spirits and for the wizards, who chirp and who mutter, should not a people seek for their God? On behalf of the living [seek] to the dead?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.20'>[Seek] to the law and to the testimony! If they speak not according to this word, surely there is no morning for them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.21'>And they shall pass through it, greatly distressed and hungry. And it shall come to pass that, when they shall be hungry, they shall fret themselves, and curse by their king and by their God, and turn their faces upward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.8.22'>And they shall look to the earth, and, behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and into thick darkness [to be] driven away.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.9.7'>Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to establish it, and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from henceforth even forever. The zeal of L</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.8'>LORD sent a word into Jacob, and it has lighted upon Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.9.9'>And all the people shall know, [even] Ephraim and the inhabitant of Samaria, who say in pride and in arrogance of heart,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.29.1'>Ho Ariel, Ariel, the city where David encamped! Add ye year to year. Let the feasts come round.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.2'>Then I will distress Ariel, and there shall be mourning and lamentation, and she shall be to me as Ariel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.3'>And I will encamp against thee round about, and will lay siege against thee with posted troops. And I will raise siege works against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.4'>And thou shall be brought down, and shall speak out of the ground. And thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy voice shall be as of he who has a familiar spirit, out of the ground. And thy speech shall whisper out of the d</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.5'>But the multitude of thy foes shall be like small dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that passes away. Yea, it shall be in an instant suddenly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.6'>She shall be visited by LORD of hosts with thunder, and with earthquake, and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest, and the flame of a devouring fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.7'>And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel, even all that fight against her and her stronghold, and that distress her, shall be as a dream, a vision of the night.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.8'>And it shall be as when a hungry man dreams, and, behold, he eats. But he awakes, and his soul is empty. Or as when a thirsty man dreams, and, behold, he drinks. But he awakes, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul has appetite. S</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.9'>Tarry ye and wonder, take your pleasure and be blind. They are drunken, but not with wine. They stagger, but not with strong drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.10'>For LORD has poured out upon you the spirit of deep sleep, and has closed your eyes. The prophets, and your heads, the seers, he has covered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.11'>And all vision has become to you as the words of a book that is sealed, which men deliver to a man who is learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I cannot, for it is sealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.12'>And the book is delivered to him who is not learned, saying, Read this, I pray thee. And he says, I am not learned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.13'>And LORD said, Inasmuch as this people draw near [me] with their mouth, and honor me with their lips, but have removed their heart far from me, but in vain they worship me (LXX/NT), {teaching the commandments and doctrines of men</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.14'>Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvelous work among this people, even a marvelous work and a wonder. I will destroy the wisdom of the wise (LXX/NT), and the understanding of their prudent men shall be hidden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.15'>Woe to those who hide deep their counsel from LORD, and whose works are in the dark, and who say, Who sees us? and, Who knows us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.16'>Ye turn things upside down! Shall the potter be esteemed as clay, that the thing made should say of him who made it, He did not make me, or the thing formed say of him who formed it, He has no understanding?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.17'>Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be esteemed as a forest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.18'>And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity and out of darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.19'>The meek also shall increase their joy in LORD, and the poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.20'>For the terrible one is brought to nothing, and the scoffer ceases. And all those who watch for iniquity are cut off,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.21'>who make a man an offender in [his] cause, and lay a snare for him who reproves in the gate, and turn aside the just with a thing of nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.22'>Therefore thus says LORD, who redeemed Abraham, concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed, nor shall his face now grow pale.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.23'>But when he sees his children, the work of my hands, in the midst of him, they shall sanctify my name. Yea, they shall sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall stand in awe of the God of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.29.24'>They also who err in spirit shall come to understanding, and those who murmur shall receive instruction.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.30.2'>who set out to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my mouth, to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh, and to take refuge in the shadow of Egypt!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.3'>Therefore the strength of Pharaoh shall be your shame, and the refuge in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.4'>For their rulers are at Zoan, and their ambassadors have come to Hanes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.5'>They shall all be ashamed because of a people who cannot profit them, who are not a help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.6'>The burden of the beasts of the South. Through the land of trouble and anguish, from where come the lioness and the lion, the viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon the shoulders of young donkeys, and their tr</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.7'>For Egypt helps in vain, and to no purpose. Therefore I have called her Rahab who sits still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.8'>Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and inscribe it on a scroll, that it may be for the time to come forever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.9'>For it is a rebellious people, lying sons, sons who will not hear the law of LORD,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.10'>who say to the seers, Do not see, and to the prophets, Do not prophesy to us right things. Speak to us smooth things. Prophesy deceits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.11'>You get out of the way. Turn aside out of the path. Cause the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.12'>Therefore thus says the Holy One of Israel, Because ye despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness, and rely on it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.13'>therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking comes suddenly in an instant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.14'>And he shall break it as a potter's vessel is broken, breaking it in pieces without sparing, so that there shall not be found among the pieces of it a shard with which to take fire from the hearth, or to dip up water out of the cis</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.15'>For thus said lord LORD, the Holy One of Israel, Ye shall be saved in returning and rest. Your strength shall be in quietness and in confidence. And ye would not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.16'>but ye said, No, for we will flee upon horses. Therefore ye shall flee. And [ye said], We will ride upon the swift. Therefore those who pursue you shall be swift.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.17'>One thousand [shall flee] at the threat of one. Ye shall flee at the threat of five, till ye are left as a beacon upon the top of a mountain, and as an ensign on a hill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.18'>And therefore LORD will wait, that he may be gracious to you. And therefore he will be exalted, that he may have mercy upon you. For LORD is a God of justice. Blessed are all those who wait for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.19'>For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem. Thou shall weep no more. He will surely be gracious to thee at the voice of thy cry. When he shall hear, he will answer thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.20'>And though LORD give you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, yet thy teachers shall not be hidden anymore, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.21'>And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is the way, walk ye in it when ye turn to the right hand, and when ye turn to the left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.22'>And ye shall defile the overlaying of thy graven images of silver, and the plating of thy molten images of gold. Thou shall cast them away as an unclean thing. Thou shall say to it, Get thee away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.23'>And he will give the rain for thy seed, with which thou shall sow the ground, and bread of the increase of the ground, and it shall be fat and plenteous. In that day thy cattle shall feed in large pastures.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.24'>Likewise the oxen and the young donkeys that till the ground shall eat savory provender, which has been winnowed with the shovel and with the fork.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.30.26'>Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light of seven days, in the day that LORD binds up the hurt of his people, and heals the stroke of their wound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.27'>Behold, the name of LORD comes from far, burning with his anger, and in thick rising smoke. His lips are full of indignation, and his tongue is as a devouring fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.28'>and his breath is as an overflowing stream that reaches even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction. And a bridle that causes to err [shall be] in the jaws of the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.29'>Ye shall have a song as in the night when a holy feast is kept, and gladness of heart, as he who goes with a pipe to come to the mountain of LORD, to the Rock of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.30'>And LORD will cause his glorious voice to be heard, and will show the coming down of his arm with the indignation of [his] anger, and the flame of a devouring fire, with a blast and tempest and hailstones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.31'>For through the voice of LORD the Assyrian shall be dismayed. With his rod he will smite [him].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.32'>And every stroke of the appointed staff, which LORD shall lay upon him, shall be with [the sound of] tambourine and harps. And he will fight with them in battles with the brandishing [of his arm].</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.30.33'>For a Topheth is prepared of old, yea, it is made ready for the king. He has made it deep and large. The pile of it is fire and much wood. The breath of LORD kindles it, like a stream of brimstone.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.31.1'>Woe to those who go down to Egypt for help, and rely on horses, and trust in chariots because they are many, and in horsemen because they are very strong, but they look not to the Holy One of Israel, nor seek LORD!</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.31.3'>Now the Egyptians are men, and not God, and their horses flesh, and not spirit. And when LORD shall stretch out his hand, both he who helps shall stumble, and he who is helped shall fall, and they shall all be consumed together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.31.4'>For thus says LORD to me, As the lion and the young lion growling over his prey, [even] if a multitude of shepherds are called forth against him, he will not be dismayed at their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them, so L</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.54.2'>Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the curtains of thy habitations. Spare not. Lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy stakes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.3'>For thou shall spread aboard on the right hand and on the left. And thy seed shall possess the nations, and make the desolate cities to be inhabited.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.4'>Fear not, for thou shall not be ashamed. Neither be thou confounded, for thou shall not be put to shame. For thou shall forget the shame of thy youth. And the reproach of thy widowhood thou shall remember no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.5'>For thy maker is thy husband. LORD of hosts is his name. And the Holy One of Israel is thy Redeemer. He shall be called the God of the whole earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.6'>For LORD has called thee as a wife forsaken and grieved in spirit. Even a wife of youth when she is cast off, says thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.7'>For a small moment I have forsaken thee, but with great mercies I will gather thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.8'>In overflowing wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment, but with everlasting loving kindness I will have mercy on thee, says LORD thy Redeemer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.9'>For this is [as] the waters of Noah to me. For as I have sworn that the waters of Noah shall no more go over the earth, so I have sworn that I will not be angry with thee, nor rebuke thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.10'>For the mountains may depart, and the hills be removed, but my loving kindness shall not depart from thee, nor shall my covenant of peace be removed, says LORD who has mercy on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.11'>O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted, behold, I will set thy stones in fair colors, and lay thy foundations with sapphires.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.12'>And I will make thy pinnacles of rubies, and thy gates of carbuncles, and all thy border of precious stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.13'>And all thy sons shall be taught of LORD, and great shall be the peace of thy sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.14'>Thou shall be established in righteousness. Thou shall be far from oppression, for thou shall not fear, and from terror, for it shall not come near thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.15'>Behold, they may gather together, but not by me. Whoever shall gather together against thee shall fall because of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.16'>Behold, I have created the smith who blows the fire of coals, and brings forth a weapon for his work. And I have created the waster to destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.54.17'>No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper. And every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of LORD, and their righteousness which is of me, says LORD.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.55.1'>Ho, everyone who thirsts, come ye to the waters. And he who has no money, come ye, buy, and eat. Yea, come, buy wine and milk without money and without price.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.55.10'>For as the rain comes down and the snow from heaven, and returns not there, but waters the earth, and makes it bring forth and bud, and gives seed to the sower and bread to the eater,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.55.11'>so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth. It shall not return to me void, but it shall accomplish that which I please. And it shall prosper in the thing to which I sent it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.55.13'>Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree. And it shall be to LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.58.2'>Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways. As a nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance of their God, they ask of me righteous judgments; they delight to draw near to God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.58.3'>Why have we fasted, [they say], and thou see not? We have afflicted our soul, and thou take no knowledge. Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure, and exact from all your laborers.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.59.2'>But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you so that he will not hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.3'>For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity. Your lips have spoken lies. Your tongue mutters wickedness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.4'>No man sues in righteousness, and no man pleads in truth. They trust in vanity, and speak lies. They conceive mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.5'>They hatch adders' eggs, and weave the spider's web. He who eats of their eggs dies, and that which is crushed breaks out into a viper.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.6'>Their webs shall not become garments, nor shall they cover themselves with their works. Their works are works of iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.59.8'>They do not know the way of peace, and there is no justice in their goings. They have made them crooked paths. Whoever goes in it does not know peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.9'>Therefore justice is far from us, nor does righteousness overtake us. We look for light, but, behold, darkness, for brightness, but we walk in obscurity.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.59.11'>We all roar like bears, and moan greatly like doves. We look for justice, but there is none, for salvation, but it is far off from us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.12'>For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our sins testify against us. For our transgressions are with us, and as for our iniquities, we know them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.13'>transgressing and denying LORD, and turning away from following our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.14'>And justice is turned away backward, and righteousness stands afar off. For truth has fallen in the street, and uprightness cannot enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.15'>Yea, truth is lacking, and he who departs from evil makes himself a prey. And LORD saw it, and it displeased him that there was no justice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.16'>And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was no intercessor. Therefore his own arm brought salvation to him. And his righteousness, it upheld him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.17'>And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet of salvation upon his head. And he put on garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a mantle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.18'>According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, wrath to his adversaries, recompense to his enemies. He will repay recompense to the islands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.19'>So they shall fear the name of LORD from the west, and his glory from the rising of the sun. For he will come as a rushing stream, which the breath of LORD drives.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.20'>And he who redeems will come to Zion, and to those who turn from transgression in Jacob, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.59.21'>And as for me, this is my covenant with them, says LORD: My Spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed</verse>

        <verse osisID='Isa.62.2'>And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings thy glory. And thou shall be called by a new name, which the mouth of LORD shall name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.3'>Thou shall also be a crown of beauty in the hand of LORD, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.4'>Thou shall no more be termed Forsaken, nor shall thy land any more be termed Desolate. But thou shall be called Hephzi-bah, and thy land Beulah, for LORD delights in thee, and thy land shall be married.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.5'>For as a young man marries a virgin, so shall thy sons marry thee. And as the bridegroom rejoices over the bride, so shall thy God rejoice over thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.6'>I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem. They shall never keep silent day nor night. Ye who are LORD's reminders, take ye no rest,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.7'>and give him no rest, till he establishes, and till he makes Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.8'>LORD has sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his strength, Surely I will no more give thy grain to be food for thine enemies, and foreigners shall not drink thy new wine, for which thou have labored.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.9'>But those who have garnered it shall eat it, and praise LORD. And those who have gathered it shall drink it in the courts of my sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.10'>Go through, go through the gates. Prepare ye the way of the people. Cast up, cast up the highway. Gather out the stones. Lift up an ensign for the peoples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.11'>Behold, LORD has proclaimed to the end of the earth, Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation comes. Behold, his reward is with him, and his recompense before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.62.12'>And they shall call them The holy people, The redeemed of LORD. And thou shall be called Sought out, A city not forsaken.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.63'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.1'>Who is this who comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah, this who is glorious in his apparel, marching in the greatness of his strength? I who speak in righteousness, mighty to save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.2'>Why are thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him who treads in the wine vat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.3'>I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples there was no man with me. Yea, I trod them in my anger, and trampled them in my wrath, and their lifeblood is sprinkled upon my garments, and I have stained all my raiment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.4'>For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of my redeemed has come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.5'>And I looked, and there was none to help. And I wondered that there was none to uphold. Therefore my own arm brought salvation to me. And my wrath, it upheld me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.6'>And I trod down the peoples in my anger, and made them drunk in my wrath, and I poured out their lifeblood on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.7'>I will make mention of the loving kindnesses of LORD, [and] the praises of LORD, according to all that LORD has bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel, which he has bestowed on them according to his merci</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.8'>For he said, Surely, they are my people, sons that will not deal falsely. So he was their Savior.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.9'>In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the [heavenly] agent of his presence saved them. In his love and in his pity he redeemed them. And he bore them, and carried them all the days of old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.10'>But they rebelled, and grieved his holy Spirit. Therefore he was turned to be their enemy, [and] himself fought against them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.11'>Then he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people, [saying], Where is he who brought them up out of the sea with the shepherds of his flock? Where is he who put his holy Spirit in the midst of them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.12'>who caused his glorious arm to go at the right hand of Moses, who divided the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.13'>who led them through the depths, as a horse in the wilderness, so that they stumbled not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.14'>As the cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of LORD caused them to rest. So thou led thy people to make thyself a glorious name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.15'>Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy holiness and of thy glory. Where are thy zeal and thy mighty acts? The yearning of thy heart and thy compassions are restrained toward me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.16'>For thou are our Father, though Abraham knows us not, and Israel does not acknowledge us, thou, O LORD, are our Father, our Redeemer, from everlasting is thy name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.17'>O LORD, why do thou make us to err from thy ways, and harden our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants' sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.18'>Thy holy people possessed [it] but a little while. Our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.63.19'>We have become as those over whom thou never bore rule, as those who were not called by thy name.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.64'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.1'>Oh that thou would rend the heavens, that thou would come down, that the mountains might quake at thy presence,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.2'>as when fire kindles the brushwood, [and] the fire causes the waters to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the nations may tremble at thy presence!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.3'>When thou did fearful things which we did not look for, thou came down; the mountains quaked at thy presence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.4'>For from of old men have not heard, nor perceived by the ear, neither has the eye seen, O God, besides thee, [what] he has prepared for him who waits for him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.5'>Thou meet him who rejoices and works righteousness, those who remember thee in thy ways. Behold, thou were angry, and we sinned. Therefore we have erred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.6'>For we have all become as unclean, and all our righteous acts are as a polluted garment. And we all fade as a leaf. And our iniquities, like the wind, take us away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.7'>And there is none who calls upon thy name, who stirs himself up to take hold of thee. For thou have hid thy face from us, and have consumed us through our iniquities.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.8'>But now, O LORD, thou are our Father. We are the clay, and thou our potter, and we are all the work of thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.9'>Be not angry very severely, O LORD, nor remember iniquity forever. Behold, look, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.10'>Thy holy cities have become a wilderness. Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.11'>Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised thee, is burned with fire, and all our pleasant places are laid waste.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.64.12'>Will thou restrain thyself for these things, O LORD? Will thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very severely?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.65'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.1'>I was manifested (LXX/NT) by those who did not ask for me (LXX/NT). I am found by those who did not seek me. I said, Behold me, behold me, to a nation that was not called by my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.2'>I have spread out my hands all the day to a disobedient and (LXX/NT) rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, according to their own thoughts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.3'>a people who provoke me to my face continually, sacrificing in gardens, and burning incense upon bricks,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.4'>who sit among the graves, and lodge in the secret places, who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in their vessels,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.5'>who say, Stand by thyself, do not come near to me, for I am holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that burns all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.6'>Behold, it is written before me. I will not keep silence, but will recompense. Yea, I will recompense into their bosom</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.7'>your own iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together, says LORD, [those] who have burned incense upon the mountains, and blasphemed me upon the hills. Therefore I will measure their former work into their bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.8'>Thus says LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster, and [a man] says, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in it, so I will do for my servants' sake, that I may not destroy them all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.9'>And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah an inheritor of my mountains. And my chosen shall inherit it, and my servants shall dwell there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.10'>And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor a place for herds to lay down in, for my people who have sought me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.11'>But ye who forsake LORD, who forget my holy mountain, who prepare a table for Fortune, and who fill up mingled wine to Destiny,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.12'>I will destine you to the sword, and ye shall all bow down to the slaughter. Because when I called, ye did not answer, when I spoke, ye did not hear, but ye did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not deli</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.13'>Therefore thus says lord LORD, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall be hungry. Behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall be thirsty. Behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.14'>Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall cry for sorrow of heart, and shall wail for vexation of spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.15'>And ye shall leave your name for a curse to my chosen, and lord LORD will kill thee. And he will call his servants by another name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.16'>so that he who blesses himself in the earth shall bless himself in the God of truth, and he who swears in the earth shall swear by the God of truth. Because the former troubles are forgotten, and because they are hid from my eyes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.17'>For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth, and the former things shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.18'>But be ye glad and rejoice forever in that which I create. For, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.19'>And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people. And there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping and the voice of crying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.20'>There shall be no more there an infant of days, nor an old man who has not filled his days. For the child shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred years old shall be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.21'>And they shall build houses, and inhabit them. And they shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.22'>They shall not build, and another inhabit. They shall not plant, and another eat. For as the days of a tree shall be the days of my people, and my chosen shall long enjoy the work of their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.23'>They shall not labor in vain, nor bring forth for calamity. For they are the seed of the blessed of LORD, and their offspring with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.24'>And it shall come to pass that, before they call, I will answer, and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.65.25'>The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and dust shall be the serpent's food. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, says LORD.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Isa.66'>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.1'>Thus says LORD, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What manner of house will ye build to me, and what place shall be my rest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.2'>For all these things my hand has made, and all these things came to be, says LORD. But to this man I will look, even to him who is poor and of a contrite spirit, and who trembles at my word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.3'>He who slaughters an ox is as he who kills a man. He who sacrifices a lamb, as he who breaks a dog's neck. He who offers an oblation, [as] swine's blood. He who burns frankincense, as he who blesses an idol. Yea, they have chosen t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.4'>I also will choose their delusions, and will bring their fears upon them. Because when I called, none answered. When I spoke, they did not hear. But they did that which was evil in my eyes, and chose that in which I did not delight</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.5'>Hear the word of LORD, ye who tremble at his word: Your brothers who hate you, who cast you out for my name's sake, have said, Let LORD be glorified, that we may see your joy. But it is those who shall be put to shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.6'>A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of LORD who renders recompense to his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.7'>Before she travailed, she brought forth. Before her pain came, she was delivered of a man-child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.8'>Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such things? Shall a land be born in one day? Shall a nation be brought forth at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth her sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.9'>Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth? says LORD. Shall I who cause to bring forth shut [the womb]? says thy God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.10'>Rejoice ye with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye who love her. Rejoice for joy with her, all ye who mourn over her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.11'>that ye may nurse and be satisfied with the breasts of her consolations, that ye may [get] milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.12'>For thus says LORD, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing stream. And ye shall nurse [thereof]. Ye shall be borne upon the side, and shall be dandled upon the knees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.13'>As one whom his mother comforts, so I will comfort you, and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.14'>And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall flourish like the tender grass. And the hand of LORD shall be known toward his servants, and he will have indignation against his enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.15'>For, behold, LORD will come with fire, and his chariots shall be like the whirlwind, to render his anger with fierceness, and his rebuke with flames of fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.16'>For by fire LORD will execute judgment, and by his sword, upon all flesh, and the slain of LORD shall be many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.17'>Those who sanctify themselves and purify themselves [to go] to the gardens, behind one in the midst, eating swine's flesh, and the abomination, and the mouse, they shall come to an end together, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.18'>For I [know] their works and their thoughts. [The time] comes, that I will gather all nations and tongues, and they shall come, and shall see my glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.19'>And I will set a sign among them, and I will send such as escape of them to the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and Lud, that draw the bow, to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar off, who have not heard my fame, nor have seen my glory, a</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.20'>And they shall bring all your brothers out of all the nations for an oblation to LORD, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and upon mules, and upon dromedaries, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, says LORD, as the sons of Isr</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.21'>And of them also I will take for priests [and] for Levites, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.22'>For as the new heavens and the new earth, which I will make, shall remain before me, says LORD, so shall your seed and your name remain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.23'>And it shall come to pass, that from one new moon to another, and from one Sabbath to another, all flesh shall come to worship before me, says LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Isa.66.24'>And they shall go forth, and look upon the dead bodies of the men who have transgressed against me. For their worm shall not die, nor shall their fire be quenched, and they shall be an abhorring to all flesh.</verse>
