        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.1'>Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word of LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be accomplished, LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.2'>Thus says Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth has LORD, the God of heaven, given me, and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.3'>Whoever there is among you of all his people, his God be with him, and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build the house of LORD, the God of Israel (he is God), which is in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.5'>Then the heads of fathers of Judah and Benjamin, and the priests, and the Levites, even all whose spirit God had stirred, rose up to go up to build the house of LORD which is in Jerusalem.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.7'>Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of Jerusalem, and had put in the house of his gods,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.8'>even those Cyrus king of Persia brought forth by the hand of Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them to Sheshbazzar, the ruler of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.9'>And this is the number of them: thirty platters of gold, a thousand platters of silver, twenty-nine knives,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.1.10'>thirty bowls of gold, four hundred and ten silver bowls of a second sort, and a thousand other vessels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.3'>And they set the altar upon its base, for fear was upon them because of the peoples of the countries. And they offered burnt-offerings on it to LORD, even burnt-offerings morning and evening.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.4'>And they kept the feast of tabernacles as it is written, and [offered] the daily burnt-offerings by number according to the ordinance, as the duty of every day required.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.6'>From the first day of the seventh month they began to offer burnt-offerings to LORD. But the foundation of the temple of LORD was not yet laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.7'>Also they gave money to the masons, and to the carpenters, and food, and drink, and oil, to those of Sidon, and to those of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea, to Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.8'>Now in the second year of their coming to the house of God at Jerusalem, in the second month, Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the rest of their brothers the priests and the Levites, and all those</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.11'>And they sang one to another in praising and giving thanks to LORD, [saying], For he is good, for his loving kindness [is] forever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great shout, when they praised LORD, because the fo</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.12'>But many of the priests and Levites and heads of fathers, the old men who had seen the first house, when the foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with a loud voice, and many shouted aloud for joy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.3.13'>So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of joy from the noise of the weeping of the people, for the people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar off.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.1'>Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the sons of the captivity were building a temple to LORD, the God of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.2'>then they drew near to Zerubbabel, and to the heads of fathers, and said to them, Let us build with you, for we seek your God, as ye do, and we sacrifice to him since the days of Esar-haddon king of Assyria who brought us up here.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.3'>But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of fathers of Israel, said to them, Ye have nothing to do with us in building a house to our God, but we ourselves together will build to LORD, the God of Israel, as king Cyrus</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.4'>Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people of Judah, and troubled them in building,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.5'>and hired counselors against them to frustrate their purpose all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.6'>And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign, they wrote an accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.7'>And in the days of Artaxerxes, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of his companions, wrote to Artaxerxes king of Persia. And the writing of the letter was written in the Syrian [character], and set forth in the Syrian [tongu</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.8'>Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.9'>Then [wrote] Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of their companions, the Dinaites, and the Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the Archevites, the Babylonians, the Shushanchites, the Dehaites,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.10'>and the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Osnappar brought over, and set in the city of Samaria, and in the rest beyond the River, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.11'>This is a copy of the letter that they sent to Artaxerxes the king: Thy servants the men beyond the River, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.12'>Be it known to the king, that the Jews who came up from thee have come to us to Jerusalem. They are building the rebellious and the evil city, and have finished the walls, and repaired the foundations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.13'>Be it known now to the king, that, if this city be built, and the walls finished, they will not pay tribute, custom, or toll, and in the end it will be hurtful to the kings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.14'>Now because we eat the salt of the palace, and it is not fitting for us to see the king's dishonor, therefore we have sent and certified to the king,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.15'>that search may be made in the book of the records of thy fathers. So thou shall find in the book of the records, and know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful to kings and provinces. And that they have made sedition wi</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.16'>We certify to the king that, if this city be built, and the walls finished, by this means thou shall have no portion beyond the River.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.17'>[Then] the king sent an answer to Rehum the chancellor, and to Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions who dwell in Samaria, and in the rest beyond the River: Peace, and so forth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.18'>The letter which ye sent to us has been plainly read before me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.19'>And I decreed, and search has been made. And it is found that this city of old time has made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made in it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.20'>There have also been mighty kings over Jerusalem who have ruled over all [the country] beyond the River, and tribute, custom, and toll, was paid to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.21'>Make ye now a decree to cause these men to cease, and that this city not be built until a decree shall be made by me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.22'>And take heed that ye be not slack in this matter. Why should damage grow to the hurt of the kings?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.23'>Then when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they went in haste to Jerusalem to the Jews, and made them cease by force and power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.4.24'>Then the work of the house of God which is at Jerusalem ceased, and it ceased until the second year of the reign of Darius king of Persia.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezra.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.1'>Now the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son of Iddo, prophesied to the Jews who were in Judah and Jerusalem, in the name of the God of Israel, to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.2'>Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, rose up and began to build the house of God which is at Jerusalem, and with them were the prophets of God, helping them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.3'>At the same time Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and their companions, came to them, and said thus to them, Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.4'>Then we told them after this manner, [that is] what the names of the men were who were making this building.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.5'>But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, and they did not make them cease till the matter should come to Darius, and then answer should be returned by letter concerning it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.6'>The copy of the letter that Tattenai, the governor beyond the River, and Shethar-bozenai, and his companions the Apharsachites, who were beyond the River, sent to Darius the king;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.7'>they sent a letter to him, in which was written thus: To Darius the king, all peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.8'>Be it known to the king, that we went into the province of Judah to the house of the great God, which is built with great stones, and timber is laid in the walls. And this work goes on with diligence and prospers in their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.9'>Then we asked those elders, and said to them thus: Who gave you a decree to build this house, and to finish this wall?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.10'>Also, we asked them their names, to certify to thee, that we might write the names of the men who were at the head of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.11'>And thus they returned us an answer, saying, We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth. And are building the house that was built these many years ago, which a great king of Israel built and finished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.12'>But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven to wrath. He gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and carried the people away into Babylon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.13'>But in the first year of Cyrus king of Babylon, Cyrus the king made a decree to build this house of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezra.5.14'>And also the gold and silver vessels of the house of God, which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in Jerusalem, and brought into the temple of Babylon, those Cyrus the king took out of the temple of Babylon, and they w</verse>
