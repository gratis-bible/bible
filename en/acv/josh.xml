      <chapter osisID='Josh.1'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.1'>Now it came to pass after the death of Moses the servant of LORD, that LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses' minister, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.2'>Moses my servant is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, to the land which I give to them, even to the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.3'>Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, to you I have given it, as I spoke to Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.4'>From the wilderness, and this Lebanon, even to the great river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and to the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be your border.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.5'>There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee. I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.6'>Be strong and of good courage, for thou shall cause this people to inherit the land which I swore to their fathers to give them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.7'>Only be strong and very courageous to observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant commanded thee. Turn not from it to the right hand or to the left, that thou may have good success wherever thou go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.8'>This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shall meditate on it day and night, that thou may observe to do according to all that is written in it, for then thou shall make thy way prosperous, and then thou sha</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.9'>Have I not commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage. Be not frightened, neither be thou dismayed, for LORD thy God is with thee wherever thou go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.10'>Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.11'>Pass through the midst of the camp, and command the people, saying, Prepare food for you, for within three days ye are to pass over this Jordan to go in to possess the land, which LORD your God gives you to possess it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.12'>And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.13'>Remember the word which Moses the servant of LORD commanded you, saying, LORD your God gives you rest, and will give you this land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.14'>Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall abide in the land which Moses gave you beyond the Jordan, but ye shall pass over before your brothers armed, all the mighty men of valor, and shall help them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.15'>until LORD has given your brothers rest, as you, and they also have possessed the land which LORD your God gives them. Then ye shall return to the land of your possession, and possess it, which Moses the servant of LORD gave you be</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.16'>And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou have commanded us we will do, and wherever thou send us we will go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.17'>According as we hearkened to Moses in all things, so will we hearken to thee. Only LORD thy God be with thee, as he was with Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.1.18'>Whoever he is who shall rebel against thy commandment, and shall not hearken to thy words in all that thou command him, he shall be put to death. Only be strong and of good courage.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Josh.2'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.1'>And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men as spies secretly, saying, Go, view the land, and Jericho. And they went and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lay there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.2'>And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, men came in here tonight of the sons of Israel to search out the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.3'>And the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, Bring forth the men who came to thee, who have entered into thy house, for they have come to search out all the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.4'>And the woman took the two men, and hid them. And she said, Yes, the men came to me, but I did not know from where they were.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.5'>And it came to pass about the time of the shutting of the gate, when it was dark, that the men went out. Where the men went I know not. Pursue after them quickly, for ye will overtake them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.6'>But she had brought them up to the roof, and hid them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.7'>And the men pursued after them the way to the Jordan to the fords, and as soon as those who pursued after them were gone out, they shut the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.8'>And before they were laid down, she came up to them upon the roof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.9'>And she said to the men, I know that LORD has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us. And that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.10'>For we have heard how LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when ye came out of Egypt, and what ye did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.11'>And as soon as we had heard it, our hearts melted, neither did there remain any more spirit in any man, because of you, for LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and on earth beneath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.12'>Now therefore, I pray you, swear to me by LORD, since I have dealt kindly with you, that ye also will deal kindly with my father's house, and give me a TRUE token,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.13'>and that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my brothers, and my sisters, and all that they have, and will deliver our lives from death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.14'>And the men said to her, Our life for yours if ye do not utter this our business. And it shall be, when LORD gives us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.15'>Then she let them down by a cord through the window, for her house was upon the side of the wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.16'>And she said to them, Get you to the mountain lest the pursuers come upon you. And hide yourselves there three days, until the pursuers be returned, and afterward ye may go your way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.17'>And the men said to her, We will be guiltless of this thine oath which thou have made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.18'>Behold, when we come into the land, thou shall bind this line of scarlet cord in the window which thou let us down by. And thou shall gather to thee into the house thy father, and thy mother, and thy brothers, and all thy father's</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.19'>And it shall be, that whoever shall go out of the doors of thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head, and we shall be guiltless. And whoever shall be with thee in the house, his blood shall be on our head if any h</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.20'>But if thou utter this our business, then we shall be guiltless of thine oath which thou have made us to swear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.21'>And she said, According to your words, so be it. And she sent them away, and they departed. And she bound the scarlet line in the window.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.22'>And they went, and came to the mountain, and abode there three days, until the pursuers were returned. And the pursuers sought them throughout all the way, but did not find them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.23'>Then the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun. And they told him all that had befallen them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.2.24'>And they said to Joshua, Truly LORD has delivered into our hands all the land, and moreover all the inhabitants of the land melt away before us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.3'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.1'>And Joshua rose up early in the morning. And they moved from Shittim, and came to the Jordan, he and all the sons of Israel, and they lodged there before they passed over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.2'>And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went through the midst of the camp,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.3'>and they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of the covenant of LORD your God, and the priests the Levites bearing it, then ye shall move from your place, and go after it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.4'>Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two thousand cubits by measure. Do not come near to it, that ye may know the way by which ye must go, for ye have not passed this way heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.5'>And Joshua said to the people, Sanctify yourselves, for tomorrow LORD will do wonders among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.6'>And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, Take up the ark of the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.7'>And LORD said to Joshua, This day I will begin to magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.8'>And thou shall command the priests who bear the ark of the covenant, saying, When ye have come to the brink of the waters of the Jordan, ye shall stand still in the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.9'>And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, Come here, and hear the words of LORD your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.10'>And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Hivite, and the Perizzite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.11'>Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passes over before you into the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.12'>Now therefore take for you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel, for every tribe a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.13'>And it shall come to pass, when the soles of the feet of the priests who bear the ark of LORD, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of the Jordan, that the waters of the Jordan shall be cut off, even the waters that</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.14'>And it came to pass, when the people moved from their tents to pass over the Jordan--the priests who bore the ark of the covenant being before the people--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.15'>and when those who bore the ark came to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests who bore the ark were dipped in the brink of the water (for the Jordan overflows all its banks all the time of harvest),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.16'>that the waters which came down from above, stood, and rose up in one heap a great way off, at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan, and those that went down toward the sea of the Arabah, even the Salt Sea, were wholly cut off. A</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.3.17'>And the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, and all Israel passed over on dry ground until all the nation were passed clean over the Jordan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.4'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.1'>And it came to pass, when all the nation were clean passed over the Jordan, that LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.2'>Take for you twelve men out of the people, a man out of every tribe,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.3'>and command ye them, saying, Take for you here out of the midst of the Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood firm, twelve stones, and carry them over with you, and lay them down in the lodging-place where ye shall</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.4'>Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the sons of Israel, a man out of every tribe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.5'>And Joshua said to them, Pass over before the ark of LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and take ye up every man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.6'>that this may be a sign among you, that, when your children ask in time to come, saying, What do ye mean by these stones?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.7'>Then ye shall say to them, Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of LORD. When it passed over the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. And these stones shall be for a memorial to the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.8'>And the sons of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, as LORD spoke to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and they carried them over with them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.9'>And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan, in the place where the feet of the priests who bore the ark of the covenant stood, and they are there to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.10'>For the priests who bore the ark stood in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that LORD commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all that Moses commanded Joshua. And the people hastened and passed ove</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.11'>And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed over, that the ark of LORD passed over, and the priests, in the presence of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.12'>And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the sons of Israel, as Moses spoke to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.13'>About forty thousand ready armed for war passed over before LORD to battle, to the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.14'>On that day LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all Israel, and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the days of his life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.15'>And LORD spoke to Joshua, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.16'>Command the priests who bear the ark of the testimony, that they come up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.17'>Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out of the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.18'>And it came to pass, when the priests who bore the ark of the covenant of LORD came up out of the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up to the dry ground, that the waters of the Jordan returned to t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.19'>And the people came up out of the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month, and encamped in Gilgal on the east border of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.20'>And those twelve stones, which they took out of the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.21'>And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, When your sons shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What do these stones mean?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.22'>Then ye shall let your sons know, saying, Israel came over this Jordan on dry land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.23'>For LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from before you, until ye were passed over, as LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up from before us, until we were passed over,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.4.24'>that all the peoples of the earth may know the hand of LORD, that it is mighty, that ye may fear LORD your God forever.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.5'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.1'>And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan westward, and all the kings of the Canaanites, who were by the sea, heard how that LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan from before the sons</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.2'>At that time LORD said to Joshua, Make for thee knives of flint, and circumcise again the sons of Israel the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.3'>And Joshua made him knives of flint, and circumcised the sons of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.4'>And this is the reason why Joshua circumcised: All the people who came forth out of Egypt, who were males, even all the men of war, died in the wilderness by the way after they came forth out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.5'>For all the people who came out were circumcised, but all the people who were born in the wilderness by the way as they came forth out of Egypt, they had not circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.6'>For the sons of Israel walked forty years in the wilderness till all the nation, even the men of war who came forth out of Egypt, were consumed, because they did not hearken to the voice of LORD, to whom LORD swore that he would no</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.7'>And their sons, whom he raised up in their stead, them Joshua circumcised, for they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them by the way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.8'>And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the nation, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they were recovered.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.9'>And LORD said to Joshua, This day I have rolled away the reproach of Egypt from off you. Therefore the name of that place was called Gilgal, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.10'>And the sons of Israel encamped in Gilgal. And they kept the Passover on the fourteenth day of the month at evening in the plains of Jericho.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.11'>And they ate of the produce of the land on the morrow after the Passover, unleavened cakes and parched grain, in the selfsame day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.12'>And the manna ceased on the morrow, after they had eaten of the produce of the land. Neither had the sons of Israel manna any more, but they ate of the fruit of the land of Canaan that year.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.13'>And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man opposite him with his sword drawn in his hand. And Joshua went to him, and said to him, Are thou for us, or for</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.14'>And he said, No, but [as] captain of the army of LORD I have now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and worshiped, and said to him, What does my lord say to his servant?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.5.15'>And the captain of LORD's army said to Joshua, Put off thy shoe from off thy foot, for the place on which thou stand is holy. And Joshua did so.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Josh.6'>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.1'>Now Jericho was shut up tight because of the sons of Israel. None went out, and none came in.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.2'>And LORD said to Joshua, See, I have given Jericho into thy hand, and the king of it, and the mighty men of valor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.3'>And ye shall encompass the city, all the men of war, going around the city once. Thus shall thou do six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.4'>And seven priests shall bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark. And the seventh day ye shall encompass the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.5'>And it shall be, that, when they make a long blast with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout. And the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people shall g</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.6'>And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said to them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.7'>And they said to the people, Pass on, and encompass the city, and let the armed men pass on before the ark of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.8'>And it was so, that, when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before LORD passed on, and blew the trumpets. And the ark of the covenant of LORD followed them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.9'>And the armed men went before the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rearward went behind the ark, [the priests] blowing the trumpets as they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.10'>And Joshua commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not shout, nor let your voice be heard, neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day I bid you shout. Then ye shall shout.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.11'>So he caused the ark of LORD to encompass the city, going around it once. And they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.12'>And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up the ark of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.13'>And the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of LORD went on continually, and blew the trumpets. And the armed men went before them, and the rearward came behind the ark of LORD, [the priests] blow</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.14'>And the second day they encompassed the city once, and returned into the camp. So they did six days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.15'>And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early at the dawning of the day, and encompassed the city according to the same manner seven times. Only on that day they encompassed the city seven times.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.16'>And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, Shout, for LORD has given you the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.17'>And the city shall be set apart, even it and all that is in it, to LORD. Only Rahab the harlot shall live, she and all who are with her in the house, because she hid the messengers that we sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.18'>But as for you, only keep yourselves from what is set apart, lest when ye have set it apart, ye take from what is set apart. So ye would make the camp of Israel accursed, and trouble it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Josh.6.19'>But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron, are holy to LORD. They shall come into the treasury of LORD.</verse>
