        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.1'>Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth [month], in the fifth [day] of the month, as I was among the captives by the river Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.2'>In the fifth [day] of the month, which was the fifth year of king Jehoiachin's captivity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.3'>the word of LORD came expressly to Ezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans by the river Chebar, and the hand of LORD was there upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.4'>And I looked, and, behold, a stormy wind came out of the north, a great cloud, with a fire enfolding itself, and a brightness round about it, and out of the midst of it, as it were glowing metal, out of the midst of the fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.5'>And out of the midst of it came the likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance. They had the likeness of a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.6'>And each one had four faces, and each one of them had four wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.7'>And their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their feet was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like burnished brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.8'>And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides. And those four had their faces and their wings [thus]:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.9'>Their wings were joined one to another. They did not turn when they went; they went each one straight forward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.10'>As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man. And those four had the face of a lion on the right side, and those four had the face of an ox on the left side, those four also had the face of an eagle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.11'>And their faces and their wings were separate above, two [wings] of each one were joined one to another, and two covered their bodies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.12'>And they went each one straight forward. Where the spirit was to go, they went. They did not turn when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.13'>As for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire, like the appearance of torches. It went up and down among the living creatures, and the fire was bright, and out of the fire went forth l</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.14'>And the living creatures ran and returned as the appearance of a flash of lightning.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.15'>Now as I beheld the living creatures, behold, one wheel [was] upon the earth beside the living creatures, for each of the four faces of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.16'>The appearance of the wheels and their work was like a beryl. And those four had one likeness, and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel within a wheel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.17'>When they went, they went in their four directions. They did not turn when they went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.18'>As for their rims, they were high and fearful. And those four had their rims full of eyes round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.19'>And when the living creatures went, the wheels went beside them. And when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.20'>Wherever the spirit was to go, they went; there the spirit was to go. And the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.21'>When those went, these went, and when those stood, these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up beside them, for the spirit of the living creature was in the wheels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.22'>And over the head of the living creature there was the likeness of a firmament, like awesome crystal to look upon, stretched forth over their heads above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.23'>And under the firmament their wings were straight, the one toward the other. Each one had two which covered their bodies on this side, and each one had two which covered on that side.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.24'>And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings like the noise of great waters, like the voice of the Almighty, a noise of tumult like the noise of a host. When they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.25'>And there was a voice above the firmament that was over their heads. When they stood, they let down their wings.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.26'>And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone. And upon the likeness of the throne was a likeness as the appearance of a man upon it above.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.27'>And I saw as it were glowing metal, as the appearance of fire within it round about, from the appearance of his loins and upward. And from the appearance of his loins and downward I saw as it were the appearance of fire. And there</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.1.28'>As the appearance of the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain, so was the appearance of the brightness round about. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of LORD. And when I saw it, I fell upon my face, and I</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.2'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.1'>And he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.2'>And the Spirit entered into me when he spoke to me, and set me upon my feet. And I heard him who spoke to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.3'>And he said to me, Son of man, I send thee to the sons of Israel, to nations that are rebellious, which have rebelled against me. They and their fathers have transgressed against me even to this very day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.4'>And the sons are impudent and stiff hearted. I send thee to them, and thou shall say to them, Thus says lord LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.5'>And they, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear (for they are a rebellious house), yet shall know that there has been a prophet among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.6'>And thou, son of man, be not afraid of them, nor be afraid of their words, though briers and thorns are with thee, and thou dwell among scorpions. Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebe</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.7'>And thou shall speak my words to them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear, for they are most rebellious.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.8'>But thou, son of man, hear what I say to thee. Be not thou rebellious like that rebellious house. Open thy mouth, and eat that which I give thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.9'>And when I looked, behold, a hand was put forth to me, and, lo, a roll of a book was in it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.2.10'>And he spread it before me, and it was written inside and outside. And there were written in it lamentations and mourning and woe.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Ezek.3'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.1'>And he said to me, Son of man, eat that which thou find. Eat this roll, and go, speak to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.2'>So I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat the roll.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.3'>And he said to me, Son of man, cause thy belly to eat, and fill thy bowels with this roll that I give thee. Then I ate it, and it was in my mouth as honey for sweetness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.4'>And he said to me, Son of man, go, get thee to the house of Israel, and speak to them with my words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.5'>For thou are not sent to a people of a strange speech and of a hard language, but to the house of Israel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.6'>not to many peoples of a strange speech, and of a hard language, whose words thou cannot understand. Surely, if I sent thee to them, they would hearken to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.7'>But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee, for they will not hearken to me. For all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and of a stiff heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.8'>Behold, I have made thy face hard against their faces, and thy forehead hard against their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.9'>As an adamant, harder than flint, I have made thy forehead. Fear them not, nor be dismayed at their looks, though they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.10'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, all my words that I shall speak to thee, receive in thy heart, and hear with thine ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.11'>And go, get thee to those of the captivity, to the sons of thy people, and speak to them, and tell them, Thus says lord LORD, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.12'>Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great rushing, [saying], Blessed be the glory of LORD from his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.13'>And [I heard] the noise of the wings of the living creatures as they touched each other, and the noise of the wheels beside them, even the noise of a great rushing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.14'>So the Spirit lifted me up, and took me away. And I went in bitterness, in the heat of my spirit, and the hand of LORD was strong upon me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.15'>Then I came to those of the captivity at Tel-abib, who dwelt by the river Chebar, and to where they dwelt. And I sat there overwhelmed among them seven days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.16'>And it came to pass at the end of seven days, that the word of LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.17'>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel. Therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.18'>When I say to a wicked man, Thou shall surely die, and thou give him no warning, nor speak to warn the wicked man from his wicked way, to save his life, the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.19'>Yet if thou warn the wicked man, and he does not turn from his wickedness, nor from his wicked way, he shall die in his iniquity, but thou have delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.20'>Again, when a righteous man turns from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, and I lay a stumbling block before him, he shall die. Because thou have not given him warning, he shall die in his sin, and his righteous deeds which h</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.21'>Nevertheless if thou warn the righteous man, that the righteous man not sin, and he does not sin, he shall surely live, because he took warning, and thou have delivered thy soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.22'>And the hand of LORD was there upon me, and he said to me, Arise, go forth into the plain, and I will talk with thee there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.23'>Then I arose, and went forth into the plain. And, behold, the glory of LORD stood there, as the glory which I saw by the river Chebar, and I fell on my face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.24'>Then the Spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet. And he spoke with me, and said to me, Go, shut thyself within thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.25'>But thou, son of man, behold, they shall lay bands upon thee, and shall bind thee with them, and thou shall not escape from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.26'>And I will make thy tongue cling to the roof of thy mouth, that thou shall be mute, and shall not be a reprover to them, for they are a rebellious house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.3.27'>But when I speak with thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shall say to them, Thus says lord LORD. He who hears, let him hear, and he who forbears, let him forbear, for they are a rebellious house.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.4'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.1'>Thou also, son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee, and portray upon it a city, even Jerusalem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.2'>And lay siege against it, and build forts against it, and cast up a mound against it. Also set camps against it, and plant battering rams against it round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.3'>And take thou to thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city. And set thy face toward it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shall lay siege against it. This shall be a sign to the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.4'>Moreover lay thou upon thy left side, and lay the iniquity of the house of Israel upon it. [According to] the number of the days that thou shall lay upon it, thou shall bear their iniquity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.5'>For I have appointed the years of their iniquity to be a number of days to thee, even three hundred and ninety days. So thou shall bear the iniquity of the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.6'>And again, when thou have accomplished these, thou shall lay on thy right side, and shall bear the iniquity of the house of Judah forty days, each day for a year. I have appointed it to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.7'>And thou shall set thy face toward the siege of Jerusalem, with thine arm uncovered, and thou shall prophesy against it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.8'>And, behold, I lay bands upon thee, and thou shall not turn thee from one side to the other, till thou have accomplished the days of thy siege.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.9'>Also take thou to thee wheat, and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and spelt, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread of it, [according to] the number of the days that thou shall lay upon thy side, even three hun</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.10'>And thy food which thou shall eat shall be by weight, twenty shekels a day. Thou shall eat it from time to time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.11'>And thou shall drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin. Thou shall drink from time to time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.12'>And thou shall eat it as barley cakes, and thou shall bake it in their sight with dung that comes out of man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.13'>And LORD said, Even thus shall the sons of Israel eat their bread unclean among the nations where I will drive them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.14'>Then I said, Ah lord LORD! Behold, my soul has not been polluted. For from my youth up even till now I have not eaten of that which dies of itself, or is torn of beasts, neither has abominable flesh come into my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.15'>Then he said to me, See, I have given thee cow's dung for man's dung, and thou shall prepare thy bread of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.16'>Moreover he said to me, Son of man, behold, I will break the staff of bread in Jerusalem, and they shall eat bread by weight, and with fearfulness, and they shall drink water by measure, and in dismay,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.4.17'>that they may lack bread and water, and be dismayed one with another, and pine away in their iniquity.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.5'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.1'>And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp sword. [As] a barber's razor thou shall take it to thee, and shall cause it to pass upon thy head and upon thy beard. Then take thee balances to weigh and divide the hair.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.2'>A third part thou shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city when the days of the siege are fulfilled, and thou shall take a third part, and smite with the sword round about it, and a third part thou shall scatter to the wind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.3'>And thou shall take from it a few in number, and bind them in thy skirts.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.4'>And of these again thou shall take, and cast them into the midst of the fire, and burn them in the fire. From there a fire shall come forth into all the house of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.5'>Thus says lord LORD: This is Jerusalem. I have set her in the midst of the nations, and countries are round about her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.6'>And she has rebelled against my ordinances in doing wickedness more than the nations, and against my statutes more than the countries that are round about her, for they have rejected my ordinances, and as for my statutes, they have</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.7'>Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because ye are more disorderly than the nations that are round about you, and have not walked in my statutes, nor have kept my ordinances, no, ye have not even done according to the ordinances of the</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.8'>therefore thus says lord LORD: Behold, I, even I, am against thee, and I will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.9'>And I will do in thee that which I have not done, and of which I will not do any more the like, because of all thine abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.10'>Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers. And I will execute judgments on thee, and I will scatter to all the winds the whole remnant of thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.11'>Therefore, as I live, says lord LORD, surely, because thou have defiled my sanctuary with all thy detestable things, and with all thine abominations, therefore I also will diminish [thee], nor shall my eye spare. And I also will ha</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.12'>A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and they shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee, and a third part shall fall by the sword round about thee, and a third part I will scatter to all the winds, and will</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.13'>Thus my anger shall be accomplished, and I will cause my wrath toward them to rest, and I shall be comforted. And they shall know that I, LORD, have spoken in my zeal, when I have accomplished my wrath upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.14'>Moreover I will make thee a desolation and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of all who pass by.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.15'>So it shall be a reproach and a taunt, a lesson and an astonishment, to the nations that are round about thee, when I shall execute judgments on thee in anger and in wrath, and in wrathful rebukes--I, LORD, have spoken it--</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.16'>when I shall send upon them the evil arrows of famine that are for destruction, which I will send to destroy you. And I will increase the famine upon you, and will break your staff of bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.5.17'>And I will send upon you famine and evil beasts, and they shall bereave thee. And pestilence and blood shall pass through thee. And I will bring the sword upon thee. I, LORD, have spoken it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.10'>And they shall know that I am LORD. I have not said in vain that I would do this evil to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.11'>Thus says lord LORD: Smite with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say, Alas! because of all the evil abominations of the house of Israel, for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.6.12'>He who is far off shall die of the pestilence, and he who is near shall fall by the sword, and he who remains and is besieged shall die by the famine. Thus I will accomplish my wrath upon them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Ezek.7'>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.1'>Moreover the word of LORD came to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.2'>And thou, son of man, thus says lord LORD to the land of Israel: An end. The end has come upon the four corners of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.7.3'>Now the end is upon thee, and I will send my anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways. And I will bring upon thee all thine abominations.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.1'>The word of LORD came again to me, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.2'>Son of man, there were two women, the daughters of one mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.3'>And they played the harlot in Egypt. They played the harlot in their youth. There their breasts were pressed, and there was handled the bosom of their virginity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.4'>And the names of them were Oholah the elder, and Oholibah her sister. And they became mine, and they bore sons and daughters. And as for their names, Samaria is Oholah, and Jerusalem Oholibah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.5'>And Oholah played the harlot when she was mine, and she doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians [her] neighbors,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.6'>who were clothed with blue, governors and rulers, all of them desirable young men, horsemen riding upon horses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.7'>And she bestowed her whoredoms upon them, the choicest men of Assyria all of them. And on whomever she doted, with all their idols she defiled herself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.8'>Neither has she left her whoredoms since Egypt. For in her youth they lay with her, and they handled the bosom of her virginity, and they poured out their whoredom upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.9'>Therefore I delivered her into the hand of her lovers, into the hand of the Assyrians, upon whom she doted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.10'>These uncovered her nakedness. They took her sons and her daughters, and they killed her with the sword. And she became a byword among women, for they executed judgments upon her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.11'>And her sister Oholibah saw this, yet she was more corrupt in her doting than she, and in her whoredoms which were more than the whoredoms of her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.12'>She doted upon the Assyrians, governors and rulers, [her] neighbors, clothed most gorgeously, horsemen riding upon horses, all of them desirable young men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.13'>And I saw that she was defiled. They both took one way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.14'>And she increased her whoredoms, for she saw men portrayed upon the wall, the images of the Chaldeans portrayed with vermilion,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.15'>girded with belts upon their loins, with flowing turbans upon their heads, all of them rulers to look upon, according to the likeness of the Babylonians in Chaldea, the land of their nativity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.16'>And as soon as she saw them she doted upon them, and sent messengers to them into Chaldea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.17'>And the Babylonians came to her into the bed of love. And they defiled her with their whoredom, and she was polluted with them, and her soul was alienated from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.18'>So she uncovered her whoredoms, and uncovered her nakedness. Then my soul was alienated from her, just as my soul was alienated from her sister.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.19'>Yet she multiplied her whoredoms, remembering the days of her youth in which she had played the harlot in the land of Egypt.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.30'>These things shall be done to thee, because thou have played the harlot after the nations, and because thou are polluted with their idols.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.31'>Thou have walked in the way of thy sister, therefore I will give her cup into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.32'>Thus says lord LORD: Thou shall drink of thy sister's cup, which is deep and large. Thou shall be laughed to scorn and had in derision. It contains much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.33'>Thou shall be filled with drunkenness and sorrow, with the cup of astonishment and desolation, with the cup of thy sister Samaria.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.34'>Thou shall even drink it and drain it out. And thou shall gnaw the shards of it, and shall tear thy breasts, for I have spoken it, says lord LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.35'>Therefore thus says lord LORD: Because thou have forgotten me, and cast me behind thy back, therefore thou also bear thy lewdness and thy whoredoms.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.36'>LORD said moreover to me, Son of man, will thou judge Oholah and Oholibah? Then declare to them their abominations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.37'>For they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands. And with their idols they have committed adultery. And they have also caused their sons, whom they bore to me, to pass through [the fire] for them to be devoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.38'>Moreover they have done this to me: They have defiled my sanctuary in the same day, and have profaned my Sabbaths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.39'>For when they had slain their sons to their idols, then they came the same day into my sanctuary to profane it, and, lo, thus they have done in the midst of my house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.40'>And furthermore ye have sent for men who come from far, to whom a messenger was sent. And, lo, they came, for whom thou washed thyself, painted thine eyes, and decked thyself with ornaments,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.41'>and sat upon a stately bed, with a table prepared before it, whereupon thou did set my incense and my oil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.42'>And the voice of a multitude being at ease was with her. And with men of the common sort, were brought drunkards from the wilderness, and they put bracelets upon the hands of those [two women], and beautiful crowns upon their heads</verse>

        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.44'>And they went in to her, as they go in to a harlot. So they went in to Oholah and to Oholibah, the lewd women.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.45'>And righteous men, they shall judge them with the judgment of adulteresses, and with the judgment of women who shed blood, because they are adulteresses, and blood is on their hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.46'>For thus says lord LORD: I will bring up a company against them, and will give them to be tossed to and fro and robbed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.47'>And the company shall stone them with stones, and dispatch them with their swords. They shall kill their sons and their daughters, and burn up their houses with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.48'>Thus I will cause lewdness to cease out of the land, that all women may be taught not to do according to your lewdness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Ezek.23.49'>And they shall recompense your lewdness upon you, and ye shall bear the sins of your idols. And ye shall know that I am lord LORD.</verse>
