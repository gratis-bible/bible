      <chapter osisID='Lam.1'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.1'>How the city sits solitary, that was full of people! She has become as a widow, who was great among the nations! She who was a princess among the provinces has become tributary!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.2'>She weeps bitterly in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks. Among all her loved ones she has none to comfort her. All her friends have dealt treacherously with her, they have become her enemies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.3'>Judah has gone into captivity because of affliction. And because of great servitude she dwells among the nations. She finds no rest. All her persecutors overtook her in the distress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.4'>The ways of Zion mourn, because none come to the solemn assembly. All her gates are desolate. Her priests sigh. Her virgins are afflicted, and she herself is in bitterness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.5'>Her adversaries have become the head. Her enemies prosper. For LORD has afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions. Her young sons have gone into captivity before the adversary.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.6'>And from the daughter of Zion all her majesty is departed. Her rulers have become like harts that find no pasture. And they have gone without strength before the pursuer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.7'>Jerusalem remembers in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that were from the days of old. When her people fell into the hand of the adversary, and none helped her, the adversaries saw her; they m</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.8'>Jerusalem has grievously sinned, therefore she has become as an unclean thing. All who honored her despise her, because they have seen her nakedness. Yea, she sighs, and turns backward.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.9'>Her filthiness was in her skirts. She did not think of her latter end. Therefore she has come down astonishingly. She has no comforter. Behold, O LORD, my affliction, for the enemy has magnified himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.10'>The adversary has spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things. For she has seen that the nations have entered into her sanctuary, concerning whom thou commanded that they should not enter into thine assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.11'>All her people sigh. They seek bread. They have given their pleasant things for food to refresh the soul. See, O LORD, and, behold, for I have become abject.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.12'>Is it nothing to you, all ye who pass by? Behold, and see if there is any sorrow like my sorrow, which is brought upon me. Therewith LORD has afflicted in the day of his fierce anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.13'>From on high he has sent fire into my bones, and it prevails against them. He has spread a net for my feet. He has turned me back. He has made me desolate and faint all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.14'>The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand. They are knit together. They have come up upon my neck. He has made my strength to fail. LORD has delivered me into their hands, against whom I am not able to stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.15'>LORD has trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me. He has called a solemn assembly against me to crush my young men. LORD has trodden the virgin daughter of Judah as in a winepress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.16'>For these things I weep. My eye, my eye runs down with water, because the comforter who should refresh my soul is far from me. My sons are desolate, because the enemy has prevailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.17'>Zion spreads forth her hands. There is none to comfort her. LORD has commanded concerning Jacob, that those who are round about him should be his adversaries. Jerusalem is among them as an unclean thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.18'>LORD is righteous, for I have rebelled against his commandment. Hear, I pray you, all ye peoples, and behold my sorrow. My virgins and my young men have gone into captivity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.19'>I called for my loved ones, [but] they deceived me. My priests and my elders gave up the spirit in the city, while they sought food for themselves to refresh their souls.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.20'>Behold, O LORD, for I am in distress. My heart is troubled. My heart is turned within me. For I have grievously rebelled. Abroad the sword bereaves; at home there is as death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.21'>They have heard that I sigh. There is none to comfort me. All my enemies have heard of my trouble. They are glad that thou have done it. Thou will bring the day that thou have proclaimed, and they shall be like me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.1.22'>Let all their wickedness come before thee, and do to them, as thou have done to me for all my transgressions. For my sighs are many, and my heart is faint.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lam.2'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.1'>How LORD has covered the daughter of Zion with a cloud in his anger! He has cast down the beauty of Israel from heaven to the earth, and has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.2'>LORD has swallowed up all the habitations of Jacob, and has not pitied. In his wrath he has thrown down the strongholds of the daughter of Judah. He has brought them down to the ground. He has profaned the kingdom and the rulers th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.3'>In fierce anger he has cut off all the horn of Israel. He has drawn back his right hand from before the enemy. And he has burned up Jacob like a flaming fire which devours round about.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.4'>He has bent his bow like an enemy. He has stood with his right hand as an adversary, and has slain all who were pleasant to the eye. He has poured out his wrath like fire in the tent of the daughter of Zion.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.5'>LORD has become as an enemy. He has swallowed up Israel. He has swallowed up all her palaces. He has destroyed his strongholds. And he has multiplied mourning and lamentation in the daughter of Judah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.6'>And he has taken away his tabernacle violently, as a garden. He has destroyed his place of assembly. LORD has caused solemn assembly and Sabbath to be forgotten in Zion. And in the indignation of his anger has despised the king and</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.7'>LORD has cast off his altar. He has abhorred his sanctuary. He has given up the walls of her palaces into the hand of the enemy. They have made a noise in the house of LORD, as in the day of a solemn assembly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.8'>LORD has purposed to destroy the wall of the daughter of Zion. He has stretched out the line. He has not withdrawn his hand from destroying. And he has made the rampart and wall to lament, they languish together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.9'>Her gates are sunk into the ground. He has destroyed and broken her bars. Her king and her rulers are among the nations where the law is not. Yea, her prophets find no vision from LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.10'>The elders of the daughter of Zion sit upon the ground. They keep silence. They have cast up dust upon their heads. They have girded themselves with sackcloth. The virgins of Jerusalem hang down their heads to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.11'>My eyes fail with tears, my heart is troubled, my liver is poured upon the earth, because of the destruction of the daughter of my people, because the young sons and the sucklings faint in the streets of the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.12'>They say to their mothers, Where is grain and wine? when they faint as the wounded in the streets of the city, when their soul is poured out into their mothers' bosom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.13'>What shall I testify to thee? What shall I liken to thee, O daughter of Jerusalem? What shall I compare to thee, that I may comfort thee, O virgin daughter of Zion? For thy breach is great like the sea; who can heal thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.14'>Thy prophets have seen FALSE and foolish visions for thee. And they have not uncovered thine iniquity, to bring back thy captivity, but have seen for thee FALSE oracles and causes of banishment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.15'>All who pass by clap their hands at thee. They hiss and wag their head at the daughter of Jerusalem, [saying], Is this the city that men called The perfection of beauty, The joy of the whole earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.16'>All thine enemies have opened their mouth wide against thee. They hiss and gnash the teeth. They say, We have swallowed her up. Certainly this is the day that we looked for. We have found, we have seen it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.17'>LORD has done that which he purposed. He has fulfilled his word that he commanded in the days of old. He has thrown down, and has not pitied. And he has caused the enemy to rejoice over thee. He has exalted the horn of thine advers</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.18'>Their heart cried to LORD. O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night. Give thyself no respite. Let not the apple of thine eye cease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.19'>Arise, cry out in the night, at the beginning of the watches. Pour out thy heart like water before the face of LORD. Lift up thy hands toward him for the life of thy young sons, who faint for hunger at the head of every street.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.20'>See, O LORD, and behold to whom thou have done thus! Shall the women eat their fruit, the sons who are dandled in the hands? Shall the priest and the prophet be slain in the sanctuary of LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.21'>The youth and the old man lay on the ground in the streets. My virgins and my young men have fallen by the sword. Thou have slain them in the day of thine anger. Thou have slaughtered, [and] not pitied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.2.22'>Thou have called, as in the day of a solemn assembly, my terrors on every side. And there was none who escaped or remained in the day of LORD's anger. My enemy has consumed those whom I have dandled and brought up.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Lam.3'>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.1'>I am the man who has seen affliction by the rod of his wrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.2'>He has led me and caused me to walk in darkness, and not in light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.3'>Surely he turns his hand against me, again and again all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.4'>He has made my flesh and my skin old. He has broken my bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.5'>He has built against me, and encompassed me with gall and travail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.6'>He has made me to dwell in dark places, as those who have long been dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.7'>He has walled me around, that I cannot go forth. He has made my chain heavy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.8'>Yea, when I cry, and call for help, he shuts out my prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.9'>He has walled up my ways with hewn stone. He has made my paths crooked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.10'>He is to me as a bear laying in wait, as a lion in concealed places.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.11'>He has turned aside my ways, and pulled me in pieces. He has made me desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.12'>He has bent his bow, and set me as a mark for the arrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.13'>He has caused the shafts of his quiver to enter into my reins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.14'>I have become a derision to all my people, and their song all the day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.15'>He has filled me with bitterness. He has sated me with wormwood.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Lam.3.17'>And thou have removed my soul far off from peace. I forgot prosperity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.18'>And I said, My strength is perished, and my expectation from LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.19'>Remember my affliction and my misery, the wormwood and the gall.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.20'>My soul still has them in remembrance, and is bowed down within me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.21'>This I recall to my mind, therefore I have hope:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Lam.3.22'>[It is of] LORD's loving kindnesses that we are not consumed, because his compassions do not fail.</verse>
