      <chapter osisID='Judg.1'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.1'>And it came to pass after the death of Joshua, that the sons of Israel asked of LORD, saying, Who shall go up for us first against the Canaanites, to fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.2'>And LORD said, Judah shall go up. Behold, I have delivered the land into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.3'>And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites, and I likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.4'>And Judah went up, and LORD delivered the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they smote of them in Bezek ten thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.5'>And they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek, and they fought against him, and they smote the Canaanites and the Perizzites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.6'>But Adoni-bezek fled, and they pursued after him, and caught him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.7'>And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings, having their thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered [scraps] under my table. As I have done, so God has requited me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.8'>And the sons of Judah fought against Jerusalem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and set the city on fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.9'>And afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who dwelt in the hill-country, and in the South, and in the lowland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.10'>And Judah went against the Canaanites who dwelt in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba), and they smote Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.11'>And from there he went against the inhabitants of Debir. (Now the name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.12'>And Caleb said, He who smites Kiriath-sepher, and takes it, I will give to him Achsah my daughter to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.13'>And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took it, and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.14'>And it came to pass, when she came [to him], that she moved him to ask of her father a field. And she alighted from off her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What would thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.15'>And she said to him, Give me a blessing, since thou have set me in the land of the South, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the nether springs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.16'>And the sons of the Kenite, Moses' brother-in-law, went up out of the city of palm trees with the sons of Judah into the wilderness of Judah, which is in the south of Arad, and they went and dwelt with the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.17'>And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they smote the Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it. And the name of the city was called Hormah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.18'>Also Judah took Gaza with the border of it, and Ashkelon with the border of it, and Ekron with the border of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.19'>And LORD was with Judah, and drove out [those of] the hill-country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.20'>And they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had spoken, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.21'>And the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem, but the Jebusites dwell with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.22'>And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel, and LORD was with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.23'>And the house of Joseph sent to spy out Bethel. (Now the name of the city was formerly Luz.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.24'>And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they said to him, Show us, we pray thee, the entrance into the city, and we will deal kindly with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.25'>And he showed them the entrance into the city. And they smote the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man go and all his family.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.26'>And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a city, and called the name of it Luz, which is the name of it to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.27'>And Manasseh did not drive out [those of] Beth-shean and its towns, nor [of] Taanach and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and its towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.28'>And it came to pass, when Israel grew strong, that they put the Canaanites to task work, and did not utterly drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.29'>And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who dwelt in Gezer, but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.30'>Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor the inhabitants of Nahalol, but the Canaanites dwelt among them, and became subject to task work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.31'>Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, nor the inhabitants of Sidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.32'>but the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.33'>Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, nor the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but he dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became su</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.34'>And the Amorites forced the sons of Dan into the hill-country, for they would not allow them to come down to the valley,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.35'>but the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim. Yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so that they became subject to task work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.1.36'>And the border of the Amorites was from the ascent of Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.2'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.1'>And the agent of LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I made you go up out of Egypt, and have brought you to the land which I swore to your fathers. And I said, I will never break my covenant with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.2'>And ye shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land. Ye shall break down their altars. But ye have not hearkened to my voice. Why have ye done this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.3'>Therefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before you, but they shall be [as thorns] in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.4'>And it came to pass, when the agent of LORD spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, that the people lifted up their voice, and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.5'>And they called the name of that place Bochim, and they sacrificed there to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.6'>Now when Joshua had sent the people away, the sons of Israel went every man to his inheritance to possess the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.7'>And the people served LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of LORD that he had wrought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.8'>And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of LORD, died, being a hundred and ten years old.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.9'>And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of the mountain of Gaash.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.10'>And also all that generation were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them that did not know LORD, nor yet the work which he had wrought for Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.11'>And the sons of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and served the Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.12'>And they forsook LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the gods of the peoples that were round about them, and bowed themselves down to them. And they provoked LORD t</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.13'>And they forsook LORD, and served Baal and the Ashtaroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.14'>And the anger of LORD was kindled against Israel, and he delivered them into the hands of spoilers that despoiled them. And he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about, so that they could not any longer stand before th</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.15'>Wherever they went out, the hand of LORD was against them for evil, as LORD had spoken, and as LORD had sworn to them. And they were exceedingly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.16'>And LORD raised up judges who saved them out of the hand of those who despoiled them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.17'>And yet they did not hearken to their judges, for they played the harlot after other gods, and bowed themselves down to them. They turned aside quickly out of the way in which their fathers walked, obeying the commandments of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.18'>And when LORD raised up judges for them, then LORD was with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For LORD regretted because of their groaning because of those who oppressed them and</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.19'>But it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they turned back, and dealt more corruptly than their fathers, in following other gods to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not cease from their doings, nor from their</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.20'>And the anger of LORD was kindled against Israel, and he said, Because this nation has transgressed my covenant which I commanded their fathers, and has not hearkened to my voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.21'>I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of the nations that Joshua left when he died,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.22'>that by them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep the way of LORD to walk in it, as their fathers kept it, or not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.2.23'>So LORD left those nations, without driving them out quickly. Neither did he deliver them into the hand of Joshua.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.3'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.1'>Now these are the nations which LORD left to prove Israel by them, (even as many [of Israel] as had not known all the wars of Canaan,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.2'>only that the generations of the sons of Israel might know, to teach them war, at least to such as formerly knew nothing of that):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.3'>[namely], the five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites, and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount Lebanon, from mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.4'>And they were [left], to prove Israel by them, to know whether they would hearken to the commandments of LORD, which he commanded their fathers by Moses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.5'>And the sons of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites, the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.6'>And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave their own daughters to their sons and served their gods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.7'>And the sons of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and forgot LORD their God, and served the Baalim and the Asheroth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.8'>Therefore the anger of LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia, And the sons of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.9'>And when the sons of Israel cried to LORD, LORD raised up a savior to the sons of Israel, who saved them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.10'>And the Spirit of LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. And he went out to war, and LORD delivered Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, and his hand prevailed against Cushan-rishathaim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.11'>And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of Kenaz died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.12'>And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of LORD. And LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel because they had done that which was evil in the sight of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.13'>And he gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and he went and smote Israel, and they possessed the city of palm trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.14'>And the sons of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.15'>But when the sons of Israel cried to LORD, LORD raised up for them a savior, Ehud the son of Gera, the Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the sons of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.16'>And Ehud made for himself a sword which had two edges, a cubit in length. And he girded it under his raiment upon his right thigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.17'>And he offered the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.18'>And when he had made an end of offering the tribute, he sent away the men who bore the tribute.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.19'>But he himself turned back from the quarries that were by Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand to thee, O king. And he said, Keep silence. And all who stood by him went out from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.20'>And Ehud came to him. And he was sitting by himself alone in the cool upper room. And Ehud said, I have a message from God to thee. And he arose out of his seat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.21'>And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.22'>And the handle also went in after the blade, and the fat closed upon the blade, for he did not draw the sword out of his body, and it came out behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.23'>Then Ehud went forth into the porch, and shut the doors of the upper room upon him, and locked them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.24'>Now when he was gone out, his servants came, and they saw, and, behold, the doors of the upper room were locked. And they said, Surely he is covering his feet in the upper chamber.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.25'>And they delayed till they were ashamed, and, behold, he did not open the doors of the upper room. Therefore they took the key, and opened, and, behold, their lord was fallen down dead on the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.26'>And Ehud escaped while they delayed, and passed beyond the quarries, and escaped to Seirah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.27'>And it came to pass, when he came, that he blew a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim. And the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill-country, and he before them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.28'>And he said to them, Follow after me, for LORD has delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they went down after him, and took the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites, and did not allow a man to pass over.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.29'>And they smote about ten thousand men of Moab at that time, every robust man, and every man of valor, and there escaped not a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.30'>So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest eighty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.3.31'>And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who smote six hundred men of the Philistines with an ox-goad, and he also saved Israel.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.4'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.1'>And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, when Ehud was dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.2'>And LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan who reigned in Hazor, the captain of whose army was Sisera who dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.3'>And the sons of Israel cried to LORD, for he had nine hundred chariots of iron, and he mightily oppressed the sons of Israel twenty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.4'>Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, she judged Israel at that time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.5'>And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the sons of Israel came up to her for judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.6'>And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, Has not LORD, the God of Israel, commanded, [saying], Go and approach to mount Tabor, and take with thee ten thousand men of the sons of Naph</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.7'>And I will draw Sisera, the captain of Jabin's army, to thee, to the river Kishon, with his chariots and his multitude, and I will deliver him into thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.8'>And Barak said to her, If thou will go with me, then I will go, but if thou will not go with me, I will not go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.9'>And she said, I will surely go with thee. Notwithstanding, the journey that thou take shall not be for thine honor, for LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.10'>And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali together to Kedesh. And there went up ten thousand men at his feet, and Deborah went up with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.11'>Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, even from the sons of Hobab the brother-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far as the oak in Zaanannim, which is by Kedesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.12'>And they told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone up to mount Tabor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.13'>And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles, to the river Kishon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.14'>And Deborah said to Barak, Up, for this is the day in which LORD has delivered Sisera into thy hand. Has not LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.15'>And LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all his army, with the edge of the sword before Barak. And Sisera alighted from his chariot, and fled away on his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.16'>But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the army, to Harosheth of the Gentiles. And all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword. There was not a man left.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.17'>However Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.18'>And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, Turn in, my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And he turned in to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.19'>And he said to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, and covered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.20'>And he said to her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it shall be, when any man comes and inquires of thee, and says, Is there any man here? that thou shall say, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.21'>Then Jael Heber's wife took a tent-pin, and took a hammer in her hand, and went softly to him, and struck the pin into his temples, and it pierced through into the ground, for he was in a deep sleep, so he fainted and died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.22'>And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him, and said to him, Come, and I will show thee the man whom thou seek. And he came to her, and, behold, Sisera lay dead, and the tent-pin was in his temples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.23'>So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.4.24'>And the hand of the sons of Israel prevailed more and more against Jabin the king of Canaan until they had destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Judg.5'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.1'>Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.2'>That the leaders took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless ye LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.5.3'>Hear, O ye kings. Give ear, O ye rulers. I, [even] I, will sing to LORD. I will sing praise to LORD, the God of Israel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.9.2'>Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem, Which is better for you, that all the sons of Jerubbaal, who are seventy men, rule over you, or that one rule over you? remember also that I am your bone and your flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.3'>And his mother's brothers spoke of him in the ears of all the men of Shechem all these words. And their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.4'>And they gave him seventy [pieces] of silver out of the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired vain and unstable fellows who followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.5'>And he went to his father's house at Ophrah, and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, being seventy men, upon one stone, but Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.6'>And all the men of Shechem assembled themselves together, and all the house of Millo, and went and made Abimelech king by the oak of the pillar that was in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.7'>And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood on the top of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried out, and said to them, Hearken to me, ye men of Shechem, that God may hearken to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.8'>The trees went forth a time to anoint a king over them. And they said to the olive tree, Reign thou over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.9'>But the olive tree said to them, Should I leave my fatness with which by me they honor God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.10'>And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.11'>But the fig tree said to them, Should I leave my sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.12'>And the trees said to the vine, Come thou, and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.13'>And the vine said to them, Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go to wave to and fro over the trees?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.14'>Then all the trees said to the bramble, Come thou, and reign over us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.15'>And the bramble said to the trees, If in truth ye anoint me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade, and if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the cedars of Lebanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.16'>Now therefore, if ye have dealt truly and uprightly, in that ye have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have done to him according to the deed of his hands</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.17'>(for my father fought for you, and ventured his life, and delivered you out of the hand of Midian,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.18'>and ye have risen up against my father's house this day, and have slain his sons, seventy men, upon one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maid-servant, king over the men of Shechem because he is your brother),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.19'>if ye then have dealt truly and uprightly with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.20'>but if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the men of Shechem, and the house of Millo, and let fire come out from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and devour Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.21'>And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.22'>And Abimelech was ruler over Israel three years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.23'>And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of Shechem, and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.24'>that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and that their blood might be laid upon Abimelech their brother who killed them, and upon the men of Shechem who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.25'>And the men of Shechem set ambushes for him on the tops of the mountains, and they robbed all who came along that way by them, and it was told Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.26'>And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brothers, and went over to Shechem, and the men of Shechem put their trust in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.27'>And they went out into the field, and gathered their vineyards, and trod [the grapes], and held festival, and went into the house of their god, and ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.28'>And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is not he the son of Jerubbaal, and Zebul his officer? Serve ye the men of Hamor the father of Shechem, but why should we serve him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.29'>And would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine army, and come out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.30'>And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.31'>And he sent messengers to Abimelech privately, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem, and, behold, they are fortifying the city against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.32'>Now therefore, up by night, thou and the people who are with thee, and lay in wait in the field.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.33'>And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, thou shall rise early, and rush upon the city, and, behold, when he and the people who are with him come out against thee, then thou may do to them as thou shall find</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.34'>And Abimelech rose up, and all the people who were with him, by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four companies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.35'>And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city. And Abimelech rose up, and the people who were with him, from the ambushment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.36'>And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there comes people down from the tops of the mountains. And Zebul said to him, Thou see the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.37'>And Gaal spoke again and said, See, there comes people down by the middle of the land, and one company comes by the way of the oak of Meonenim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.38'>Then Zebul said to him, Where is now thy mouth, that thou said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? Is not this the people that thou have despised? Go out now, I pray, and fight with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.39'>And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.40'>And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and there fell many wounded, even to the entrance of the gate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.41'>And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his brothers, that they should not dwell in Shechem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.42'>And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out into the field, and they told Abimelech.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.43'>And he took the people, and divided them into three companies, and laid wait in the field. And he looked, and, behold, the people came forth out of the city. And he rose up against them, and smote them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.44'>And Abimelech, and the companies who were with him, rushed forward, and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field, and smote them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.45'>And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. And he took the city, and killed the people that were in it, and he beat down the city, and sowed it with salt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.46'>And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered into the stronghold of the house of El-berith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.47'>And it was told Abimelech that all the men of the tower of Shechem were gathered together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.48'>And Abimelech got up to mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it up, and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the people who w</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.49'>And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and followed Abimelech, and put them to the stronghold, and set the stronghold on fire upon them, so that all the men of the tower of Shechem died also, about a thousand men</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.50'>Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez, and took it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.51'>But there was a strong tower inside the city. And all the men and women fled, and all those of the city, and shut themselves in, and got up to the roof of the tower.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.52'>And Abimelech came to the tower, and fought against it, and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.53'>And a certain woman cast an upper millstone upon Abimelech's head, and broke his skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.54'>Then he called hastily to the young man his armor bearer, and said to him, Draw thy sword, and kill me, that men not say of me, A woman killed him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.55'>And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they departed every man to his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.56'>Thus God requited the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did to his father, in slaying his seventy brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.9.57'>And God requited all the wickedness of the men of Shechem upon their heads. And the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal came upon them.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.10'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.1'>And after Abimelech there arose Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, to save Israel, and he dwelt in Shamir in the hill-country of Ephraim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.2'>And he judged Israel twenty-three years, and died, and was buried in Shamir.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.3'>And after him arose Jair, the Gileadite, and he judged Israel twenty-two years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.4'>And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkey colts, and they had thirty cities, which are called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.5'>And Jair died, and was buried in Kamon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.6'>And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and served the Baalim, and the Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria, and the gods of Sidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of the sons of Ammon, and the god</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.7'>And the anger of LORD was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.8'>And they vexed and oppressed the sons of Israel that year. Eighteen years [they oppressed] all the sons of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.9'>And the sons of Ammon passed over the Jordan to also fight against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was exceedingly distressed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.10'>And the sons of Israel cried to LORD, saying, We have sinned against thee, even because we have forsaken our God, and have served the Baalim.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.11'>And LORD said to the sons of Israel, [Did] not [I save you] from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from the sons of Ammon, and from the Philistines?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.12'>The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, oppressed you. And ye cried to me, and I saved you out of their hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.13'>Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods. Therefore I will save you no more.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.10.14'>Go and cry to the gods which ye have chosen. Let them save you in the time of your distress.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.10.18'>And the people, the rulers of Gilead, said one to another, What man is he who will begin to fight against the sons of Ammon? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Judg.11'>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.1'>Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valor, and he was the son of a harlot, and Gilead begot Jephthah.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.11.15'>And he said to him, Thus says Jephthah: Israel did not take away the land of Moab, nor the land of the sons of Ammon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.16'>but when they came up from Egypt, and Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea, and came to Kadesh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.17'>then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Let me, I pray thee, pass through thy land, but the king of Edom did not hearken. And in like manner he sent to the king of Moab, but he would not. And Israel abode in Kadesh</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.18'>Then they went through the wilderness, and went around the land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side of the land of Moab. And they encamped on the other side of the Arnon, but they did not come within the border</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.19'>And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, the king of Heshbon. And Israel said to him, Let us pass, we pray thee, through thy land to my place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.20'>But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his border, but Sihon gathered all his people together, and encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.21'>And LORD, the God of Israel, delivered Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they smote them. So Israel possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.22'>And they possessed all the border of the Amorites, from the Arnon even to the Jabbok, and from the wilderness even to the Jordan.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.23'>So now LORD, the God of Israel, has dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel, and should thou possess them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.24'>Will thou not possess that which Chemosh thy god gives thee to possess? So whomever LORD our God has dispossessed from before us, them will we possess.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.25'>And now are thou anything better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever fight against them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.26'>While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and its towns, and in Aroer and its towns, and in all the cities that are along by the side of the Arnon, three hundred years, why did ye not recover them within that time?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.27'>I therefore have not sinned against thee, but thou do me wrong to war against me. LORD, the Judge, be judge this day between the sons of Israel and the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.28'>However the king of the sons of Ammon did not hearken to the words of Jephthah which he sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.29'>Then the Spirit of LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed over Gilead and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead, and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over to the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.30'>And Jephthah vowed a vow to LORD, and said, If thou will indeed deliver the sons of Ammon into my hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.31'>then it shall be, that whatever comes forth from the doors of my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the sons of Ammon, it shall be LORD's, and I will offer it up for a burnt-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.32'>So Jephthah passed over to the sons of Ammon to fight against them, and LORD delivered them into his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.33'>And he smote them from Aroer until thou come to Minnith, even twenty cities, and to Abelcheramim, with a very great slaughter. So the sons of Ammon were subdued before the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.34'>And Jephthah came to Mizpah to his house, and, behold, his daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances. And she was his only child. Besides her he had neither son nor daughter.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.11.36'>And she said to him, My father, thou have opened thy mouth to LORD. Do to me according to that which has proceeded out of thy mouth, inasmuch as LORD has taken vengeance for thee on thine enemies, even on the sons of Ammon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.37'>And she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: Let me alone two months, that I may depart and go down upon the mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my companions.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.38'>And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months. And she departed, she and her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the mountains.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.11.39'>And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow which he had vowed, and she knew no man. And it was a custom in Israel,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Judg.13.1'>And the sons of Israel again did that which was evil in the sight of LORD, and LORD delivered them into the hand of the Philistines forty years.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.2'>And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah, and his wife was barren, and did not bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.3'>And the agent of LORD appeared to the woman, and said to her, Behold now, thou are barren, and do not bear, but thou shall conceive, and bear a son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.4'>Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.5'>for, lo, thou shall conceive, and bear a son. And no razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb. And he shall begin to save Israel out of the hand of the Philistines.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.6'>Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God came to me, and his countenance was like the countenance of the agent of God, very awesome. And I did not ask him from where he was, neither did he tell me his name,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.7'>but he said to me, Behold, thou shall conceive, and bear a son. And now drink no wine nor strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.8'>Then Manoah entreated LORD, and said, Oh, LORD, I pray thee, let the man of God whom thou sent come again to us, and teach us what we shall do to the child that shall be born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.9'>And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah, and the agent of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.10'>And the woman made haste, and ran, and told her husband, and said to him, Behold, the man has appeared to me, who came to me the [other] day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.11'>And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the man, and said to him, Are thou the man who spoke to the woman? And he said, I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.12'>And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. What shall be the ordering of the child, and [what] shall we do to him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.13'>And the agent of LORD said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her beware.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.14'>She may not eat of anything that comes of the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.15'>And Manoah said to the agent of LORD, I pray thee, let us detain thee, that we may make ready a kid for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.16'>And the agent of LORD said to Manoah, Though thou detain me, I will not eat of thy bread, and if thou will make ready a burnt-offering, thou must offer it to LORD. For Manoah did not know that he was the agent of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.17'>And Manoah said to the agent of LORD, What is thy name, that, when thy words come to pass, we may do thee honor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.18'>And the agent of LORD said to him, Why do thou ask after my name, seeing it is wonderful?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.19'>So Manoah took the kid with the meal-offering, and offered it upon the rock to LORD. And [the heavenly agent] did wondrously, and Manoah and his wife looked on,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.20'>for it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from off the altar, that the agent of LORD ascended in the flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on, and they fell on their faces to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.21'>But the agent of LORD appeared no more to Manoah or to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the agent of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.22'>And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, because we have seen God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.23'>But his wife said to him, If LORD were pleased to kill us, he would not have received a burnt-offering and a meal-offering at our hand, neither would he have shown us all these things, nor would at this time have told such things a</verse>
        <verse osisID='Judg.13.24'>And the woman bore a son, and called his name Samson. And the child grew, and LORD blessed him.</verse>
