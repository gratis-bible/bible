      <chapter osisID='Exod.1'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.1'>Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came into Egypt (every man and his household who came with Jacob):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.2'>Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.3'>Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.4'>Dan and Naphtali, Gad and Asher.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.5'>And all the souls who came out of the loins of Jacob were seventy-five (LXX/NT) souls. And Joseph was in Egypt already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.6'>And Joseph died, and all his brothers, and all that generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.7'>And the sons of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and grew exceedingly mighty, and the land was filled with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.8'>Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.9'>And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are more and mightier than we.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.10'>Come, let us deal craftily with them, lest they multiply, and it come to pass, that, when war happens, they also join themselves to our enemies, and fight against us, and get them up out of the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.11'>Therefore they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom and Rameses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.12'>But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and the more they spread out. And they were grieved because of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.13'>And the Egyptians made the sons of Israel to serve with rigor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.14'>And they made their lives bitter with hard service, in mortar and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field, all their service, with which they made them serve with rigor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.15'>And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.16'>And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the birth-stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill him, but if it be a daughter, then she shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.17'>But the midwives feared God, and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male children alive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.18'>And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male children alive?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.19'>And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women, for they are lively, and are delivered before the midwife comes to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.20'>And God dealt well with the midwives. And the people multiplied, and grew very mighty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.21'>And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them households.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.1.22'>And Pharaoh ordered all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.2'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.1'>And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter of Levi.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.2'>And the woman conceived, and bore a son. And when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.3'>And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch. And she put the child in it, and laid it in the reeds by the river's edge.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.4'>And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.5'>And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the river, and her maidens walked along by the riverside. And she saw the ark among the reeds, and sent her handmaid to fetch it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.6'>And she opened it, and saw the child, and, behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.7'>Then his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and call a nurse for thee from the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.8'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maiden went and called the child's mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.9'>And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child, and nursed it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.10'>And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses, and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.11'>And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown up, that he went out to his brothers, and looked on their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brothers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.12'>And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.13'>And he went out the second day, and, behold, two men of the Hebrews were striving together. And he said to him who did the wrong, Why do thou smite thy neighbor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.14'>And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? Do thou think to kill me, as thou killed the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely the thing is known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.15'>Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to kill Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.16'>Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.17'>And the shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.18'>And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that ye have come so soon today?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.19'>And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of the shepherds, and moreover he drew water for us, and watered the flock.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.20'>And he said to his daughters, And where is he? Why is it that ye have left the man? Call him, that he may eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.21'>And Moses was content to dwell with the man, and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.22'>And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom, for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.23'>And it came to pass in the course of those many days, that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel sighed because of the bondage, and they cried, and their cry came up to God because of the bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.24'>And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.2.25'>And God saw the sons of Israel, and God took knowledge [of them].</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.3'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.1'>Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock to the back of the wilderness, and came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.2'>And the agent of LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush. And he looked, and, behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.3'>And Moses said, I will turn aside now, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.4'>And when LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.5'>And he said, Do not draw near here. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place on which thou stand is holy ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.6'>Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.7'>And LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters, for I know their sorrows.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.8'>And I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land to a good and large land, to a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the A</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.9'>And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel have come to me. Moreover I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.10'>Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou may bring forth my people the sons of Israel out of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.11'>And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the sons of Israel out of Egypt?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.12'>And he said, I will certainly be with thee. And this shall be the sign to thee, that I have sent thee: When thou have brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.13'>And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the sons of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers has sent me to you, and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say to them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.14'>And God said to Moses, I AM WHO I AM. And he said, Thus shall thou say to the sons of Israel, I AM has sent me to you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.15'>And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shall thou say to the sons of Israel, LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memor</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.16'>Go, and gather the elders of Israel together, and say to them, LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, has appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and [seen] that which is done to you i</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.17'>And I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.18'>And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shall come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. And now let us go, we pray thee, three days' jou</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.19'>And I know that the king of Egypt will not give you leave to go, no, not by a mighty hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.20'>And I will put forth my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst of it, and after that he will let you go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.21'>And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. And it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.3.22'>But every woman shall ask of her neighbor, and of her who sojourns in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. And ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters, and ye shall despoil the Egyptians.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.4'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.1'>And Moses answered and said, But, behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice, for they will say, LORD has not appeared to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.2'>And LORD said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.3'>And he said, Cast in on the ground. And he cast it on the ground. And it became a serpent, and Moses fled from before it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.4'>And LORD said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail (and he put forth his hand, and laid hold of it, and it became a rod in his hand),</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.5'>that they may believe that LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has appeared to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.6'>And LORD said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom. And when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous, as snow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.7'>And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. (And he put his hand into his bosom again, and when he took it out of his bosom, behold, it was turned again as his [other] flesh.)</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.8'>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, nor hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.9'>And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe even these two signs, nor hearken to thy voice, that thou shall take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land. And the water which thou take out of the river shall</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.10'>And Moses said to LORD, Oh, LORD, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou have spoken to thy servant, for I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.11'>And LORD said to him, Who has made man's mouth? Or who makes [a man] dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? Is it not I, LORD?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.12'>Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shall speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.13'>And he said, Oh, LORD, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou will send.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.14'>And the anger of LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is there not Aaron thy brother the Levite? I know that he can speak well. And also, behold, he comes forth to meet thee, and when he sees thee, he will be glad in his he</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.15'>And thou shall speak to him, and put the words in his mouth. And I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.16'>and he shall be thy spokesman to the people. And it shall come to pass, that he shall be to thee a mouth, and thou shall be to him as God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.17'>And thou shall take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shall do the signs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.18'>And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brothers who are in Egypt, and see whether they be yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.19'>And LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt, for all the men are dead who sought thy life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.20'>And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them upon a donkey, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.21'>And LORD said to Moses, When thou go back into Egypt, see that thou do before Pharaoh all the wonders which I have put in thy hand, but I will harden his heart and he will not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.22'>And thou shall say to Pharaoh, Thus says LORD, Israel is my son, my first-born,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.23'>and I have said to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me, and thou have refused to let him go. Behold, I will slay thy son, thy first-born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.24'>And it came to pass on the way at the lodging-place, that LORD met him, and sought to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.25'>Then Zipporah took a flint, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet. And she said, Surely a bridegroom of blood thou are to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.26'>So he let him alone. Then she said, A bridegroom of blood [thou are], because of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.27'>And LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him on the mountain of God, and kissed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.28'>And Moses told Aaron all the words of LORD with which he had sent him, and all the signs with which he had ordered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.29'>And Moses and Aaron went and gathered together all the elders of the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.30'>And Aaron spoke all the words which LORD had spoken to Moses, and did the signs in the sight of the people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.4.31'>And the people believed. And when they heard that LORD had visited the sons of Israel, and that he had seen their affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Exod.5'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.1'>And afterward Moses and Aaron came, and said to Pharaoh, Thus says LORD, the God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.2'>And Pharaoh said, Who is LORD, that I should hearken to his voice to let Israel go? I do not know LORD, and moreover I will not let Israel go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.3'>And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to LORD our God, lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.4'>And the king of Egypt said to them, Therefore do ye, Moses and Aaron, loose the people from their works? Get you to your burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.5'>And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land are now many, and ye make them rest from their burdens.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.6'>And the same day Pharaoh commanded the taskmasters of the people, and their officers, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.7'>Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick as formerly. Let them go and gather straw for themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.8'>And the number of the bricks, which they made formerly, ye shall lay upon them. Ye shall not diminish any of it. For they are idle, therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.9'>Let heavier work be laid upon the men, that they may labor in it, and let them not regard lying words.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.10'>And the taskmasters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh, I will not give you straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.11'>Go yourselves, get you straw where ye can find it, for none of your work shall be diminished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.12'>So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.13'>And the taskmasters were urgent saying, Fulfill your works, [your] daily tasks, as when there was straw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.14'>And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task both yesterday and today, in making brick as formerly?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.15'>Then the officers of the sons of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why do thou deal thus with thy servants?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.16'>There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick. And, behold, thy servants are beaten, but the fault it in thine own people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.17'>But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle. Therefore ye say, Let us go and sacrifice to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.18'>Go therefore now, and work, for there shall no straw be given you, yet ye shall deliver the number of bricks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.19'>And the officers of the sons of Israel saw that they were in affliction, when it was said, Ye shall not diminish anything from your bricks, [your] daily tasks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.20'>And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.21'>and they said to them, LORD look upon you, and judge, because ye have made our fragrance to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hand to slay us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.22'>And Moses returned to LORD, and said, LORD, why have thou dealt ill with this people? Why is it that thou have sent me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.5.23'>For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he has dealt ill with this people, neither have thou delivered thy people at all.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.6.1'>And LORD said to Moses, Now thou shall see what I will do to Pharaoh. For by a strong hand he shall let them go, and by a strong hand he shall drive them out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.2'>And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.3'>And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, as God Almighty, but I was not known to them by my name LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.4'>And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojourning, in which they sojourned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.5'>And moreover I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage, and I have remembered my covenant.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.6'>Therefore say to the sons of Israel, I am LORD. And I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rid you out of their bondage, and I will redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.7'>And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God, and ye shall know that I am LORD your God, who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.8'>And I will bring you in to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, and I will give it to you for a heritage. I am LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.6.9'>And Moses spoke so to the sons of Israel, but they did not hearken to Moses for anguish of spirit, and for cruel bondage.</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Exod.7'>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.1'>And LORD said to Moses, See, I have made thee as God to Pharaoh, and Aaron thy brother shall be thy prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.2'>Thou shall speak all that I command thee, and Aaron thy brother shall speak to Pharaoh, that he let the sons of Israel go out of his land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.3'>And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.4'>But Pharaoh will not hearken to you. And I will lay my hand upon Egypt, and bring forth my armies, my people the sons of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great judgments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.5'>And the Egyptians shall know that I am LORD, when I stretch forth my hand upon Egypt, and bring out the sons of Israel from among them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.6'>And Moses and Aaron did so, as LORD commanded them, so they did.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.7'>And Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron eighty-three years old, when they spoke to Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.8'>And LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.9'>When Pharaoh shall speak to you, saying, Show a wonder for you, then thou shall say to Aaron, Take thy rod, and cast it down before Pharaoh, that it become a serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.10'>And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh. And they did so, as LORD had commanded, and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh and before his servants, and it became a serpent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.11'>Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and the sorcerers. And they also, the magicians of Egypt, did in like manner with their enchantments.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.12'>For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents, but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.13'>And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as LORD had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.14'>And LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is stubborn; he refuses to let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.15'>Get thee to Pharaoh in the morning, lo, he goes out to the water, and thou shall stand by the river's edge to meet him, and the rod which was turned to a serpent thou shall take in thy hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.16'>And thou shall say to him, LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to thee, saying, Let my people go, that they may serve me in the wilderness. And, behold, until now thou have not hearkened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.17'>Thus says LORD, In this thou shall know that I am LORD. Behold, I will smite with the rod that is in my hand upon the waters which are in the river, and they shall be turned to blood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.18'>And the fish that are in the river shall die, and the river shall become foul, and the Egyptians shall loathe to drink water from the river.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.7.20'>And Moses and Aaron did so, as LORD commanded. And he lifted up the rod, and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants, and all the waters that were in the river were turned</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.21'>And the fish that were in the river died, and the river became foul, and the Egyptians could not drink water from the river. And the blood was throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.22'>And the magicians of Egypt did in like manner with their enchantments. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as LORD had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.23'>And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he lay even this to heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.24'>And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water to drink, for they could not drink of the water of the river.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.7.25'>And seven days were fulfilled, after LORD had smitten the river.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.8.1'>And LORD spoke to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus says LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.2'>And if thou refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.3'>And the river shall swarm with frogs, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bedchamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-trough</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.8.5'>And LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the rivers, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause frogs to come up upon the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.6'>And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.7'>And the magicians did in like manner with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.8'>Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat LORD, that he take away the frogs from me, and from my people, and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.9'>And Moses said to Pharaoh, Have this honor over me: When shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, that the frogs be destroyed from thee and thy houses, and remain in the river only?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.10'>And he said, Tomorrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word, that thou may know that there is none like LORD our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.11'>And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people, they shall remain in the river only.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.12'>And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh. And Moses cried to LORD concerning the frogs which he had brought upon Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.13'>And LORD did according to the word of Moses. And the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the fields.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.14'>And they gathered them together in heaps, and the land stank.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.15'>But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart, and did not hearken to them, as LORD had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.16'>And LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the earth, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.17'>And they did so. And Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth. And there were lice upon man, and upon beast; all the dust of the earth became lice throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.18'>And the magicians did so with their enchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not. And there were lice upon man, and upon beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.19'>Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God. And Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he did not hearken to them, as LORD had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.20'>And LORD said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh. Lo, he comes forth to the water. And say to him, Thus says LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.21'>Else, if thou will not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon they servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses. And the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also th</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.8.23'>And I will put a division between my people and thy people. This sign shall be by tomorrow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.24'>And LORD did so, and there came grievous swarms of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses. And in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted because of the swarms of flies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.25'>And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.26'>And Moses said, It is not right to do so, for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to LORD our God. Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.8.27'>We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to LORD our God, as he shall command us.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.1'>Then LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus says LORD, the God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.2'>For if thou refuse to let them go, and will still hold them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.3'>behold, the hand of LORD is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the donkeys, upon the camels, upon the herds, and upon the flocks--a very grievous pestilence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.4'>And LORD shall make a distinction between the cattle of Israel and the cattle of Egypt, and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the sons of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.5'>And LORD appointed a set time, saying, Tomorrow LORD shall do this thing in the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.6'>And LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died, but of the cattle of the sons of Israel not one died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.7'>And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, there was not so much as one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, and he did not let the people go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.8'>And LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it toward heaven in the sight of Pharaoh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.9'>And it shall become small dust over all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with sores upon man and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.10'>And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh, and Moses sprinkled it up toward heaven, and it became a boil breaking forth with sores upon man and upon beast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.11'>And the magicians could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.12'>And LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not hearken to them, as LORD had spoken to Moses.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.16'>But indeed for this cause I have raised thee up, to display in thee my power, and that my name may be proclaimed in all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.17'>As yet thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou will not let them go?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.18'>Behold, tomorrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as has not been in Egypt since the day it was founded even until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.19'>Now therefore send, hasten in thy cattle and all that thou have in the field, [for] every man and beast that shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.20'>He who feared the word of LORD among the servants of Pharaoh made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.21'>And he who did not regard the word of LORD left his servants and his cattle in the field.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.23'>And Moses stretched forth his rod toward heaven, and LORD sent thunder and hail, and fire ran down to the earth, and LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.24'>So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.25'>And throughout all the land of Egypt the hail smote all that was in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Exod.9.27'>And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time. LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.28'>Entreat LORD, for there has been enough of [these] mighty thunderings and hail, and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Exod.9.29'>And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to LORD. The thunders shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail, that thou may know that the earth is LORD's.</verse>
