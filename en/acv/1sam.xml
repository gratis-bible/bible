      <chapter osisID='1Sam.1'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.1'>Now there was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim of the hill-country of Ephraim. And his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, and Ephraimite.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.2'>And he had two wives: the name of the one was Hannah, and the name of other Peninnah. And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.3'>And this man went up out of his city from year to year to worship and to sacrifice to LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, priests to LORD, were there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.4'>And when the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he gave to Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters, portions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.5'>but to Hannah he gave a double portion, for he loved Hannah, but LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.6'>And her rival provoked her greatly, to make her fret, because LORD had shut up her womb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.7'>And [as] he did so year by year when she went up to the house of LORD, so she provoked her. Therefore she wept, and did not eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.8'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Hannah, why do thou weep? And why do thou not eat? And why is thy heart grieved? Am not I better to thee than ten sons?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.9'>So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after they had drunk. Now Eli the priest was sitting upon his seat by the door-post of the temple of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.10'>And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed to LORD, and wept much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.11'>And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou will indeed look on the affliction of thy handmaid, and remember me, and not forget thy handmaid, but will give to thy handmaid a man-child, then I will give him to LORD all t</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.12'>And it came to pass, as she continued praying before LORD, that Eli noticed her mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.13'>Now Hannah, she spoke in her heart; only her lips moved, but her voice was not heard. Therefore Eli thought she had been drunken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.14'>And Eli said to her, How long will thou be drunken? Put away thy wine from thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.15'>And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a sorrowful spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink, but I poured out my soul before LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.16'>Count not thy handmaid for an iniquitous woman, for out of the abundance of my complaint and my provocation have I spoken until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.17'>Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace, and the God of Israel grant thy petition that thou have asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.18'>And she said, Let thy handmaid find favor in thy sight. So the woman went her way, and ate, and her countenance was no more [sad].</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.19'>And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah. And Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and LORD remembered her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.20'>And it came to pass, when the time came about, that Hannah conceived, and bore a son. And she called his name Samuel, [saying], Because I have asked him of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.21'>And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer to LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.22'>But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, [Not] until the child be weaned, and then I will bring him, that he may appear before LORD, and abide there forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.23'>And Elkanah her husband said to her, Do what seems good to thee. Remain until thou have weaned him, only LORD establish his word. So the woman remained and gave her son suck, until she weaned him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.24'>And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with three bullocks, and one ephah of meal, and a bottle of wine, and brought him to the house of LORD in Shiloh, and the child was young.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.25'>And they killed the bullock, and brought the child to Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.26'>And she said, Oh, my lord, as thy soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood by thee here, praying to LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.27'>I prayed for this child, and LORD has given me my petition which I asked of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.1.28'>Therefore also I have granted him to LORD; as long as he lives he is granted to LORD. And he worshipped LORD there.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.2'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.1'>And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart exults in LORD. My horn is exalted in LORD. My mouth is enlarged over my enemies because I rejoice in thy salvation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.2'>There is none holy as LORD, for there is none besides thee, neither is there any rock like our God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.3'>Talk no more so very proudly. Let not arrogancy come out of your mouth, for LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.4'>The bows of the mighty men are broken, and those who stumbled are girded with strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.5'>Those who were full have hired out themselves for bread, and those who were hungry have ceased [to hunger]. Yea, the barren has borne seven, and she who has many sons languishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.6'>LORD kills, and makes alive. He brings down to Sheol, and brings up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.7'>LORD makes poor, and makes rich. He brings low, he also lifts up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.8'>He raises up the poor out of the dust, he lifts up the needy from the dunghill, to make them sit with rulers, and inherit the throne of glory. For the pillars of the earth are LORD's, and he has set the world upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.9'>He will keep the feet of his holy ones, but the wicked shall be put to silence in darkness, for by strength no man shall prevail.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.10'>Those who strive with LORD shall be broken to pieces. He will thunder against them in heaven. LORD will judge the ends of the earth, and he will give strength to his king, and exalt the horn of his anointed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.11'>And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house, and the child ministered to LORD before Eli the priest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.12'>Now the sons of Eli were base men; they knew not LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.13'>And the custom of the priests with the people was, that, when any man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the flesh was boiling, with a flesh-hook of three teeth in his hand,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.14'>and he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot. All that the flesh-hook brought up the priest took with it. So they did in Shiloh to all the Israelites who came there.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.15'>And before they burned the fat, the priest's servant came, and said to the man who sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the priest, for he will not have boiled flesh from thee, but raw.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.16'>And if the man said to him, They will surely burn the fat first, and then take as much as thy soul desires, then he would say, No, but thou shall give it to me now, and if not, I will take it by force.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.17'>And the sin of the young men was very great before LORD, for the men despised the offering of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.18'>But Samuel ministered before LORD, being a child, girded with a linen ephod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.19'>Moreover his mother made him a little robe, and brought it to him from year to year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.20'>And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, LORD give thee seed by this woman for the petition which was asked of LORD. And they went to their own home.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.21'>And LORD visited Hannah, and she conceived, and bore three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.22'>Now Eli was very old. And he heard all that his sons did to all Israel, and how that they lay with the women who assembled at the door of the tent of meeting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.23'>And he said to them, Why do ye such things? For I hear of your evil dealings from all this people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.24'>No, my sons, for it is no good report that I hear. Ye make LORD's people to transgress.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.25'>If one man sins against another, God shall judge him, but if a man sins against LORD, who shall entreat for him? Notwithstanding, they did not hearken to the voice of their father, because LORD intended to kill them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.26'>And the child Samuel grew on, and increased in favor both with LORD, and also with men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.27'>And there came a man of God to Eli, and said to him, Thus says LORD, Did I reveal myself to the house of thy father when they were in Egypt [in bondage] to Pharaoh's house?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.28'>And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to go up to my altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before me? And did I give to the house of thy father all the offerings of the sons of Israel made by fire</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.29'>Why do ye kick at my sacrifice and at my offering, which I have commanded in [my] habitation, and honor thy sons above me, to make yourselves fat with the chief of all the offerings of Israel my people?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.30'>Therefore LORD, the God of Israel, says, I said indeed that thy house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me forever, but now LORD says, Be it far from me, for those who honor me I will honor, and those who despise me</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.31'>Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man in thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.32'>And thou shall see an enemy [in my] habitation, in all that I shall give Israel, and there shall not be an old man in thy house forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.33'>And the man of thine, [whom] I shall not cut off from my altar, [shall be] to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thy heart. And all the increase of thy house shall die in the flower of their age.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.34'>And this shall be the sign to thee, that shall come upon thy two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas: In one day they shall die, both of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.35'>And I will raise up for me a faithful priest who shall do according to that which is in my heart and in my mind. And I will build for him a sure house, and he shall walk before my anointed forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.2.36'>And it shall come to pass, that everyone who is left in thy house shall come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee, into one of the priests' offices that I may eat a morse</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.3'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.1'>And the child Samuel served LORD before Eli. And the word of LORD was precious in those days; there was no frequent vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.2'>And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place (now his eyes had begun to grow dim so that he could not see),</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.3'>and the lamp of God was not yet gone out, and Samuel was laid down in the temple of LORD where the ark of God was,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.4'>that LORD called Samuel. And he said, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.5'>And he ran to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And he said, I did not call. Lay down again. And he went and lay down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.6'>And LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And he answered, I did not call, my son. Lay down again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.7'>Now Samuel did not yet know LORD, neither was the word of LORD yet revealed to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.8'>And LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose and went to Eli, and said, Here I am, for thou called me. And Eli perceived that LORD had called the child.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.9'>Therefore Eli said to Samuel, Go, lay down, and it shall be, if he calls thee, that thou shall say, Speak, LORD, for thy servant hears. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.10'>And LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times, Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel said, Speak, for thy servant hears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.11'>And LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in Israel at which both the ears of everyone who hears it shall tingle.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.12'>In that day I will perform against Eli all that I have spoken concerning his house, from the beginning even to the end.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.13'>For I have told him that I will judge his house forever, for the iniquity which he knew, because his sons brought a curse upon themselves, and he did not restrain them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.14'>And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the iniquity of Eli's house shall not be expiated with sacrifice nor offering forever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.15'>And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the house of LORD. And Samuel was afraid to show Eli the vision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.16'>Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he said, Here I am.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.17'>And he said, What is the thing that [LORD] has spoken to thee? I pray thee, hide it not from me. God do so to thee, and more also, if thou hide anything from me of all the things that he spoke to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.18'>And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And he said, It is LORD. Let him do what seems him good.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.19'>And Samuel grew, and LORD was with him, and let none of his words fall to the ground.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.20'>And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was established to be a prophet of LORD.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.3.21'>And LORD appeared again in Shiloh, for LORD revealed himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of LORD.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.4'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.1'>And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out against the Philistines to battle, and encamped beside Ebenezer, and the Philistines encamped in Aphek.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.2'>And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel. And when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the Philistines; and they killed of the army in the field about four thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.3'>And when the people came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Why has LORD smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of LORD out of Shiloh to us, that it may come among us, and save us out o</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.4'>So the people sent to Shiloh, and they brought from there the ark of the covenant of LORD of hosts, who sits [above] the cherubim. And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant of God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.5'>And when the ark of the covenant of LORD came into the camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth rang again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.6'>And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, What is the meaning of the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of LORD came into the camp.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.7'>And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God has come into the camp. And they said, Woe to us! For there has not been such a thing heretofore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.8'>Woe to us! Who shall deliver us out of the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods that smote the Egyptians with all manner of plagues in the wilderness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.9'>Be strong, and strengthen yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that ye be not servants to the Hebrews, as they have been to you. Conduct yourselves like men, and fight.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.10'>And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man to his tent. And there was a very great slaughter, for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.11'>And the ark of God was taken, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.12'>And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to Shiloh the same day, with his clothes torn, and with dirt upon his head.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.13'>And when he came, lo, Eli was sitting upon his seat by the wayside watching, for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.14'>And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What does the noise of this tumult mean? And the man hastened, and came and told Eli.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.15'>Now Eli was ninety-eight years old, and his eyes were dim so that he could not see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.16'>And the man said to Eli, I am he who came out of the army, and I fled today out of the army. And he said, How did the matter go, my son?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.17'>And he who brought the news answered and said, Israel has fled before the Philistines, and there has been also a great slaughter among the people. And thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God is taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.18'>And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God, that [Eli] fell from off his seat backward by the side of the gate. And his neck broke, and he died, for he was an old man, and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty year</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.19'>And his daughter-in-law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near to be delivered. And when she heard the news that the ark of God was taken, and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she bowed herself and brought forth, fo</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.20'>And about the time of her death the women who stood by her said to her, Fear not, for thou have brought forth a son. But she did not answer, neither did she regard it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.21'>And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory has departed from Israel, because the ark of God was taken, and because of her father-in-law and her husband.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.4.22'>And she said, The glory has departed from Israel, for the ark of God is taken.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='1Sam.5'>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.1'>Now the Philistines had taken the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.2'>And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it into the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.3'>And when those of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.4'>And when they arose early on the morning of the morrow, behold, Dagon was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of LORD, and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands [lay] cut off upon the threshold. Only [the</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.5'>Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any who come into Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod, to this day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.6'>But the hand of LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he destroyed them, and smote them with tumors, even Ashdod and the borders of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.7'>And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us, for his hand is hard upon us, and upon Dagon our god.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.8'>They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the Philistines to them, and said, What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the God of Israel be carried about to Gath. And they carried</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.9'>And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand of LORD was against the city with a very great discomfiture. And he smote the men of the city, both small and great, and tumors broke out upon them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.5.10'>So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God of Israel to us, to kill us and our people.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.3'>And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.4'>And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten the garrison of the Philistines, and also that Israel was had in abomination with the Philistines. And the people were gathered together after Saul to Gilgal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.5'>And the Philistines assembled themselves together to fight with Israel: thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen, and people as the sand which is on the sea-shore in multitude. And they came up, and encamped in Michmash,</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.6'>When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait (for the people were distressed), then the people hide themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in coverts, and in pits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.7'>Now some of the Hebrews had gone over the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead, but as for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.8'>And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that Samuel [had appointed], but Samuel did not come to Gilgal, and the people were scattered from him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.12'>therefore I said, Now the Philistines will come down upon me to Gilgal, and I have not entreated the favor of LORD. I forced myself therefore, and offered the burnt-offering.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.13.13'>And Samuel said to Saul, Thou have done foolishly. Thou have not kept the commandment of LORD thy God, which he commanded thee. For now LORD would have established thy kingdom upon Israel forever,</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.4'>And between the passes by which Jonathan sought to go over to the Philistines' garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side, and a rocky crag on the other side. And the name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.6'>And Jonathan said to the young man who bore his armor, Come, and let us go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised. It may be that LORD will work for us, for there is no limitation to LORD to save by many or by few.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.13'>And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and his armor bearer after him. And they fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer killed them after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.14'>And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armor bearer made, was about twenty men, within as it were half a furrow's length in an acre of land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.14.15'>And there was a trembling in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. The garrison, and the spoilers, they also trembled. And the earth quaked, so there was an exceedingly great trembling.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.17'>And Jonathan caused David to swear again, for the love that he had to him. For he loved him as he loved his own soul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.18'>Then Jonathan said to him, Tomorrow is the new moon, and thou will be missed because thy seat will be empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.19'>And when thou have stayed three days, thou shall go down quickly, and come to the place where thou hid thyself when the business was in hand, and shall remain by the stone Ezel.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.30'>Then Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan, and he said to him, Thou son of a perverse rebellious woman, do I not know that thou have chosen the son of Jesse to thine own shame, and to the shame of thy mother's nakedness?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.31'>For as long as the son of Jesse lives upon the ground, thou shall not be established, nor thy kingdom. Therefore now send and fetch him to me, for he shall surely die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.32'>And Jonathan answered Saul his father, and said to him, Why should he be put to death? What has he done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.33'>And Saul cast his spear at him to smite him. By this Jonathan knew that it was determined by his father to put David to death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.34'>So Jonathan arose from the table in fierce anger, and ate no food the second day of the month, for he was grieved for David because his father had done him shame.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.35'>And it came to pass in the morning, that Jonathan went out into the field at the time appointed with David, and a little lad with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.36'>And he said to his lad, Run, now find the arrows which I shoot. And as the lad ran, he shot an arrow beyond him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='1Sam.20.41'>And as soon as the lad was gone, David arose out of [a place] toward the South, and fell on his face to the ground, and bowed himself three times. And they kissed each other, and wept one with another until David surpassed [him].</verse>
