      <chapter osisID='Mark.1'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.1'>THE beginning of the Gospel of Jeshu Meshicha, the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.2'>As it is written in Eshaia the prophet: Behold, I send my angel before thy face, Who shall make straight thy way.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.3'>The voice which crieth in the desert, Prepare the way of the Lord, Make level his paths.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.4'>Juchanon was in the desert, baptizing, and proclaiming the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.5'>And all the region of Jehud and all the sons of Urishlem went out to him; and he baptized them in Jurdan the river, while they were confessing their sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.6'>But Juchanon himself was clothed with a garment of the hair of camels, and engirded with a belt of leather upon his loins; and his food was locusts and wilderness honey.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.7'>And he proclaimed and said, Behold, (One) cometh after me, who is mightier than I; he, the latchet of whose shoes I am not worthy to bow myself to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.8'>I have baptized you with waters; but he shall baptize you with the Spirit of Holiness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.9'>And it was in those days that Jeshu came from Natsrath of Galila, and was baptized in Jurdan by Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.10'>And as soon as he had ascended from the waters, he saw the heavens part asunder, and the Spirit, as a dove, descend upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.11'>And the voice was from the heavens, Thou art my Son, the Beloved: in thee I have delighted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.12'>And immediately the Spirit led him forth into the desert.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.13'>And he was there in the desert forty days, being tempted by Satana: and he was with the wild beasts; and the angels ministered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.14'>BUT after Juchanon was delivered up, Jeshu came to Galila, and proclaimed the annunciation of the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.15'>And he said, The time is complete; the kingdom of Aloha cometh: repent, and believe the gospel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.16'>And while he walked about the sea of Galila, he saw Shemun and Andreas his brother, who were casting nets into the sea: for they were fishers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.17'>And Jeshu said to them, Come after me, and I will make you fishers of the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.18'>And at once they forsook their nets, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.19'>And when he had passed on a little, he saw Jakub bar Zabdai and Juchanon his brother; and they also were in a vessel, preparing their nets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.20'>And he called them; and forthwith they left Zabdai their father with the hirelings, and went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.21'>And when they were come to Kapher-nachum, he forthwith taught on the sabbaths in their assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.22'>And they wondered at his doctrine; for he taught them as having power, and not as their Sophree.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.23'>And there was in their assembly a man who had an unclean spirit: and he cried</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.24'>and said, What to us and to thee, Jeshu Natsroya? Art thou come to destroy us? I know thee who thou art, the Holy One of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.25'>And Jeshu restrained him, and said, Close thy mouth, and come forth from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.26'>And the impure spirit threw him down, and cried with a high voice, and went forth from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.27'>And all wondered, and questioned one with another, Who is this? and what is this new doctrine? because with authority he commandeth the impure spirits, and they obey him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.28'>And his fame soon went out through all the region of Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.29'>And he proceeded from the assembly, and came to the house of Shemun and Andreas with Jacub and Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.30'>And the mother-in-law of Shemun was lying in a fever; and they told him concerning her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.31'>And he approached, took her by her hand; and she arose, and at once the fever left her, and she served them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.32'>Then in the evening at sun-setting they brought to him all those who were grievously affected and demoniacs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.33'>And the whole city was assembled at the gate:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.34'>and he healed multitudes who were grievously affected with various diseases, and cast out many demons, and would not permit the demons to speak; for they knew him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.35'>AND in the morning he arose long before (day), and went into a solitude, and there prayed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.36'>And Shemun and (they) who (were) with him sought for him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.37'>and when they had found him, they said to him, All men are seeking thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.38'>He said to them, Proceed you to the neighbouring towns and cities; for there also I will preach, because for this am I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.39'>And he preached in all their assemblies in all Galila, and cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.40'>And a leper came to him, and fell at his feet, and besought him, and said to him, If thou wilt, thou canst cleanse me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.41'>And Jeshu had compassion on him, and stretched forth his hand, touched him, and said, I will, be clean.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.42'>And in that very hour his leprosy went from him, and he was cleansed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.43'>And he restrained him, and led him forth,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.44'>and said to him, See lest thou tell any one; but go, show thyself to the priests, and offer the oblation for thy purification as Musha commanded for their testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.1.45'>But he, when he was gone forth, began to announce it much, and so divulged the matter as that Jeshu could not go openly in the city, but was without in a solitary part: and they came to him from every place.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.2'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.1'>AND Jeshu entered again into Kapher-nachum for some days. And when they had heard that he was in the house,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.2'>many were gathered together, so that it could not contain them, nor yet (the space) before the gate; and he spake with them the word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.3'>And they came to him, and brought him a paralytic borne between four.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.4'>And when they could not approach him for the crowd, they ascended to the roof, and took the covering from the place where Jeshu was, and let down the couch on which the paralytic lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.5'>When Jeshu saw their faith, he said to the paralytic himself, My son, forgiven to thee are thy sins.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.6'>But some of the Sophree and Pharishee were there, who sat and reasoned in their heart,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.7'>Who is this uttering blasphemy? Who can forgive sins but One, Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.8'>But Jeshu knew in his spirit that they so reasoned within themselves, and said to them, Why reason you these things in your heart?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.9'>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, Forgiven are thy sins, or to say, Arise, lift up thy couch, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.10'>But, that you may know that the Son of man hath power on earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.11'>To thee I say, Arise, take up thy couch, and go to thy house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.12'>And he arose at once, and took up his couch, and went forth before them all; so that all wondered, and glorified Aloha, saying, Never saw we thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.13'>AND he went forth again to the sea; and the whole multitude came to him, and he taught them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.14'>And when he had passed, he saw Levi bar Chalphai sitting among the publicans: and he said to him, Come after me; and arising, he went after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.15'>And while he reclined in the house, many publicans and sinners reclined with Jeshu and with his disciples; for they were many, and they followed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.16'>And the Sophree and Pharishee, when they saw him eat with publicans and with sinners, said to his disciples, Why with publicans and with sinners doth he eat and drink?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.17'>But when Jeshu heard, he said to them, The healthy have no need of the physician, but they who are sorely affected: I have not come to call the righteous but the sinners.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.18'>Now the disciples of Juchanon and of the Pharishee fasted. And they came and said to him, (While) the disciples of Juchanon and of the Pharishee fast, why do not thy disciples fast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.19'>Jeshu said to them, Can the sons of the marriage-chamber fast, while the bridegroom is with them? No;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.20'>but the days shall come when the bridegroom shall be taken up from them: then shall they fast in those days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.21'>No man inserteth a new piece, and seweth it upon an old vestment; lest that new should take away its fulness from the old, and make the rent the greater.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.22'>And no man putteth new wine into old bottles; lest the wine rend the bottles, and the bottles perish, and the wine be spilled: but they put new vine into new bottles.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.23'>AND it was that, as Jeshu went among the grain, his disciples walked and plucked the ears.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.24'>And the Pharishee said to him, See how on the shabath they do what is not lawful.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.25'>Jeshu saith to them, Have you never read what David did, when he needed and was hungry, he, and they (who were) with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.26'>how he entered the house of Aloha, when Abiathar was high priest, and did eat the bread of the table of the Lord, that which it is not lawful except for the priests to eat, and gave also to those who were with him?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.27'>And he said to them, that the shabath on account of the Son of man was made, and not the Son of man on account of the shabath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.2.28'>The Son of man, therefore, is the Lord also of the shabath.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.3'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.1'>And Jeshu again entered the congregation: and a certain man was there whose hand was withered;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.2'>and they watched him whether he would cure him on the shabath, that they might accuse him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.3'>And he said to him, the man with the withered hand, Stand up in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.4'>He said also to them, Is it lawful on the shabath to do good, or (that) which (is) evil? to save life, or to destroy it? But they were silent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.5'>And he beheld them with indignation, while it grieved him on account of the hardness of their hearts. And he said to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he stretched (it); and his hand straightened.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.6'>And the Pharishee went out immediately, and took counsel against him, how they might destroy him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.7'>And Jeshu with his disciples went towards the sea: and many people joined him from Galila, and from Jehud,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.8'>and from Urishlem, and from Edum, and from beyond Jurdan, and from Tsur, and from Tsaidon; great multitudes, who, having heard all that he had done, came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.9'>And he spoke to his disciples to bring a vessel for him, that the crowds might not oppress him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.10'>for he had healed multitudes, until they were falling upon him to touch him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.11'>And they who were troubled with impure spirits, when they saw him, fell down, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.12'>And he strongly prohibited them to make him known.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.13'>AND he ascended a mountain, and called those whom he willed; and they came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.14'>And he chose twelve to be with him, and to send them to preach,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.15'>and to have authority to heal diseases and to cast out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.16'>And he named to Shemun the name of Kipha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.17'>and upon Jacub bar Zabdai, and Juchanon the brother of Jacub, he set the name of B'nai-regesh, which is, (B'nai-râmo,) Sons of thunder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.18'>And Andreas, and Philipos, and Bar-Thulmai, and Mathai, and Thoma, and Jacub bar Chalphai, and Thadai, and Shemun the Zealous,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.19'>and Jihuda S'carjuta,-he who betrayed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.20'>And they came to the house: and the assemblies gathered again, so that they could not eat bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.21'>And his relatives heard, and came forth to take him; for they said, He hath gone out of himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.22'>And the Sophree, they who had come down from Urishlem, said, Belzebub is in him, and by the prince of devils he casteth out devils.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.23'>And Jeshu called them, and by similitudes said to them, How can Satan cast out Satan?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.24'>For if a kingdom against itself be divided, that kingdom cannot stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.25'>and if a house against itself be divided, that house cannot stand;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.26'>and if Satan rise against Satan, and be divided, he cannot stand, but his end is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.27'>No one can enter into the house of the strong, and spoil his goods, unless first the strong one he bind; and then his house he may destroy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.28'>Amen I say to you, That all sin and blasphemy which the sons of men blaspheme may be remitted them;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.29'>but whosoever shall blaspheme against the Spirit of Holiness hath no remission for ever, but is condemned to the judgment that is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.30'>Because they had said that an unclean spirit was in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.31'>AND there came his mother and his brethren, standing without; and they sent to call him to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.32'>But the congregation sat about him. And they say to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren without inquire for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.33'>And he answered, and said to them, Who is my mother, and who are my brethren?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.34'>And looking upon those who sat with him, he said, Behold my mother, and behold my brethren:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.3.35'>for whosoever shall do the will of Aloha, he is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.4'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.1'>And he began again to teach by the sea-side: and great assemblies were gathered to him; so that, ascending, he sat in a bark on the sea, and the whole multitude stood on the land, by the edge of the water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.2'>And he instructed them by many parables, and said in his teaching,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.3'>Listen: Behold, a sower went forth to sow;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.4'>and as he sowed, some fell by the way-side, and the fowl came and devoured it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.5'>And other fell upon the rock, so that it had not much earth; and it soon came up, because it had not depth of earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.6'>but when the sun arose, it became hot; and inasmuch as it had no root, it dried up.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.7'>And other fell in a place of thorns; and the thorns sprang up, and choked it, and it gave no fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.8'>But other fell upon good ground; and it came up, and grew, and gave fruits, some thirty, some sixty, and some a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.9'>And he said, Whoever hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.10'>And when he was alone, they who were with him along with his twelve inquired of him that parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.11'>And Jeshu said to them, To you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of Aloha; but to those without every thing is in parables:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.12'>that while seeing they may see, and not see; and while hearing they may hear, and not understand; lest they should be converted, and their sins be forgiven them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.13'>And he said to them, Do you not know this parable? how will you know all parables?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.14'>The sower who sowed, the word sowed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.15'>These which were by the way-side, these are they in whom the word is sown; and when they have heard, immediately cometh Satana, and taketh up the word which was sowed in their heart.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.16'>And these who upon the rock are sowed, these are they who, when they have heard the word, at once with joy receive it:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.17'>but they have no root in themselves, but are (only) for a time; and when there is affliction or persecution on account of the word, they are soon offended.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.18'>And these who in the place of thorns are sown, these are they who hear the word;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.19'>and the care of this world, and the deceptiveness of wealth, and the remainder of other lusts, entering, choke the word, and it is without fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.20'>And these who in good ground are sowed, these are they who hear the word, and receive, and give fruits, thirty, and sixty, and a hundred.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.21'>And he said to them, A lamp never cometh to be put under a measure, or under a bed: is it not set upon a candlestick?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.22'>For nothing is hid which shall not be revealed; nor is there any thing in secret which is not to be manifested.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.23'>If any man hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.24'>AND he said to them, Consider what you hear. With that measure which you mete, you shall have measured to you; and there shall be, added to you those which you hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.25'>For whosoever hath, unto him shall be given; and whosoever hath not, that also which he hath shall be taken from him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.26'>And he said, So is the kingdom of God, as a man who shall cast seed into the earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.27'>and shall sleep, and rise up by night and day, and the seed shall increase, and become long, while he knoweth not,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.28'>For the earth yieldeth him fruit; and first is there the plant, and after it the ear, but lastly the completed corn in the ear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.29'>But when the fruit is mature, immediately cometh the sickle, because the harvest is come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.30'>And he said, To what may we compare the kingdom of Aloha? and with what comparison shall we compare it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.31'>It is like a grain of mustard, which, when sown in the earth, is smaller than all seeds which are in the earth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.32'>and when it is sown, it springeth up, and becometh greater than all herbs, and maketh great branches; so that in its shadow the fowl can dwell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.33'>In parables such as these spake Jeshu with them, in parables such as they could hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.34'>And without parable did he not speak with them: but to his disciples, between him and them, he explained all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.35'>AND he said to them that day, in the evening, Let us pass to the opposite shore.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.36'>And they sent away the assembles, and took him into the vessel; and other vessels were with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.37'>And there was a great commotion and wind, and the waves fell upon the vessel, which was nigh being filled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.38'>But Jeshu upon a pillow slept in the after-part of the vessel, and they came and raised him, saying to him, Raban, hast thou no care that we are perishing?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.39'>And he arose, and restrained the wind, and said to the sea, Peace, be silent. And the wind ceased, and there was a great stillness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.40'>And he said to them, Why feared ye? how is it ye have no faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.4.41'>And they feared with great fear, and said among themselves, Who is this, to whom the winds and the sea are obedient?</verse>

      <chapter osisID='Mark.5'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.1'>AND they came to the other side of the sea, to the region of the Gadroyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.2'>And when he had come from the vessel, there met him from the place of tombs a man who had an unclean spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.3'>and he dwelt in the place of tombs; and with chains no man could bind him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.4'>for, so often as with shackles and chains he had been bound, the chains he had broken, and the shackles he had burst asunder; and no man could subdue him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.5'>And at all time, by night and by day, he was in the place of tombs, and in the mountains, crying out, and bruising himself with stones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.6'>But when he saw Jeshu from afar, he ran, worshipped him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.7'>and cried with a high voice, and said, What to me and to thee, Jeshu, Son of Aloha the Most High? I adjure thee by Aloha, that thou torment me not!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.8'>For he had said to him, Come forth from the man, unclean spirit!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.9'>And he questioned him, How is thy name? And he said to him, Legion is our name, because we are many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.10'>And he besought him much that he would not send him out of the region.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.11'>Now at the mountain there was a great herd of swine feeding.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.12'>And the devils besought him, saying, Send us into those swine, that into them we may enter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.13'>And he suffered them. And those unclean spirits went forth and entered into the swine; and that herd ran to the rock, and plunged into the sea, as two thousand, and were drowned in the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.14'>And they who kept them fled, and told in the city, and also in the hamlets; and they came forth to see what was done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.15'>And they came to Jeshu, and saw him who (had had) the devils, sitting, clothed, and sane; him, who had had in him the legion and they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.16'>And they who had seen, related to them what had been done to him who had had the devils, and also concerning those swine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.17'>And they began to beg of him to go from their coast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.18'>And when he had ascended the vessel, he in whom had been the devils besought him that he might be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.19'>But he permitted him not; but said to him, Go to thy house, to thy men, and show them what the Lord hath done for thee, and (how he) hath had mercy on thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.20'>And he went, and began to preach in the ten cities what Jeshu had done for him: and all marvelled.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.21'>AND when Jeshu had passed in the vessel to the opposite side, there were again congregated unto him great gatherings, while he was upon the shore of the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.22'>And there came one whose name was Jorosh, one of the masters of the synagogue; and when he saw him, he fell at his feet,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.23'>and besought him much, saying to him, My daughter is greatly afflicted; come, lay thy hand upon her, and she will be healed, and live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.24'>And Jeshu went with him; and a great multitude adhered to him, and oppressed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.25'>But a certain woman, who had a defluxion of blood twelve years,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.26'>who much had suffered from many physicians, and had expended all whatever she had, and was nothing helped, but also the more afflicted,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.27'>having heard of Jeshu, came in the press of the crowd behind him, and touched his vestment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.28'>For she said, If I but touch his vestment, I shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.29'>And immediately the fountain of her blood was dried; and she felt in her body that she had been healed from her plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.30'>But Jeshu at once knew within himself that power had gone forth from him, and he turned to the crowd, and said, Who touched my garments?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.31'>His disciples say to him, Thou seest the crowds that oppress thee, and sayest thou, Who touched me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.32'>And he looked round to see who this had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.33'>But the woman herself, fearing and trembling, because she knew what had been done for her, came, fell before him, and told him all the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.34'>But he said to her, My daughter, thy faith hath saved thee; go in peace, and be healed from thy plague.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.35'>And while he was speaking, there came some of the house of the master of the synagogue, saying, Thy daughter is dead: for what then art thou wearying the Teacher?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.36'>But Jeshu heard the word which they spake, and said to the master of the synagogue, Fear not, only believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.37'>And he did not permit any one to go with him, except Shemun Kipha, and Jacub, and Juchanon, brother of Jacub.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.38'>And they came to the house of that master of the synagogue, and he saw how they made a tumult, and wept and bewailed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.39'>And he entered, and said to them, Why make you a tumult, and weep? the damsel is not dead, but asleep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.40'>And they derided him. But Jeshu put them all forth, and took the father of the damsel, and her mother, and those who were with her, and went in where the damsel was lying.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.41'>And he took the hand of the damsel, and said to her, Damsel, arise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.42'>And forthwith the damsel arose, and walked; for she was a daughter of twelve years. And they wondered with great admiration.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.5.43'>And he charged them greatly that no one should know this, and spake that they should give her (somewhat) to eat.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.6'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.1'>AND Jeshu went forth from thence, and came to his city; and his disciples adhered to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.2'>And when it was shabath, he began to teach in the house of the congregation: and many who heard wondered, and said, Whence to him are these? and what is this wisdom which hath been given him, that miracles such as these by his hands should be done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.3'>Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mariam, and the brother of Jacub, and of Josi, and of Jehuda, and of Shemun? and are not his sisters here with us? And they were offended with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.4'>And Jeshu said to them, No prophet is despised, unless in his own city, and among his kinsfolk, and in his own house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.5'>And he could not do there any miracle, except that upon a few sick he laid his hands, and healed them</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.6'>And he wondered at the defectiveness of their faith. AND he itinerated through the villages, teaching.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.7'>And he called his twelve, and began to send them two and two; and gave them power over unclean spirits to cast them out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.8'>And he instructed them to take nothing for the journey, except a staff only; not a wallet, nor bread, nor brass in their purses;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.9'>but be shod with sandals, and not to be clothed with two tunics.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.10'>And he said to them, Into whatsoever house you enter, there be until you go forth from thence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.11'>And every one who will not receive you, nor hear you, when you are going out from thence, beat off the dust that is beneath your feet for their testimony. And Amen I say to you, That it shall be more tolerable for Sadum and for Amura in the day of the judgment, than for that city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.12'>And they went forth, and preached that they should repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.13'>And many devils they cast out, and anointed with oil the sick, and healed many.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.14'>AND Herodes the king heard concerning Jeshu, for his name had become known; and he said, Juchanon the Baptizer hath risen from among the dead; therefore works of power are wrought by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.15'>Others said, He is Elia; and others, A prophet as one from the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.16'>But when Herodes heard, he said, It is Juchanon whom I beheaded; he hath risen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.17'>For Herodes had sent and had taken Juchanon, and had cast him into the house of the bound, on account of Herodia, wife of Philipos his brother, whom he had taken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.18'>For Juchanon had said to Herodes, It is not lawful to thee to take the wife of thy brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.19'>But Herodia herself was adverse to him, and wished to kill him, but she could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.20'>For Herodes feared Juchanon, because he knew that he was a man righteous and holy, and he protected him, and was many (times) hearing him, doing, and hearing him favourably.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.21'>And there was a notable day when Herodes, in the house of his nativity, (b'beth yaldeh,) made a feast to his chiefs and kiliarchs and the heads of Galila;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.22'>and the daughter of Herodia came in (and) danced; and she pleased Herodes and them who reclined with him. And the king said to the damsel, Ask of me whatever thou wilt, and I will give to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.23'>And he sware to her, Whatever thou shalt ask (of) me, I will give thee, unto the dividing of my kingdom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.24'>Then went she out and said to her mother, What shall I ask of him? She saith to her, The head of Juchanon the Baptizer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.25'>And immediately she entered with solicitude unto the king, and saith to him, I will this hour that thou give me, upon a dish, the head of Juchanon the Baptizer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.26'>And greatly grieved was the king; but, for the sake of the oath, and the sake of the guests, he could not deprive her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.27'>But the king despatched at once a sentinel, and commanded that he should bring the head of Juchanon. And he went and cut off the head of Juchanon in the house of the bound,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.28'>and brought (it) in a dish and gave to the damsel, and the damsel herself gave to her mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.29'>And his disciples heard and went, took up his corpse, and laid it in the place of the buried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.30'>AND the disciples gathered unto Jeshu, and told him all whatever they had done, and whatever they had taught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.31'>And he said to them, Come and let us go into the desert alone, and rest a little while; for there were multitudes going and coming, (so that) they had not space even to eat;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.32'>and they went to a wilderness district in a vessel by themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.33'>And many saw them as they went, and knew them; and into the waste ran they from all the cities, and were there before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.34'>And Jeshu coming forth beheld the great assemblies, and had compassion upon them, they being like sheep which had no shepherd; and he began to teach them many things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.35'>And when much time had passed, the disciples came to him and said to him, This place is waste, and the time is great;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.36'>send them away to go to the farms around us and into the villages, and buy for themselves bread, for they have nothing to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.37'>But he said to them, Give you them to eat. They said to him, Shall we go and buy bread for two hundred dinoreen, and give them to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.38'>But he said, Go see how many loaves you have here; and when they had seen, they said to him, Five loaves and two fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.39'>And he directed that they should make them all recline in companies upon the herbage;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.40'>and they reclined in companies, by hundreds and by fifties.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.41'>And he took the five loaves and the two fishes, and looked up to heaven, and blessed, and brake the bread, and gave to his disciples to set before them: and those two fishes they divided among them all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.42'>and they all did eat and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.43'>And they took up the broken pieces, twelve baskets full, and from the fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.44'>Now they who had eaten bread were five thousand men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.45'>And immediately he constrained his disciples to ascend into the bark, and to go before him across to Beth-tsaida, while he dismissed the assemblies;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.46'>and when he had sent them away, he went to a mountain to pray.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.47'>BUT when it was eventide, the bark was in the midst of the sea, and himself alone upon the land.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.48'>And he saw them that they were distressed with rowing; for the wind was against them. And in the fourth watch of the night Jeshu came to them walking upon the waters, (as though) he willed to pass by them:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.49'>but they beheld him walking upon the waters, and thought it was a spectre, and they cried out;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.50'>for all saw him and were afraid. But he immediately spoke to them and said to them, Take heart, I am, fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.51'>And he ascended to them into the ship, and the wind was still: and they wondered greatly, and were astonished among themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.52'>For they understood not from that bread, because their heart was gross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.53'>And when they had crossed over, they came to the land of Genesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.54'>And when they had gone forth from the bark, the men of the place at once recognised him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.55'>And they ran throughout all that land, and began to bring those who were greatly afflicted, bearing them on couchettes, to where they heard that he was.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.6.56'>And wherever he entered, into villages and cities, they placed the sick in the streets, and besought from him that they might touch only the edge of his mantle; and all they who touched him were healed.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.7'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.1'>AND there gathered to him Pharishee and Sophree, who had come from Urishlem;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.2'>and they saw some of his disciples eating bread with their hands not washed; and they complained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.3'>For all the Jihudoyee and Pharishee, unless they carefully wash their hands, do not eat, because they hold the tradition of the elders;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.4'>and (coming) from the market, unless they lave, they eat not. And many other of those (things) there are which they have received to observe, (as) the baptisms of cups, and of measures, and of brasen utensils, and of beds.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.5'>And the Sophree and Pharishee questioned him, Why do not your disciples walk according to the tradition of the elders; but, while their hands are not washed, eat bread?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.6'>But he said to them, Well prophesied concerning you Eshaia the prophet, you hypocrites; as it is written, This people with their lips honour me, but their heart is very far from me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.7'>But in vain do they reverence me while they teach the teachings of the commandments of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.8'>For you have abandoned the commandment of God and hold the tradition of men, as the baptisms of cups and measures, and many things like these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.9'>He said to them (moreover), You decently suppress the commandment of God, that you may establish your tradition.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.10'>For Musha hath said, Honour thy father and thy mother; and whosoever curseth father and mother, the death he shall die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.11'>But you say, If a man shall say to his father, or to his mother, My oblation, (be that) whatever from me thou mayest profit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.12'>and you permit him not to do any thing for his father and his mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.13'>But you reject the word of Aloha for the sake of the tradition which you have delivered: and many similar (observances) to these you practise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.14'>And Jeshu called the whole multitude, and said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.15'>It is not that which is without the man, and which entereth into him, that can defile him: but that which proceedeth from him, that defileth a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.16'>He who hath ears to hear, let him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.17'>But when Jeshu had gone into the house (apart) from the multitude, his disciples asked him concerning that parable.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.18'>He said to them, How dull are even you! Know you not, that nothing from without that entereth a man can defile him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.19'>because it entereth not into his heart, but into his belly, and is cast out in the purgation which all food purgeth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.20'>But that which proceedeth from a man, that polluteth a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.21'>For from within, from the heart of the sons of men, go forth evil thoughts, adultery, fornication, robbery, murder,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.22'>rapacity, malice, fraud, obscenity, an evil eye, blasphemy, vain-glory, folly;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.23'>all these evils come from within, and they defile a man.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.24'>FROM thence Jeshu arose and went to the confine of Tsur and of Tsaidon, and entered into a certain house: and he was unwilling that any man should know of him, but he could not conceal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.25'>For immediately heard a certain woman concerning him, whose daughter had an unclean spirit; and she came, (and) fell before his feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.26'>But that woman was a Gentile of Phuniki of Suria, and she prayed of him to cast out the demon from her daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.27'>But Jeshu said to her, Let the children first be filled; for it is not well to take the bread of the children and cast it to the dogs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.28'>But she answering said to him, Yes, my Lord, yet the dogs also from beneath the table eat the crumbs of the children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.29'>Jeshu saith to her, Go; on account of that word, the demon hath gone forth from thy daughter.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.30'>And she went to her house, and found her daughter lying on the couch, and the demon had gone out from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.31'>Jeshu again departed from the confine of Tsur and of Tsaidon, and came to the sea of Galila, on the confine of the Ten Cities;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.32'>and they brought to him a blind man, a stammerer, and besought him to lay upon him the hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.33'>And he took him aside from the crowd by himself, and put his fingers in his ears, and spat, and touched his tongue.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.34'>And he looked up to heaven, and sighed, and said to him, Be opened:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.35'>and in that hour his ears were opened, and the bond of his tongue was loosed, and he spake plainly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.36'>And he charged them that to no man they should tell this. But so much as he charged them, they the more proclaimed it;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.7.37'>and they were exceedingly astonished, and said, He doeth every thing well; the deaf he maketh to hear, and them who spoke not, to speak.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.8'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.1'>BUT in those days when the multitude was great and there was nothing for them to eat, he called his disciples, and said to them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.2'>I have compassion on this multitude, for behold three days have they continued with me, and there is nothing which they may eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.3'>And if it be that I send them away fasting to their houses, they will faint in the way; for some of them come from afar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.4'>His disciples say to him, Whence can any one here in the wilderness satisfy with bread all these?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.5'>And he asked them, How many loaves have you? They say to him, Seven;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.6'>and he directed the multitudes to recline upon the ground, and he took those seven loaves, and blessed and brake and gave to his disciples that they should set, and they set before the assemblies.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.7'>And there were fishes, a few: and also over them he blessed, and said that they should set them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.8'>And they all ate and were satisfied, and took up the abundancies of the fragments, seven panniers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.9'>Now the men who had eaten were about four thousand: and he dismissed them,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.10'>and immediately ascended into a vessel with his disciples, and came to the region of Dalmanutha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.11'>AND there came forth Pharishee, and began to question with him, and they demanded of him the sign from heaven, tempting him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.12'>And he groaned in his spirit, and said, Why seeketh this generation the sign? Amen I say to you, There shall not be given the sign unto this generation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.13'>And he left them, and ascended into the ship, and went to that overland.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.14'>And they had forgotten to take with them bread, and but one cake was with them in the ship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.15'>And he counselled them, and said to them, Look and beware of the leaven of the Pharishee, and of the leaven of Herodes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.16'>And they reasoned one with another, saying, Because we have no bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.17'>But Jeshu knew, and said to them, Why reason you because you have no bread? do you not yet know nor under stand? is your heart still hard?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.18'>and eyes have you, and not see? and ears have you, and not hear? neither remember you?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.21'>He saith to them, How do you not yet understand?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.22'>And he came to Beth-tsaida; and they brought to him a blind man, and prayed of him to touch him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.24'>And he looked, and said, I see the sons of man as the trees, walking.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.25'>Again he laid his hand upon his eyes, and he was restored, and he saw every thing clearly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.26'>And he sent him to his house, and told him to go not into the village, nor to inform any man in the village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.27'>And Jeshu went forth and his disciples into the villages of Kesarea of Philipos, and he interrogated his disciples by the way, saying to them, What say men concerning me that I am?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.28'>But they answered, That (thou art) Juchanon the Baptizer; and others, that (thou art) Elia; and others, one from the prophets.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.29'>Jeshu said to them, But you, what say you concerning me that I am? Shemun Kipha answered and said to him, Thus art the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha the Living.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.31'>And he began to teach them, that it was to be that the Son of man should suffer much, and be rejected by the elders, and by the chief priests, and by the Sophree, and be killed, and that the third day he should arise!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.32'>And he spake the word with them fully. And Kipha took him, and began to chide him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.33'>But he turned, and, beholding his disciples, reprehended Shemun, and said, Get thee behind me, Satana, for thou thinkest not that which is of Aloha, but that which is of the sons of men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.34'>AND Jeshu called to the assemblies with his disciples, and said to them, Whoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.35'>For every one who willeth to save his life shall lose it; and every one who shall lose his life on account of me and on account of my gospel, shall save it.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.8.37'>Or what shall a son of man give (as) the compensation for his soul?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.8.38'>For whoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this generation, sinful and adulterous, the Son of man will also be ashamed of him, when he cometh in the glory of his Father with the holy angels.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.2'>And after six days Jeshu took Kipha, and Jacub, and Juchanon, and led them up to a high mountain by themselves. And he was altered before their eyes:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.3'>and his raiment shone, and became exceeding white as the snow; as the sons of man on earth could not make white.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.4'>And there were seen with them Musha and Elia discoursing with Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.5'>And Kipha said to him, Rabi, it is good for us here to be: and let us make three tabernacles; for thee one, and for Musha one, and for Elia one.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.7'>And there was the cloud, and it shadowed over them: and the voice was from the cloud, saying, This is my Son, the Beloved, him hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.8'>And instantly, while the disciples looked, they saw no man, but Jeshu alone with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.9'>And while they were descending from the mountain, he charged them to tell no man what they had seen, until the Son of man should have arisen from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.10'>And they held discourse among themselves, and inquired what was this word, when he should have arisen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.11'>And they asked him, saying, How then say the Sophree that Elia must come before?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.12'>He said to them, Elia doth come before, to restore all things; and how it is written concerning the Son of man, that much he should suffer, and be rejected.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.14'>AND when he came to his disciples, he saw with them a great crowd, and the Sophree questioning with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.15'>And immediately all the crowd saw him, and wondered, and ran to salute him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.16'>And he inquired of the Sophree, What dispute you with them?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.17'>And one from the company answered and said, Malphona, I had brought my son to thee, because he hath a spirit which speaketh not;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.18'>and when he seizeth him, he dasheth him, and teareth and grindeth his teeth, and he becometh dry. And I spake to thy disciples that they should cast him out, but they could not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.19'>Jeshu answered, and said to him, O generation that believeth not! how long shall I be with you? how long shall I tolerate you? bring him to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.20'>And they brought him unto him: and when the spirit saw him, he immediately dashed him, and he fell upon the ground; and was convulsed, and was torn.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.21'>And Jeshu asked the father, How long is it from the time from which it was thus? He saith to him, Behold, from his childhood.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.22'>And many times he casteth him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but whatever thou canst, help me, and have mercy upon me.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.24'>And in a moment the father of the youth cried out, weeping and saying, I am believing; help the defect of my faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.25'>But when Jeshu saw the people running together, and assembling to him, he rebuked the unclean spirit, and said to him, Spirit, deaf and unspeaking! I command thee, come forth from him, and enter not into him again!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.26'>And that devil cried greatly, and crushed him, and went forth. And he became as the dead; as that many would say, He is dead.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.28'>But when Jeshu had gone into the house, his disciples inquired of him by themselves, Why could not we cast him out?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.29'>Jeshu said to them, This kind with nothing can be cast out, but by fasting and prayer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.30'>And when he had gone forth from thence, they passed into Galila: and he was not willing that any man should know of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.9.31'>And he taught his disciples, and told them, That the Son of man would be delivered into the hands of men, and they would kill him; and that when he was slain, on the third day he should arise.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.9.47'>And if thine eye offend thee, root it out: better for thee that with one eye thou enter the kingdom of Aloha, than having two eyes to fall into the gihana of fire:</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.1'>And he began to discourse with them in parables. A certain man planted a vinery, and surrounded it with an enclosure, and dug in it a wine-press, and built in it a tower, and gave it to be held by husbandmen, and journeyed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.2'>And he sent to the husbandmen his servant in the time to receive the fruits of the vinery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.3'>But they beat him, and sent him away empty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.4'>He sent to them again another servant; and also that one they stoned, and bruised him, and sent him away with dishonour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.5'>And he sent again another, and him they killed; and many other servants he sent, and of them they beat, (and) of them they killed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.6'>But at last having one son, the beloved, he sent him to them; for he said, Now will they be confounded by my son.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.8'>And they took and killed him, and cast him without from the vinery.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.9'>What therefore shall the Lord of the vinery do? He will come, destroy those labourers, and will give the vinery to others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.10'>And also that scripture have you not read, The stone which the builders rejected is become the head of the corner?</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.12'>And they sought to apprehend him, but feared from the people: for they knew that concerning themselves he had spoken this parable. And he left them, and went.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.14'>And they came and questioned him: Malphona, we know that thou art true, and that thou bearest not care for man: for thou regardest not the person of the sons of man, but in truth the way of Aloha thou teachest: Is it lawful to give headmoney to Caesar, or not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.15'>shall we give, or shall we not give? But he knew their deceit, and said to them, Why do you tempt me? bring me the dinara, (that) I may see it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.16'>And they brought it to him. He said to them, Of whom (is) this image and writing? And they said, Of Caesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.17'>Jeshu said to them, Of Caesar give to Caesar, and of Aloha to Aloha. And they were astonished at him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.18'>AND the Zadukoyee came to him, those who say that (there is) no resurrection; and they questioned him, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.19'>Malphona, Musha has written for us, That if the brother of a man die, and leave a wife, and leave not children, his brother shall take his wife and raise up seed unto his brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.20'>Seven brethren there were. The first took a wife, and died, and left not seed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.21'>And the second took her, and died, and he also left not seed: and the third likewise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.22'>And the seven of them took her, and did not leave seed: last of all died also that woman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.23'>In the resurrection therefore, whose from them shall she be the wife? for the seven of them had her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.24'>Jeshu saith to them, Do you not on this account err, because you know not the scripture, nor the power of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.25'>For when they rise from the dead, they take not wives, neither are wives (given) unto husbands; but as the angels that are in heaven are they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.26'>But concerning the dead, that they rise: have you not read in the book of Musha, how from the bush Aloha said to him, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Ishok, and the God of Jacub?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.27'>And Aloha is not of the dead, but of the living. You therefore do greatly err.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.28'>AND one from the Sophree approached and heard how they disputed, and, perceiving that he had well rendered to them the answer, inquired of him, Which is the first commandment of all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.29'>Jeshu saith to him, The first of all the commandments (is), Hear, Israel, The Lord our Aloha is one Lord:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.30'>and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the first commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.31'>And the second, which is like it, (is) that thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. Another commandment greater than these there is not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.32'>That Sophra said to him, Well, Rabi, and truly hast thou spoken: for One there is and no other than He:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.33'>and that a man love Him with all the heart, and with all the understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the strength, and that he love his neighbour as himself, is better than all burnt-offerings and sacrifices.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.34'>Jeshu, seeing that he had wisely returned the word, answered and said to him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of Aloha. And no man dared again to question him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.35'>And Jeshu answered and said, while he taught in the temple, How say the Sophree that the Meshicha is son of David?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.36'>For David himself saith by the Spirit of Holiness, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I set thy adversaries a footstool beneath thy feet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.37'>David therefore himself calleth him My Lord; and how is he then his son? And all the multitude heard him gladly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.38'>And in his doctrine he said to them, Beware of the Sophree, who will to walk in long robes, and love the shaloma in public places,</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.12.40'>they who devour the houses of widows, and for the occasion prolong their prayers: they shall receive the greater judgment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.41'>AND as Jeshu sat before the house of treasure, he beheld how the multitude cast money into the place of treasure; and many rich threw in much.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.42'>And there came a certain poor widow, and threw in two menin, which are a shemona.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.43'>And Jeshu called to his disciples, and said to them, Amen I tell you, That this poor widow more than all the men who throw hath thrown into the house of treasure.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.12.44'>For all they from what is (super)abundant to them have thrown (in), but this from her deficiency all whatever she had; she hath thrown in her whole possession.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.13.5'>But he, Jeshu, began to say to them, See that no man deceive you.</verse>

        <verse osisID='Mark.14.65'>And some began to spit on his person, and they struck him on his face, and did buffet him, saying, Prophesy! and the servitors struck him upon his cheeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.66'>And Shemun being below in the court, there came a certain damsel of the chief of the priests.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.67'>She saw him as he warmed (himself), and knew him, saying to him, Thou also wast with Jeshu Natsroia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.68'>But he denied, and said, I know not what thou sayest. And he went without into the vestibule; and the cock crew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.69'>And again that damsel saw him, and she began to say to those who were standing, This man is also of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.70'>But he again denied. And after a little while those who stood said to Kipha, Assuredly thou art from them, for thou art also a Galiloia, and thy speech is similar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.71'>But he began to imprecate and to swear, I know not this man of whom thou speakest. And in the hour the cock crew the second time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.14.72'>And Shemun remembered the word that Jeshu had spoken to him, That before the cock should crow twice, three times thou shalt deny me. And he began to weep.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.15'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.1'>AND forthwith in the morning the chief priests with the elders and with the scribes and with the whole congregation made council; and they bound Jeshu, and led him and delivered him to Pilatos the governor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.2'>And Pilatos asked him, Art thou the King of the Jihudoyee? And he replied and said to him, Thou hast said.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.3'>And the chief priests accused him of many (things):</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.4'>but he, Pilatos, asked him again and said to him, Returnest thou not an answer? see how many are witnessing against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.5'>But he, Jeshu, did not give any answer; so that Pilatos admired.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.6'>But he was accustomed at every festival to release to them of the bound one whom they requested;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.7'>and there was one who was called Bar-aba, who was bound with the makers of sedition, they who murder in the sedition had committed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.8'>And the people cried out and began to demand, that as he was used he would do to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.9'>But Pilatos answered and said, Will you that I release to you the King of the Jihudoyee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.10'>For Pilatos knew that for envy the chief priests had delivered him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.11'>But the chief priests the more incited the multitude, that Bar-aba he should release to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.12'>But he, Pilatos, said to them, What then will you that I do to this, whom ye call King of the Jihudoyee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.13'>And they again cried, Crucify him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.14'>Pilatos said to them, Why? what evil hath he done? And they the more exceedingly cried, Crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.15'>But Pilatos was willing to serve the will of the people, and released to them Bar-aba, and delivered up to them Jeshu, scourged, to be crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.16'>And the soldiers led him into the court which is the praetorium, and called the whole band;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.17'>and they robed him in purple, and twisted and set upon him a crown of thorns,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.18'>and they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jihudoyee!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.19'>and they struck him upon the head with a cane, and spat in his face, and kneeled upon their knees and worshipped him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.20'>And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple, and clothed him with his own vestments, and led him forth to crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.21'>AND they constrained one who was passing, Shemun Kurinoia, who was coming from the field, the father of Alexander and of Rufus, to bear his cross.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.22'>And they brought him to Gogultha, a place which is interpreted A skull.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.23'>And they gave him to drink wine which was mixed with myrrh; but he would not receive.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.24'>And when they had crucified him, they parted his garments, and cast for them lots who should take them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.25'>And it was the third hour when they crucified him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.26'>And there was written the occasion of his death in the inscription, This is the King of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.27'>And they crucified with him two thieves, one on his right and one on his left;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.28'>and was accomplished the Scripture which said, That with the wicked he was reckoned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.29'>AND they also who passed by blasphemed against him, wagging their heads and saying, Ho, undoer of the temple and builder of it in three days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.30'>deliver thyself and come down from the cross!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.31'>And so also the chief priests laughing one with one, and the Sophree, and saying, Others he saved, himself he cannot save.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.32'>The Meshicha King of Isroel, let him descend now from the cross, that we may see and believe on him; and they also who were crucified with him reviled him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.33'>AND when it was the sixth hour, there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.34'>And in the ninth hour Jeshu cried with a high voice and said, Il, Il, Lamona Shabaktoni! Which is, Alohi! Alohi! why hast thou forsaken me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.35'>And certain who heard, of them who were standing, said, Elia he calleth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.36'>but one ran and filled a sponge with vinegar, and bound it on a rod that he might drink. And they said, Let alone, we will see if Elia cometh to take him down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.37'>But he, Jeshu, cried with a high voice, and completed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.38'>and the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.39'>But when that centurion who stood near him saw that he cried thus, and ended, (he) said, Assuredly this man was the Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.40'>And there were women from afar who were beholding; Mariam Magdalitha, and Mariam mother of Jacub the less and of Josi, and Shaloom;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.41'>those who, when he was in Galila, adhered to him, and ministered to him, and many others who went up with him to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.42'>AND when it was evening of the preparation which is before the shabath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.43'>came Jauseph, he who was from Rometha, an honourable counsellor, who also himself waited for the kingdom of Aloha. And he took courage, and went in to Pilatos and requested the body of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.44'>But Pilatos wondered if he were now dead; and he called the centurion and asked him whether before the time he was dead:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.45'>and when he had learned, he gave the body to Jauseph.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.46'>And Jauseph bought linen, and took him down and wrapped him in it, and laid him in a sepulchre which was hewn in the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the sepulchre.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.15.47'>But Mariam Magdalitha and Mariam, she who was (the mother) of Josi, beheld where he was laid.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Mark.16'>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.1'>And when the shabath had passed Mariam Magdalitha and Mariam, (the mother) of Jacub and Shaloom, bought aromatics, and came to anoint him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.2'>BUT in the morning of the first day in the week, they came to the sepulchre when the sun had risen,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.3'>and they said between themselves, Who will roll away the stone for us from the door of the sepulchre?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.4'>And they looked and saw that the stone was rolled away, for it was very great.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.5'>And they went into the sepulchre, and saw a youth sitting on the right. And he was clothed in a white robe. And they were astonished.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.6'>But he said to them, Fear not! Jeshu Natsroia you seek, he who was crucified, he has risen; he is not here. Behold the place where he lay.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.7'>But go, tell his disciples and Kipha that, behold, he goeth before you into Galila; there shall you see him as he told you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.8'>And when they had heard, they fled, and went forth from the sepulchre, for astonishment and tremor had seized them; and they said nothing to any one, for they were afraid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.9'>But in the morning of the first day of the week he arose, and was first seen by Mariam Magdalitha, she who had seven devils cast out from her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.10'>And she went and declared to them who were with her, who mourned and wept.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.11'>And they, when they had heard what they told, that he lived and had appeared to them, believed them not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.12'>After these things he appeared to two of them in another fashion as they walked and went to a village.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.13'>And they went and told the rest, neither did they believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.14'>BUT afterward he appeared to the eleven as they reclined, and he reproved the littleness of their faith and the hardness of their heart, because those who had seen that he had arisen they had not believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.15'>And he said to them, Go into all the world, and proclaim my gospel to every creature:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.16'>He who believeth and is baptized is saved; and he who believeth not is condemned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.17'>And these signs shall follow those who believe: In my name they shall cast out devils, and with new tongues shall they speak;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.18'>and serpents they shalt take up; and if the poison of death they drink, it shall not hurt them; and their hands shall they lay upon the sick, and they shall be healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.19'>But Jeshu our Lord, after he had spoken with them, unto the heavens ascended, and sat on the right hand of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Mark.16.20'>And they went forth and preached in every place, and our Lord helped them, and confirmed their words by the signs which they wrought.</verse>
