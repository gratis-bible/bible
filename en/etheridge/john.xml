      <chapter osisID='John.1'>
        <verse osisID='John.1.1'>IN the beginning was the Word, and the Word himself was with Aloha, and Aloha was the Word himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.2'>This was in the beginning with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.3'>Every thing by his hand was made; and without him also was not one thing made that was made.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.4'>In him was life, and the life is the light of the sons of man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.5'>and the Light himself in the darkness shineth, and the darkness perceived him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.6'>There was a man who was sent from Aloha, his name (was) Juchanon.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.7'>He came for the testimony, to testify concerning the Light, that all men might believe through his ministry.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.8'>He was not the Light himself, but came to testify concerning the Light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.9'>For that was the true Light that enlighteneth every man who cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.10'>In the world was he, and the world by his hand had been made, and the world knew him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.11'>He came to his own, and his own received him not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.12'>But they who received him, he gave to them power, that the sons of Aloha they should become, to those who believe in his name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.13'>These, not from blood, nor from the will of the flesh, nor from the will of man, but from Aloha, are born.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.14'>And the Word flesh was made, and tabernacled with us; and we saw his glory, the glory as of the one-begotten who (was) from the Father, full of grace and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.15'>Juchanon testified concerning him, and cried, and said, This is he of whom I said, that he cometh after me, and was before me, because he is anterior to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.16'>And from his fulness we all have received, and grace for grace.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.17'>For the law by the hand of Musha was given; but the truth and the grace were by Jeshu Meshicha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.18'>ALOHA no man hath ever seen: the one-begotten God, he who is in the bosom of his Father, he hath declared him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.19'>And this was the testimony of Juchanon, when the Jihudoyee sent to him from Urishlem priests and Levoyee to demand of him, Who art thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.20'>And he confessed, and denied not, but confessed, I am not the Meshicha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.21'>And they asked him again, What then? art thou Elia? And he said, I am not. Art thou the Prophet? And he said, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.22'>And they said to him, And who art thou? that we may give an answer to those who sent us. What sayest thou of thyself?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.23'>He saith, I am the voice which crieth in the wilderness, Make plain the way of the Lord, as said Eshaia the prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.24'>But they who were sent were from the Pharishee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.25'>And they demanded and said to him, Why then baptizest thou, if thou art not the Meshicha, nor Elia, nor the Prophet?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.26'>Juchanon answered and said to them, I baptize you with waters; but he standeth among you whom you know not:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.27'>he it is who cometh after me, and he was before me; he, the latchets of whose shoes I am not worthy to unloose.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.28'>These things were done in Bethania, at the passage of the Jurdan, where Juchanon was baptizing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.29'>AND the day after, Juchanon seeth Jeshu, who was coming to him; and he said, Behold the Lamb of Aloha, who beareth the sin of the world!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.30'>This is he concerning whom I said, After me cometh a man, and he was before me, because he is anterior to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.31'>And I knew him not, but that he should be made known unto Isroel, therefore have I come with waters to baptize.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.32'>And Juchanon testified and said, I saw the Spirit descending from heaven as a dove, and it remained upon him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.33'>And I knew him not: but he who sent me to baptize with water, he said to me, He upon whom thou seest the Spirit descend and remain, this baptizeth with the Spirit of Holiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.34'>and I saw, and bare witness that this is the Son of Aloha</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.35'>And the day after Juchanon stood, and two of his disciples;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.36'>and, contemplating Jeshu as he walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of Aloha!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.37'>And his two disciples heard him as he spake, and they went after Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.38'>And Jeshu turned (himself), and saw them coming after him, and said to them, Whom seek you? They say to him, Raban, where dwellest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.39'>He saith to them, Come and see. And they went and saw where he dwelt; and they were with him that day: and it was about the tenth hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.40'>Now one of those who heard Juchanon and went after Jeshu, was Andreas, the brother of Shemun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.41'>This saw first Shemun his brother, and said to him, We have found the Meshicha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.42'>and he brought him to Jeshu. And Jeshu saw him, and said, Thou art Shemun bar Jona; thou shalt be called Kipha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.43'>AND the day following Jeshu willed to go forth into Galila. And he found Philipos, and said to him, Come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.44'>Now Philipos was from Beth-tsaida, from the city of Andreas and of Shemun.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.45'>Philipos found Nathanael, and said to him, Him of whom Musha in the law, and the prophets, did write we have found, (and) that Jeshu (is) he, the son of Jauseph who is from Natsrath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.46'>Saith to him Nathanael, From Natsrath can any good thing be? Philipos saith to him, Come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.47'>And Jeshu saw Nathanael as he was coming to him, and said of him, Behold truly a son of Isroel who hath no guile in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.48'>Nathanael saith to him, Whence knowest thou me? Jeshu saith to him, While yet Philipos had not called thee, while thou wast under the fig-tree, I saw thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.49'>Nathanael answered and said to him, Rabi, thou art the Son of Aloha himself, thou art the very King of Isroel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.50'>Jeshu saith to him, Upon my telling thee that I saw thee under the fig-tree, believest thou? Greater things than these thou shalt see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.1.51'>He saith to him, Amen, amen, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see the heavens opened, and the angels of Aloha ascending and descending unto the Son of man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.2'>
        <verse osisID='John.2.1'>AND on the third day there was a feast in Kotna, a city of Galila; and the mother of Jeshu was there:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.2'>and Jeshu and his disciples were called to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.3'>And the wine failed, and his mother saith to him, to Jeshu, They have no wine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.4'>Jeshu saith to her, What (is it) to me and to thee, woman? Not yet hath come mine hour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.5'>His mother saith to the servitors, Whatever he telleth you, do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.6'>Now there were six waterpots of stone set there, unto the purification of the Jihudoyee, which contained each two quarantals or three.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.7'>Jeshu saith to them, Fill these water-pots with waters; and they filled them to the top.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.8'>He saith to them, Draw now, and carry to the chief of the guests. And they carried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.9'>And when that chief of the guests had tasted those waters which were made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servitors knew, who had filled them with waters,) the chief of the guests called the bridegroom,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.10'>and said to him, Every man at first the good wine produceth, and when they are satisfied, then that which is inferior; but thou hast kept the good wine until now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.11'>This is the first sign that Jeshu wrought in Kotna of Galila, and manifested his glory; and his disciples believed in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.12'>AFTER this he went to Kapher-nachum, he and his mother and his brethren and his disciples. And they were there a few days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.13'>And the petscha of the Jihudoyee was nigh, and Jeshu went up to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.14'>And he found in the temple those who sold oxen and sheep and doves, and the money-changers sitting.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.15'>And he made him a scourge of cord, and drove them all from the temple, and the sheep and the oxen and the money-changers; and he shed their money, and their tables he overturned.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.16'>And to those who sold doves he said, Take these hence; make not the house of my Father a house of merchandise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.17'>And his disciples remembered that it was written, The zeal of thy house hath devoured me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.18'>The Jihudoyee answered and said to him, What sign showest thou to us, as these things thou doest?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.19'>Jeshu answered, Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.20'>The Jihudoyee say to him, Forty-and six years was this temple being built, and wilt thou in three days raise it?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.21'>But he spake of the temple of his body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.22'>But when he was risen from the house of the dead, his disciples remembered that this he had said; and they believed the scriptures, and the word which Jeshu had spoken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.23'>WHILE Jeshu was in Jerusalem at the petscha, at the feast, Many believed in him who saw the signs which he wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.24'>But he, Jeshu, did not confide himself to them, because he knew every man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.2.25'>and needed not that any should testify to him concerning any man, because he knew what is in man.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.3'>
        <verse osisID='John.3.1'>But there was one of the Pharishee whose name was Nikodimos, a ruler of the Jihudoyee:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.2'>this came to Jeshu in the night, and said to him, Rabi, we know that from Aloha thou art sent a teacher; for no man can these signs perform which thou doest, unless Aloha be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.3'>Jeshu answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, Except a man be born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.4'>Nikodimos said to him, How can an old man be born? Who can again the womb of his mother the second time enter, and be born?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.5'>Jeshu answered and said to him, Amen, amen, I say to thee, That if a man be not born of waters and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.6'>Whatever is born of the flesh, is flesh; and whatever is born of the Spirit, is spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.7'>Wonder not that I have said to thee, that it behoves you to be born anew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.8'>The wind bloweth where she willeth, and her voice thou hearest; but thou knowest not whence she cometh, nor whither she goeth: so is every man who is born of the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.9'>Nikodimos answered and said to him, How can these things be?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.10'>Jeshu answered and said to him, Art thou Malphona of Israel, and these knowest not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.11'>Amen, amen, I say to thee, What we know we speak, and what we have seen we testify; but our testimony you receive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.12'>If of (what is) on earth I tell you, and you believe not, how if I tell you of (what is) in heaven, could you believe me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.13'>AND no man hath ascended into heaven, but he who descended from heaven, the Son of man, he who is in heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.14'>And as Musha elevated the serpent in the wilderness, so is to be elevated the Son of man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.15'>that every man who believeth in him might not perish, but have the life which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.16'>For so loved Aloha the world, as his Son, the Only-begotten, he would give, that every one who believeth in him might not perish, but have the life which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.17'>For Aloha sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might live by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.18'>He who believeth on him is not judged, and he who believeth not is judged already, because he believeth not in the name of the only-begotten Son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.19'>And this is the judgment, that the light hath come into the world, and the sons of men have loved darkness rather than the light, for their deeds have been evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.20'>For every one who doeth abominable things hateth the light, and cometh not to the light, lest his deeds should be reproved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.21'>But he who doeth the truth cometh to the light, that his works may be known that in Aloha they are wrought.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.22'>AFTER these came Jeshu and his disciples into the land of Jihuda, and there conversed with them and baptized.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.23'>But Juchanon also was baptizing in Ein-yon, near Sholim, because the waters were there many; and they came and were baptized;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.24'>for not yet was Juchanon cast into the house of the bound.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.25'>But there was a question with some of the disciples of Juchanon (and) a certain Jihudoya, upon purification.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.26'>And they came to Juchanon, and said to him, Raban, he who was with thee at the passage of Jurdan, (and) concerning whom thou didst give witness, he also baptizeth, and many come to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.27'>Juchanon answered and said to them, A man cannot receive of his own will any thing, unless it be given to him from heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.28'>You bear me witness that I said, I am not the Meshicha, but I am an apostle before him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.29'>He that hath the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who standeth and attendeth him, with great joy rejoiceth on account of the voice of the bridegroom: this my joy therefore, behold, is complete.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.30'>To him it must be to increase, and to me to decrease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.31'>For he who from above hath come, is above all; and he who is from the earth, is of the earth, and of the earth speaketh: he who from heaven hath come, is above all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.32'>And what he hath seen and heard he testifieth, and his testimony no man receiveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.33'>But he who hath received his testimony, hath sealed that the true Aloha is he.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.34'>For he whom Aloha hath sent, the very words of Aloha speaketh; for it was not in measure that Aloha gave the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.35'>The Father loveth the Son, and every thing hath he given into his hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.3.36'>He who believeth in the Son hath the life which is eternal; and he who obeyeth not the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of Aloha remaineth on him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.4'>
        <verse osisID='John.4.1'>But when Jeshu knew that the Pharishee had heard that he had made many disciples, and baptized more than Juchanon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.2'>(though it was not Jeshu himself baptized, but his disciples,)</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.3'>he left Jihuda, and came again into Galila.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.4'>AND he needed that in going he should pass through among the Shomroyee;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.5'>and he came to a city of the Shomroyee which is called Shokar, nigh to the field which Jakub gave unto Jauseph his son.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.6'>And the fountain of water of Jakub was there. But Jeshu was wearied with the labour of the way, and sat by the fountain; and it was six hours.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.7'>There came a woman from Shomreen to draw waters, and Jeshu said to her, Give me waters to drink.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.8'>Now his disciples had gone into the city to buy for them meat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.9'>The woman, the Shomroytha, saith to him, How (canst) thou who art a Jihudoya ask drink of me who am a woman, a Shomroytha? For the Jihudoyee have no accommodation with the Shomroyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.10'>Jeshu answered and said to her, If thou hadst known the gift of Aloha, and who He is who hath said to thee, Give me to drink, thou wouldst have asked of him, and he had given thee living waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.11'>That woman saith to him, My Lord, thou hast no vessel, and the well is deep; whence hast thou living waters?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.12'>Art thou greater than our father Jakub, he who gave us this well, and himself drank of it, and his children, and his flocks?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.13'>Jeshu answered and said to her, Every one who shall drink of these waters again will thirst;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.14'>but every one who shall drink of the waters that I will give him shall never thirst; but those waters that I shall give him shall be in him a fountain of waters, that shall spring forth to the life of eternity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.15'>That woman saith to him, My Lord, give me of those waters, that I thirst not again, nor come to draw from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.16'>Jeshu saith to her, Go, call thy husband, and come hither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.17'>She saith to him, I have no husband. Jeshu saith to her, Well hast thou said, I have no husband;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.18'>for five husbands hast thou had, and this whom thou now hast is not thy husband; this hast thou said truly.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.19'>That woman saith to him, My Lord, I perceive that thou art a prophet.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.20'>Our fathers in this mountain worshipped, and you say that in Urishlem is the place where it behoves to worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.21'>Jeshu saith to her, Woman, believe me that the hour cometh when neither in this mountain, nor at Urishlem, you shall worship the Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.22'>you worship something you know not; but we worship whom we know; for salvation is from the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.23'>But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth; for the Father also requireth worshippers such as these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.24'>For Aloha is a Spirit; and they who worship him, in spirit and in truth must worship.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.25'>That woman saith to him, I know that the Meshicha cometh; and when he hath come, he will teach us all things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.26'>Jeshu saith to her, I am (he), I who speak with thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.27'>And as he spoke, his disciples came, and they wondered that with the woman he spoke; but no man said, What inquirest thou? or, Why speakest thou with her?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.28'>The woman left her water-pot, and went into the city, and saith,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.29'>Come, see a man who hath told me every thing that I have done: is not this the Meshicha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.30'>And the men went out of the city, and came with her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.31'>Between these things his disciples entreated of him, saying to him, Raban, eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.32'>But he said to them, I have food to eat of which you know not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.33'>The disciples say among themselves, Has any man brought him somewhat to eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.34'>Jeshu saith to them, My meat is to do the will of Him who sent me, and to accomplish his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.35'>Say you not, that after four moons cometh harvest? Behold, I tell you, Lift up your eyes, and see the lands which have become white for the harvest already.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.36'>And he who reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal; and the sower and the reaper shall rejoice together.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.37'>For in this is the proverb true, One soweth, and another reapeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.38'>I sent you to reap that (for) which you did not toil; for others toiled, and you have entered upon their labour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.39'>Now of that city many Shomroyee believed in him, because of the saying of that woman, who testified, He told me every thing that I have done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.40'>And when those Shomroyee came to him, they besought him to be with them. And he was with them two days,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.41'>and many believed through his word.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.42'>And they said to the woman, Now not through thy word believe we in him; for we have heard and known that this is truly the Meshicha, the Saviour of the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.43'>AND after two days Jeshu went forth from thence, and came into Galila;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.44'>for he himself testified, that a prophet in his own city is not honoured.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.45'>But when he came to Galila, the Galiloyee received him, because they had seen all the signs which he had done in Urishlem at the feast; for they also went to the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.46'>So Jeshu came again into Kotna of Galila, where he had made the waters wine. And there was at Kapher-nachum the servant of a certain king, whose son was ill.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.47'>This (man) heard that Jeshu had come from Jihuda into Galila; and he came to him, and besought him that he would come down and heal his son, for he was near to die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.48'>Jeshu saith to him, If signs and wonders you do not SEE, you will not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.49'>The servant of the king saith to him, My lord, come down ere my child die!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.50'>Jeshu saith to him, Go, thy son liveth. And the man believed in the word which Jeshu had spoken to him, and went.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.51'>But as he was going down, his servants met him, and gave him good news, saying to him, Thy son liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.52'>And he asked at what time he was healed. They say to him, Yesterday, at seven hours, the fever left him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.53'>And his father knew that in that hour it was in which Jeshu said to him, Thy son liveth; and he believed, and all his house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.4.54'>This is again the second sign (which) Jeshu did when he had come from Jihuda into Galila.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.5'>
        <verse osisID='John.5.1'>AFTER these there was a feast of the Jihudoyee, and Jeshu went up to Urishlem.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.2'>Now there was there in Urishlem a certain place of ablution, which was called in Hebrew Bethchesda, and having in it five porticoes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.3'>And in these were many infirm people, blind and lame and withered, awaiting the moving of the waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.4'>For an angel at times descended to the pool and moved the waters; and he who first descended after the movement of the waters was healed of whatever disease he had.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.5'>But a certain man was there who for thirtyand-eight years had been in a disease.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.6'>Jeshu saw this (man) as he lay, and knew that for a long time he had (been thus), and said to him, Art thou willing to be healed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.7'>The diseased man answered and said, Yes, my Lord; but I have no man who, when the waters are moved, shall cast me into the pool: but while I am coming, another before me descendeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.8'>Jeshu saith to him, Arise, take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.9'>And in the instant that man was healed, and, arising, he took up his bed, and walked: and that day was the shabath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.10'>And the Jihudoyee said to him who had been healed, This is the shabath: it is not lawful for thee to carry thy bed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.11'>But he answered and said to them, He who made me whole, he said to me, Take up thy bed, and walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.12'>And they said to him, What man is this who told thee to take up thy bed, and walk?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.13'>But he who had been healed knew not who it was; for Jeshu had retired among the great multitude which was in that place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.14'>After a time Jeshu found him in the temple, and said to him, Behold, thou art healed: sin not again, lest there be to thee that which is worse than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.15'>And that man went away, and told the Jihudoyee, that it was Jeshu who had healed him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.16'>On account of this the Jihudoyee persecuted Jeshu, and sought to kill him, because these things he had done on the shabath.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.17'>But he, Jeshu, said to them, My Father until now worketh, I also work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.18'>But on this account the more sought the Jihudoyee to kill him, not only because he had loosed the shabath, but also that of Aloha he had said that he was his Father, and had made himself equal with Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.19'>BUT Jeshu answered and said to them, Amen, amen, I say to you, The Son cannot do any thing from the will of himself, but that which he seeth the Father do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.20'>For those which the Father doeth, these also the Son likewise doeth. For the Father loveth the Son, and every thing that he doeth he showeth him; and greater than these works he showeth him, that you may wonder.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.21'>For as the Father raiseth the dead, and quickeneth, so also the Son quickeneth those whom he willeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.22'>For the Father judgeth no man, but all judgment he hath given to the Son;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.23'>that all men should honour the Son, as they honour the Father. He who honoureth not the Son, honoureth not the Father who sent him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.24'>Amen, amen, I say to you, He who heareth my word and believeth on him who sent me, hath the life that is eternal, and into condemnation he cometh not, but hath passed from death unto life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.25'>Amen, amen, I say to you, That the hour cometh and also now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of Aloha; and they who hear shall live</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.26'>For as the Father hath life in his person, so hath he given also to the Son to have life in his person,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.27'>and hath empowered him also to execute judgment. Because he is the Son of man,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.28'>marvel not at this; for the hour cometh when all they who are in the sepulchres shall hear his voice,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.29'>and shall come forth; they who have done good unto the resurrection of life, and they who have done evil unto the resurrection of condemnation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.30'>I CANNOT of the will of myself do any thing; but as I hear I judge, and my judgment is just; for I seek not my will, but the will of Him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.31'>If I should witness concerning myself, my testimony would not be (regarded as) truth:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.32'>there is another who witnesseth of me, and I know that true is his testimony which he hath witnessed of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.33'>You sent to Juchanon, and he witnessed of the truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.34'>But I do not from man (only) receive testimony. But these (things) speak I that you may be saved.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.35'>He was a lamp that burneth and shineth, and you were willing to glory for the hour in his light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.36'>But I have a testimony which is greater than that of Juchanon; for the works that the Father hath given me to accomplish, these works that I do testify of me that the Father hath sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.37'>And the Father who hath sent me, he testifieth of me: but his voice you have never heard, nor his appearance seen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.38'>And his word abideth not in you, because in Him whom he hath sent you do not believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.39'>Investigate the scriptures; for in them you think you have the life that is eternal, and they testify of me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.40'>And you will not come to me that the life that is eternal you might have.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.41'>Glory from the sons of men I receive not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.42'>But I know you, that the love of Aloha is not in you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.43'>I have come in the name of my Father, and you have not received me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.44'>If another should come in his own name, him you would receive. How can you believe, who glory one from another are receiving, and the glory which is from one, Aloha, you seek not?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.45'>How think you that I will accuse you before the Father? There is one who accuseth you, Musha himself, in whom you hope.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.46'>For if in Musha you had believed, you would also have believed in me; for Musha of me hath written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.5.47'>But if his writings you believe not, how my words will you believe?</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.6.1'>AFTER these Jeshu went over the Sea of Galila of Tiberios,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.2'>and great multitudes went after him, because they had seen the signs which he wrought on the diseased.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.3'>And Jeshu ascended a mountain, and there sat with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.4'>Now the feast of the petscha of the Jihudoyee drew nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.5'>And Jeshu lifted up his eyes, and saw the great assembly which had come to him; and he said to Philipos, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.6'>But this he said trying him; for he knew what he was about to do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.7'>Philipos saith to him, Two hundred dinoreen of bread is not sufficient for them, that a little every one of them may take.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.8'>Saith to him one of his disciples, Andreas, brother of Shemun Kipha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.9'>There is here a certain youth, who hath with him five cakes of barley and two fishes; but these what are they for these all?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.10'>Jeshu saith to them, Make all the men recline; for there was much herbage in that place. And the men reclined, in number five thousand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.11'>And Jeshu took the bread, and blessed, and divided unto those who reclined, and likewise also of the fishes, as much as they willed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.12'>And when they were satisfied, he said to his disciples, Gather the fragments that abound, that nothing be lost;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.13'>and they gathered and filled twelve baskets of fragments, those which abounded unto them who had eaten of the five loaves of barley.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.14'>But those men, when they had seen the sign which Jeshu had wrought, said, Truly this is the Prophet that cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.15'>But when Jeshu knew that they were about to come to seize him and make him the King, he passed away to a mountain alone.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.16'>AND when it was eventide, his disciples went down to the sea.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.17'>And they sat in a vessel, and went over for Kapher-nachum. And it was dark, and Jeshu had not come to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.18'>But the sea had risen against them, because a great wind blew.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.19'>And they had led stadia twentyfive or thirty, and they saw Jeshu walking upon the sea, and drawing nigh to the vessel; and they feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.20'>But Jeshu himself said to them, I am, fear not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.21'>And they willed to receive him into the vessel, and soon that vessel was at that land to which they were going.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.22'>The day after the people that stood on the opposite shore of the sea saw that there was not another vessel there except that into which the disciples had ascended, and that Jeshu had not entered with his disciples into the vessel;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.23'>but there came other boats from Tiberios near the place, where they did eat bread when Jeshu had blessed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.24'>And when that company saw that Jeshu was not there nor his disciples, they ascended into those boats, and came to Kapher-nachum. And they sought Jeshu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.25'>and when they had found him on the opposite side of the sea, they say to him, Raban, when camest thou hither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.26'>Jeshu answered and said to them, Amen, amen, I tell you, You seek me, not because you considered the signs, but because you did eat the bread, and were satisfied.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.27'>Work not (for) the food which perisheth, but (for) the food that endureth unto the life that is eternal, which the Son of man shall give to you: for this hath the Father sealed, (even) Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.28'>They say to him, What shall we do that we may work the works of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.29'>Jeshu answered and said to them, This is the work of Aloha, that you believe in Him whom he hath sent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.30'>THEY say to him, What sign doest thou that we may see, and believe in thee? What performest thou?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.31'>Our fathers manna did eat in the desert, as it is written, that bread from heaven be gave them to eat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.32'>Jeshu saith to them, Amen, amen, I tell you, That Musha gave you not that bread from heaven, but my Father giveth you the true bread from heaven:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.6.33'>for the bread of Aloha is He who hath descended from heaven, and giveth life to the world.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.10.35'>If them he calleth Alohee, because with them was the word of Aloha, and the scripture cannot be loosed,</verse>

      <chapter osisID='John.11'>
        <verse osisID='John.11.1'>BUT a certain man was sick, Loozar, of the village Bethania: (he was) the brother of Mariam and of Martha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.2'>It was that Mariam who anointed with balsam the feet of Jeshu, and wiped (them) with her hair, whose brother this Loozar was who was sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.3'>And his two sisters sent unto Jeshu, saying, Our Lord, he whom thou lovest is sick.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.4'>But Jeshu said, This sickness is not of death, but for the glory of Aloha, that the Son of Aloha may be glorified on account of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.5'>But Jeshu loved Martha and Mariam and Loozar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.6'>And when he heard that he was sick, he remained in the place where he was two days.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.7'>And afterwards he saith to his disciples, Come, we will go again into Jihud.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.8'>His disciples say to him, Raban, now have the Jihudoyee sought to stone thee; and again goest thou thither?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.9'>Jeshu saith to them, Are there not twelve hours in the day? If a man walk in the day, he stumbleth not, because he seeth the light of this world;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.10'>but if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because no light is in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.11'>These spake Jeshu; and afterwards he said to them, Loozar our friend reposeth; but I go to awake him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.12'>His disciples say to him, Our Lord, if he sleep he is healed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.13'>But Jeshu spake concerning his death; and they thought that concerning the repose of sleep he spake.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.14'>Then said Jeshu to them explicatively, Loozar is dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.15'>And I am glad I was not there for your sakes, that you may believe. But let us walk thither.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.16'>Thoma, who is called the Twin, saith to his fellow-disciples, Let us also go, that we may die with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.17'>And Jeshu came to Bethania, and found that he had been four days in the house of burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.18'>Now Bethania was nigh to Urishlem, being a distance from it of about fifteen stadia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.19'>And many of the Jihudoyee had come to Martha and Mariam, that they might speak to their hearts concerning their brother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.20'>Then Martha, when she heard that Jeshu had come, went forth to meet him; but Mariam sat in the house.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.21'>And Martha said to Jeshu, My Lord, if thou hadst been here, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.22'>But even now know I that whatsoever thou wilt ask of Aloha, he giveth to thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.23'>Jeshu saith to her, Thy brother ariseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.24'>Martha saith to him, I know that he ariseth in the resurrection at the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.25'>Jeshu saith to her, I am the Resurrection and the Life; and (he) who believeth in me, although he will die, shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.26'>And every one who liveth and believeth in me, for ever shall not die. Believest thou this?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.27'>She saith to him, Yes, my Lord; I believe that thou art the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha, who cometh into the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.28'>And when she had said these, she went, called Mariam her sister in secret, and said to her, Our Master hath come, and calleth for thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.29'>When Mariam heard, she arose quickly, and came to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.30'>But Jeshu himself had not yet come into the village, but was in that place where Martha met him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.31'>But those Jihudoyee who were also with her in the house to console her, when they saw that Mariam rose up hastily to go forth, went themselves after her; for they thought that to the sepulchre she went to weep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.32'>But she, Mariam, when she was come where Jeshu was, and saw him, fell down at his feet, saying, If thou hadst been here, my Lord, my brother had not died.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.33'>But Jeshu, when he saw her weeping, and those Jihudoyee who came with her weeping, he was moved in his spirit, and was troubled,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.34'>and said, Where have you laid him? And they said to him, Our Lord, come and see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.35'>And the tears of Jeshu came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.36'>And the Jihudoyee said, See how he loved him!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.37'>But some of them said, Could not this who opened the eyes of that blind have caused also that this should not have died?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.38'>Jeshu, groaning within himself, came to the house of burial; and that house of burial was a cave, and a stone was laid at the gate of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.39'>And Jeshu said, Take up this stone. Martha, the sister of him (who was) dead, saith to him, My Lord, he now stinketh; for four days are to him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.40'>Jeshu said to her, Said I not to thee, that if thou wilt believe, thou shalt see the glory of Aloha?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.41'>And they took up the stone. And Jeshu lifted his eye upward, and said, Father, I give thanks to thee that thou hast heard me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.42'>and I know that at all times thou hearest me: yet, because of this assembly which standeth, I say these (words), that they may believe that thou hast sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.43'>And when he had said these (words), he cried with a high voice, Loozar, come without!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.44'>And he, the dead, came forth, his hands and his feet being bound with bandages, and his face in a linen cloth. Jeshu saith to them, Release him, and let (him) go.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.45'>And many of the Jihudoyee who came with Mariam, when they saw the thing which Jeshu did, believed on him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.46'>And some of them went to the Pharishee, and told them every thing that Jeshu had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.47'>AND the chief priests and Pharishee assembled, and said, What shall we do? because this man doeth many signs;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.48'>and if we leave him thus, all men will believe on him, and the Rumoyee, coming, take away our country and our people.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.49'>But one of them, whose name was Kaiapha, was the high priest of that year; and he said to them, You know not any thing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.50'>nor reason that it is expedient for us that one man die for the people, and not all the people perish.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.51'>But this from himself he spake not, but because he was high priest of that year, he prophesied that Jeshu should die for the people,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.52'>and not only for (that) people, but also that the children of Aloha who are dispersed he should gather into one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.53'>And from that day they determined to kill him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.54'>But Jeshu himself walked not openly among the Jihudoyee, but went from thence to the region near the wilderness, to a region which was called Ephrem, and there conversed with his disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.55'>NOW the petscha of the Jihudoyee drew nigh; and many went up from the country places to Urishlem before the festival, to purify themselves.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.56'>And they sought for Jeshu, and said one to another in the temple, What think you, that he cometh to the feast?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.11.57'>But the chief priests and Pharishee had commanded that if any man knew where (he was), he should declare it to them, as that they might apprehend him.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.12'>
        <verse osisID='John.12.1'>But Jeshu six days before the petscha came to Bethania, where Loozar was, he whom Jeshu had raised from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.2'>And they made him there a supper and Martha served, and Loozar was one of those who reclined with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.3'>But Mariam took a vase of balsam of the finest nard, great in price, and anointed the feet of Jeshu, and wiped with her hair his feet, and the house was filled with the fragrance of the balsam.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.4'>And Jihuda Scarjuta, one of his disciples, he who would betray him said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.5'>Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred dinoreen, and given to the poor?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.6'>But this he said, not because for the poor he had care, but because he was a thief, and the purse was with him, and whatever fell into it he carried.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.7'>But Jeshu said, Let her alone. For the day of my burial had she kept it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.8'>In all time the poor you have with you; but me you have not at all time.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.9'>And a great company of Jihudoyee who were there heard Jeshu. And they had come not on Jeshu's account only, but also to see Loozar, he whom he had raised from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.10'>But the chief priests were minded to slay Loozar also,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.11'>because many of the Jihudoyee on account of him had gone and believed in Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.12'>THE day after, a great gathering of those who had come to the feast, when they heard that Jeshu was coming to Urishlem,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.13'>took branches of palms, and went forth to meet him. And they cried out, saying, Aushana! Blessed is he who cometh in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.14'>And Jeshu caused to be found an ass, and sat upon him; as it is written,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.15'>Fear not, daughter of Tseun: behold, thy King cometh to thee, and riding on a colt, the foal of an ass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.16'>But these the disciples knew not at that time; but when Jeshu was glorified, the disciples remembered that these were written concerning him, and (that) these (things) they had done unto him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.17'>But the assembly that was with him when he called Loozar from the sepulchre, and raised him from among the dead, bare witness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.18'>And on account of this, great multitudes went forth to receive him; for they had heard that this sign he had done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.19'>But the Pharishee said one to another, See you that you do not profit any thing! For, behold, the whole world is gone after him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.20'>Now there were also from the Gentiles men who had ascended to worship at the feast.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.21'>These came and drew near to Philipos, who was of Beth-tsaida of Galila; and they requested of him, and said to him, Mari, we desire to see Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.22'>And Philipos came and told Andreas, and Andreas and Philipos told Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.23'>BUT Jeshu answered and said to them, The hour hath come that the Son of man may be glorified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.24'>Amen, amen, I say to you, That a grain of wheat if it fall not and die in the earth remaineth alone; but if it die, it bringeth much fruits.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.25'>He who loveth his life shall lose it; and he who hateth his life in this world shall keep it to the life which is eternal.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.26'>If any man serve me, let him come after me; and where I am, there shall be also my servant: whoever serveth me, him will my Father honour.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.27'>Now my soul, behold it is commoved; and what shall I say? My Father, deliver me from this hour:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.28'>but on account of this have I come unto this hour. Father, glorify thy name. And the voice was heard from heaven, I have glorified, and again I glorify.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.29'>And the company who stood, heard, and they said there was thunder. But others said, An angel spake with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.30'>Jeshu answered and said to them, Not on my account was this voice, but on your account.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.31'>Now is the judgment of this world; now is the ruler of this world cast out.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.32'>And I, when I have been lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.33'>But this he said to show by what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.34'>The people said to him, We have heard from the law that the Meshicha for ever abideth: how sayest thou that the Son of man is to be lifted up? Who is this Son of man?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.35'>Jeshu saith to them, A little further time is the light with you. Walk while you have the light, that the darkness overtake you not. And whoever walketh in darkness knoweth not whither he goeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.36'>While you have the light, believe in the light, that the sons of light you may become. These spake Jeshu, and went (and) concealed himself from them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.37'>Yet though all these signs he had done before them, they believed not in him:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.38'>that the word of the prophet Eshaia might be fulfilled, who said, My Lord, who hath believed our report, And the arm of the Lord, to whom hath it been revealed?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.39'>Because of this they were not able to believe: Wherefore again Eshaia had said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.40'>He hath blinded their eyes, And darkened their heart, That they should not see with their eyes, And understand with their heart, And be turned, and I should heal them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.41'>These said Eshaia when he saw his glory, and spake concerning him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.42'>Yet of the chiefs also many believed in him: but because of the Pharishee they did not confess, that they might not be put out of the synagogue:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.43'>for they loved the glory of men more than the glory of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.44'>But Jeshu cried and said, He who believeth in me, believeth not in me, but in him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.45'>And he who seeth me seeth him who sent me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.46'>I the light am come into the world, that every one who believeth in me might not abide in darkness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.47'>And he who heareth my words, and doth not keep them, I judge him not: for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.48'>He who rejecteth me, and receiveth not my word, hath that which judgeth him: the word which I speak, that judgeth him in the last day.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.49'>For I of myself have not spoken, but the Father who sent me, he gave me a commandment, what I should say, and what I should speak.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.12.50'>And I know that his commandments are life everlasting: these therefore which I speak, as said to me my Father, so I speak.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.13.1'>NOW before the feast of petscha, Jeshu knew that his hour was come, and that he should pass from this world unto his Father, and he had loved his who were in this world, and unto the end he had loved them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.13.2'>And when was the supper, Satana had cast it into the heart of Jihuda bar Shemun Scarjuta to betray him.</verse>

        <verse osisID='John.18.32'>The Jihudoyee say to him, It is not lawful for us to put any one to death. That the word that Jeshu spake might be accomplished, when he declared by what death he should die.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.33'>But Pilatos entered the Praetorium, and called Jeshu, and said to him, Art thou the king of the Jihudoyee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.34'>Jeshu saith to him, Of thyself sayest thou this, or did others tell thee concerning me?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.35'>Pilatos saith to him, Am I a Jihudoya? The sons of thy people and the chief priests have delivered thee to me: what hast thou done?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.36'>Jeshu saith to him, My kingdom is not from this world. If from this world were my kingdom, my servants would have fought, that I should not have been delivered to the Jihudoyee. But now my kingdom is not from hence.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.37'>Pilatos saith to him, Then thou art a king? Jeshu saith to him, Thou hast said that I am a king. For this am I born, and for this I came into the world, to testify of the truth. Every one who is of the truth heareth my voice.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.38'>Pilatos said to him, What is the truth? And when he had said this, he went forth again to the Jihudoyee, and said to them, I find not one cause in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.39'>But you have a custom that one I should release to you at the petscha. Will you, therefore, that I release to you this King of the Jihudoyee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.18.40'>And they all cried and said, Not this, but Bar Aba. Now this Bar Aba was a robber.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.19'>
        <verse osisID='John.19.1'>Then Pilatos scourged Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.2'>And the soldiers entwined a crown of thorns, and set it on his head; and they covered him with robes of purple,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.3'>and said, Hail to thee, King of the Jihudoyee! and struck him upon his cheeks.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.4'>And Pilatos came again forth, and said to them, Behold, I bring him to you forth, that you may know that I find nothing against him, nor one cause (of death).</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.5'>AND Jeshu came forth, having on him the crown of thorns and the robes of purple. And Pilatos said to them, Behold the man!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.6'>But when the chief priests and officials saw him, they cried out, saying, Crucify him, crucify him! Pilatos saith to them, Take you him and crucify him; for I find in him no cause.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.7'>The Jihudoyee say to him, We have a law, and, according to our law, he is guilty of death, because he made himself the son of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.8'>When Pilatos heard that word, he the more feared.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.9'>And he entered again the praetorium, and said to Jeshu, Whence art thou? But Jeshu gave him no answer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.10'>Pilatos saith to him, With me speakest thou not? Knowest thou not that I have power to release thee, and power to crucify thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.11'>Jeshu saith to him, Thou against ME hast no power, no not any, unless it hath been given to thee from above: wherefore he who delivered me to thee hath a sin greater than thine.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.12'>On this account Pilatos willed to release him: but the Jihudoyee cried out, If this (man) thou releasest, thou art not the friend of Cesar: for whosoever maketh himself a king is the adversary of Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.13'>But when Pilatos heard that word, he brought Jeshu without, and sat down upon the tribunal in the place which is called the Pavement of Stones, but in Hebrew it is called Gaphiphtha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.14'>And it was the preparation for the petscha. AND it was about the sixth hour. And he said to the Jihudoyee, Behold your king!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.15'>But they cried out, Take him away, take him away! crucify him, crucify him! Pilatos saith to them, Your king shall I crucify? The chief priests say to him, We have no king but Cesar.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.16'>Then delivered he him to them, that they might crucify him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.17'>And they took Jeshu, and led him forth, bearing his cross to a place which is called A Skull, but in Hebrew is Gogultha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.18'>there they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either side, and Jeshu in the midst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.19'>And a tablet also wrote Pilatos, and set it on the cross; and it was thus written, This is Jeshu Natsroya, King of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.20'>And this title many of the Jihudoyee read; for nigh to the city was the place where Jeshu was crucified; and the writing was in Hebrew and Greek and Roman.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.21'>And the chief priests said to Pilatos, Do not write that he is king of the Jihudoyee, but that he said, I am the king of the Jihudoyee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.22'>Pilatos saith, That which I have written, I have written.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.23'>BUT the soldiers, when they had crucified Jeshu, took his vestments and made four parts, a part unto each one of the soldiers: but his tunic was without seam, from the top woven all of it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.24'>And they said one to another, Let us not rend it, but play for it by playing, (to decide) whose it shall be: and fulfilled was the scripture which had said,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.25'>They divided my garments among them, And upon my raiment did they cast the lot. These things did the soldiers. But there stood by the cross of Jeshu his mother, and the sister of his mother, and Mariam, she who was (the wife) of Cleopha, and Mariam Magdalitha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.26'>Jeshu seeth his mother, and that disciple whom he loved, standing; and he said to his mother, Woman, behold thy son!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.27'>and he said to that disciple, Behold thy mother! And from that hour that disciple received her to be with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.28'>After these Jeshu knew that every thing would be accomplished, and, that the scripture might be fulfilled, said, I thirst.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.29'>And a vessel was set (there) filled with vinegar: then they filled a sponge from the vinegar, and put it upon hyssop, and offered it to his mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.30'>And when Jeshu had taken the vinegar, he said, Behold, it is finished! And he bowed his head, and delivered up his spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.31'>THE Jihudoyee, because it was the preparation, said, Let not these bodies remain-all-night upon the cross, because the shabath has lighted: for a great day was the day of that shabath. And they besought of Pilatos that they should break the legs of those (who had been) crucified, and take them down.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.32'>And the soldiers came, and brake the legs of the first, and of that other who was crucified with him;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.33'>but when they came unto Jeshu, they saw that he was dead already, and they brake not his legs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.34'>But one of the soldiers struck him in his side with the lance, and forthwith there came out blood and water.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.35'>And he who SAW testifieth, and the truth is his testimony; and he knoweth that the truth he hath said, that you also may believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.36'>For these things were done, that the scripture might be fulfilled, which said, that A bone shall not be broken in him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.37'>And again another scripture which said, They shall look upon him whom they pierced.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.38'>After these Jauseph, he who was of Rometha, begged of Pilatos, for he was a disciple of Jeshu, but secretly for fear of the Jihudoyee, that he might take the body of Jeshu: and Pilatos permitted. And he came and took the body of Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.39'>And Nikodimos also came, he who at first had come to Jeshu by night, and he brought with him a condiment of myrrh and aloes, as a hundred lithreen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.40'>And they took the body of Jeshu, and wrapped it in cloths and in balsams, as is the manner of the Jihudoyee to bury.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.41'>Now in that place where Jeshu was crucified was a garden, and in the garden a new sepulchre where one yet had not been laid.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.19.42'>And they laid there Jeshu, because the shabath was coming in and the sepulchre was near.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.20'>
        <verse osisID='John.20.1'>BUT in the first in the week came Mariam Magdalitha in the early-morn, (while it was) yet dark, unto the house of burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.2'>And she saw the stone that it was taken from the sepulchre. And she ran, and came to Shemun Kipha, and to that other disciple, whom Jeshu loved, saying to them, They have taken away our Lord from that house of burial, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.3'>And Shemun went forth, and that other disciple, and they came to the house of burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.4'>And they ran both of them together; but that disciple ran before Shemun, and came first to the house of burial.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.5'>And looking, he saw the cloths lying, but entering he entered not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.6'>But Shemun came after him, and went into the house of burial, and saw the cloths set,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.7'>and the napkin that had been bound upon his head, not with the cloths, but folded up, and laid apart in one place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.8'>Then went in also that disciple who came first to the house of burial, and he saw, and believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.9'>For not yet knew they the scriptures, that he was to rise from the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.10'>And those disciples went again to their place.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.11'>But Mariam stood at the sepulchre weeping: and while weeping, she looked into the sepulchre,</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.12'>and saw two angels in white, who were sitting, one at his pillows, and one at his feet, where the body of Jeshu had lain.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.13'>And they say to her, Woman, why weepest thou? She saith to them, Because they have taken away my Lord, and I know not where they have laid him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.14'>This said she, and turned herself back, and saw Jeshu standing, and knew not that it was Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.15'>Jeshu saith to her, Woman, why weepest thou? and whom seekest thou? But she thought he was the gardener, and said to him, Sir, if thou have taken him away, tell me where thou hast laid him, and I will go (and) take him away.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.16'>Jeshu saith to her, Mariam. She turned and saith to him in Hebrew, Rabuni, which is saying, Malphona.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.17'>Jeshu saith to her, Touch me not; for not yet have I ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say to them, I ascend to my Father, and to your Father, to my God, and to your God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.18'>Then went Mariam Magdalitha, and announced to the disciples that she had seen our Lord, and (that) these (words) he had spoken to her.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.19'>WHEN it was the evening of that day which (was) the first in the week, and the doors were shut where the disciples were, for fear of the Jihudoyee, came Jeshu, stood among them, and said to them, Peace (be) with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.20'>This he said, and showed them his hands and his side. And the disciples rejoiced when they saw our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.21'>Then said Jeshu unto them, Peace (be) with you: as my Father sent me, I also send you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.22'>And when he had said these, he breathed on them, and said to them, Receive the Spirit of Holiness:</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.23'>if you forgive sins to a man, they shall be forgiven to him; and if you retain (the sins) of a man, they are retained.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.24'>But Thoma, one of the twelve, he who was called the Twin, was not there with them when Jeshu came.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.25'>And the disciples say to him, We have seen our Lord. But he said to them, Unless I see in his hands the places of the nails, and put into them my fingers, and extend my hand into his side, I believe not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.26'>AND after eight days again within were the disciples, and Thoma with them. And Jeshu came, while the doors were shut, stood in the midst, and said to them, Peace (be) with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.27'>And he said to Thoma, Bring thy finger hither and see my hands, and bring thy hand and thrust it into my side, and be not unbelieving but believing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.28'>And Thoma answered and said to him, My Lord, and my God!</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.29'>Jeshu saith to him, Now that thou hast seen, thou hast believed: blessed are they who have not seen me, and have believed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.30'>But many other signs did Jeshu before his disciples: those are not written in this record;</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.20.31'>but these are written, that you may believe that Jeshu is the Meshicha, the Son of Aloha, and that when you have believed you may have in his name the life which is eternal.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='John.21'>
        <verse osisID='John.21.1'>AFTER these Jeshu again showed himself to his disciples at the sea of Tiberios; and he showed (himself) thus.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.2'>There were together Shemun Kipha, and Thoma who was called the Twin, and Nathanael, he who was of Kotna of Galila, and the sons of Zabdai, and two other of the disciples.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.3'>Shemun Kipha saith to them, I go to net fishes. They say to him, We also go with thee. And they went forth and ascended into a vessel; and through that night they netted nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.4'>But when it was morning Jeshu stood on the sea shore; but the disciples knew not that it was Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.5'>And Jeshu said to them, Children, have you any thing to eat? They say to him, No.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.6'>He saith to them, Cast your net on the right side of the vessel, and you shall find. And they cast (it), and could not draw the net for the multitude of fishes which it held.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.7'>And that disciple whom Jeshu loved said to Kipha, This is our Lord. But Shemun, when he heard that it was our Lord, took his tunic, and threw it over his loins, for he was naked, and cast himself into the sea to come to Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.8'>But the other disciples came in the vessel, for they were not far from the land, but as two hundred ameen, and they drew that net of fishes.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.9'>Then when they had ascended the land, they saw coals laid, and fish laid upon them, and bread.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.10'>And Jeshu said, Bring of the fish which you have now caught.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.11'>And Shemun Kipha went up, and drew the net to land full of great fishes, an hundred and fifty and three: yet for all this weight that net was not broken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.12'>And Jeshu said to them, Come, dine. But one of the disciples did not dare to ask him, Who is he? for they knew that it was our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.13'>And Jeshu drew near, and took bread, and fish, and gave to them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.14'>This is the third time that Jeshu was seen by his disciples when he had risen from among the dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.15'>WHEN they had dined, Jeshu said to Shemun Kipha, Shemun bar Jona, lovest thou me more than these? He saith to him, Yes, my Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. Jeshu saith to him, Feed my lambs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.16'>He saith to him again the second time, Shemun bar Jona, lovest thou me? He saith to him, Yes, my Lord, thou knowest that I love thee. Jeshu saith to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.17'>Jeshu saith to him again the third time, Shemun bar Jona, lovest thou me? And it grieved Kipha that he said to him the third time, Lovest thou me? And he said to him, My Lord, all things thou understandest, thou knowest that I love thee. Jeshu saith to him, Feed my sheep.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.18'>Amen, I say to thee, When thou wast young, thou didst gird thy loins and walk whithersoever thou willedst; but when thou art old, thou shalt stretch forth thy hands, and another will bind thy loins, and conduct thee whither thou willest not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.19'>But this he said, to show by what death he was to glorify Aloha. And when he had said these, he said to him, Come after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.20'>AND Shemun turned, and saw the disciple whom Jeshu loved following; he, who leaned at the supper upon the bosom of Jeshu, and said, My Lord, who is he that betrayeth thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.21'>This when Kipha saw, he said to Jeshu, My Lord, and this, what?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.22'>Jeshu saith to him, If I will that this wait until I come, what (is that) to thee? Come thou after me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.23'>And that word went forth among the brethren, that that disciple dieth not. But Jeshu did not say, He dieth not, but, If I will that this (man) wait until I come, what (is that) to thee?</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.24'>This is the disciple who hath testified of all these, and hath also written them: and we know that the truth is his testimony.</verse>
        <verse osisID='John.21.25'>There are also many other things which Jeshu hath done, those that if one by one they were written, not the world also itself, as I think, would suffice for the books that could be written.</verse>
