        <verse osisID='Rev.1.1'>THE Revelation of Jeshu Meshiha, which Aloha gave unto him, to show unto his servants the things which must be done speedily; and which he made known, sending by his angel unto his servant Juhanon,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.2'>who attested the word of Aloha and the testimony of Jeshu Meshiha, and all which he beheld.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.3'>Blessed is he who readeth, and they who hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those which are written therein; for the time hath approached.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.4'>Juhanon to the seven churches which are in Asia: grace to you and peace from him who is, and who was, and who cometh; from the seven Spirits who are before his throne;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.5'>and from Jeshu Meshiha who is the faithful Witness, the First-born of the dead, and Head of the kings of the earth, who hath loved us, and released us from our sins by his blood,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.6'>and hath made us a priestly kingdom unto Aloha and his Father; to whom be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.7'>Behold, he cometh with clouds, and all eyes shall see him, and they also who transfixed him; and for him shall mourn all the tribes of the earth. Yes, Amen!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.8'>I am Olaph and Thau, saith Aloha the Lord, who is, and who was, and who cometh, the Omnipotent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.9'>I, Juhanon your brother, and your fellow-sharer in the affliction, and in the patience, which are in Jeshu Meshiha, was in the island which is called Pathamon, for the word of Aloha and for the testimony of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.10'>I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day; and I heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.11'>What thou seest, write in a book; and send to the seven churches, at Ephesos, and at Smurna, and at Pergamos, and at Thiatira, and at Sardis, and at Philidaphia, and at Laodikia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.12'>And I turned to see the voice that spake with me; and being turned, I saw seven candlesticks of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.13'>And in the midst of the candlesticks (one) who was like the Son of man, clothed to the foot, and girded about his paps with a circlet of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.14'>But his head and hair were white as wool, white as snow; and his eyes (were) as a flame of fire,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.15'>and his feet were like refined brass, which flamed as in a furnace, and his voice as the voice of many waters.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.16'>And he had in his right hand seven stars; and from his mouth a sharp sword of two edges went forth; and his countenance was as the sun shining in his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.17'>And when I saw him I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid upon me his right hand, saying, Fear not: I am the First and the Last;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.18'>and who liveth and who have been dead; and, behold, I am alive for ever and ever. Amen! And I have the keys of death and of Sheul.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.19'>Write, then, what thou hast seen; and those which are, and those which are to be after them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.1.20'>(This is) the mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right hand, and of the seven candlesticks of gold: the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven candlesticks are the seven churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.2'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.1'>To the angel of the church which is in Ephesos, write: These saith the Holder of all, and of the seven stars in his right hand, who walketh in the midst of the seven candlesticks of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.2'>I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and (that) thou canst not bear evils; and hast tried those who say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.3'>And thou hast patience, and hast laboured on account of my name, and hast not fainted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.4'>But I have against thee, because thy first love thou hast forsaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.5'>Remember, therefore, from whence thou art fallen, and repent, and do the first works. But if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will remove thy candlestick from its place, if thou convert not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.6'>But this thou hast, that thou hatest the works of the Nikolitu, which also I (hate).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.7'>He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches. To him who overcometh I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.8'>And to the angel of the church which is in Smurna, write: These saith the First and the Last, who was dead, and liveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.9'>I know thy works, and affliction, and poverty, but thou art rich; and the blasphemy of them who say of themselves that they are Jihudoyee, and are not, but the synagogue of Satana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.10'>Fear not any thing of those that thou art to suffer; for, behold, it will be that the accuser will cast some of you into prison, so that you may be tried; and you will have affliction ten days. Be faithful unto the death, and I will give thee the crown of life.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.11'>He who hath ears, let him hear what saith the Spirit to the churches. He who overcometh shall not be injured by the second death.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.12'>And to the angel of the church which is in Pergamos, write: These saith he who hath the sharp sword with two edges.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.13'>I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, where (is) the throne of Satana; and thou hast held my name, and not denied my faith in those days when my witness was exposed, my faithful one, who was killed with you where dwelleth Satana.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.14'>But I have against thee a little, because thou hast there those who hold the doctrine of Belam, who taught Balok to cast a stumbling-block before the sons of Israel, to eat that which the sons of idols (eat), and to commit fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.15'>So hast thou who hold the doctrine of the Nikolitu: of it,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.16'>in like (manner), repent; and if not, I will come to thee quickly, and will war against them with the sword of my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.17'>He who hath ears, let him hear what saith the Spirit to the churches. To him who overcometh will I give to eat of the manna which is hidden; and I will give to him the white stone, and upon the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth but he who receiveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.18'>And to the angel and church which is in Thiatiros, write: These saith the Son of Aloha, who hath his eyes as the flame of fire, and his feet like refined brass.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.19'>I know thy works, and thy love and faith and service; and also thy patience, and thy last works to be greater than the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.20'>But I have against thee that thou permittest thy wife Izabel, who calleth herself a prophetess, to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication, and to eat what the sons of idols (eat).</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.21'>And I gave her time when she might convert, and she willed not to repent of her fornication.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.22'>Behold, I cast her into a bed, and those who have committed adultery with her into great affliction, if they repent not of their works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.23'>And her sons will I kill with death, and all the churches shall know that I am he who searcheth the reins and the hearts: and I will give to you every one according to your works.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.24'>But to you I say, to those of the rest who are in Thiatiros, all them who have not this doctrine, the men who know not the depths Of Satana, as they speak; I will not throw upon you another burden;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.25'>but that which you have, hold, until I come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.26'>And he who conquereth, and he who keepeth until the end my works, I will give to him power over the peoples,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.27'>and he shall rule them with a rod of iron, and as a vessel of the potter shall they be destroyed, as also I have received from my Father;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.28'>and I will give to him the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.2.29'>He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.3'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.1'>AND to the angel who is in Sardis write: These saith he who hath the seven Spirits of Aloha, and the seven stars: I know thy works, that a name thou hast that thou livest, and thou art dead.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.2'>Awake, and keep those things which remain, which are about to die; for I have not found thy works complete before my God.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.3'>Remember then how thou hast received, and hearken, and keep, and repent. And if then thou wilt not awake, I will come against thee as the thief, and thou shalt not know in what hour I come against thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.4'>But thou hast a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their vestments; and they shall walk with me in white, because they are worthy.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.5'>He who overcometh shall be clothed in white vestments, and I will not blot their name from the book of life; and I will confess their name before my Father, and before his angels.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.6'>He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.7'>And to the angel of the church which is in Philadelphia write: These saith the Holy, the True, who hath the key of David; who openeth and no man shutteth, and who shutteth and no man openeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.8'>I know thy works; and, behold, I have given before thee an open door, which no man can shut; because thou hast a little strength, and hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.9'>Behold, I will give of the synagogue of Satana, who say that they are Jihudoyee, and are not, but lie; behold, I will make them to come and worship before thy feet, and they shall know that I have loved thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.10'>Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I will keep thee from the hour of temptation, which is to come upon all the habitable world, to try them who dwell upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.11'>I come quickly. Hold that which thou hast, that no man take thy crown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.12'>Him who overcometh I will make a column in the temple of my God, and he shall go out no more; and I will write upon him the name of my God, and of Urishlem the new, which descendeth from heaven from my God, and my new name.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.13'>He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.14'>And to the angel of the church which is in Ladikia write: These saith the Amen, the Witness, the faithful, the true, the Head of the creation of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.15'>I know thy works, that thou art neither hot nor cold. Would that thou wast cold or hot!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.16'>So, because thou art lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will vomit thee from my mouth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.17'>Because thou sayest, I am rich, and have become opulent, and of nothing have need; and knowest not that thou art infirm, and miserable, and needy, and blind, and naked;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.18'>I counsel thee to buy of me gold, proved by fire, that thou mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and the shame of thy nakedness be not seen; and lave with collyrium thine eyes, that thou mayest see.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.19'>All those whom I love, I reprove and chasten: be zealous therefore, and repent.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.20'>Behold, I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and will open the door, I will enter unto him, and will sup with him, and he with me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.21'>And to him who overcometh I will give to sit with me upon my throne, as also I have overcome, and have sat with my Father in his throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.3.22'>He who hath ears, let him hear what the Spirit saith to the churches.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.4'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.1'>AFTER these I saw, and, behold, a door (was) open in heaven. And the first voice that I had heard as a trumpet talking with me, said, Come up hither, and I will make thee see the (things) which must be after these.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.2'>At once I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne placed in heaven, and upon the throne (One) sat.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.3'>And he who sat was like to the appearance of the stone of jaspon, and of sardion; and the bow of the clouds was around the throne, in resemblance to the appearance of zmragda.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.4'>Around the throne were seats twenty and four; and upon those seats twenty and four presbyters sitting, who were robed in white vestments, and upon their heads wore coronets of gold.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.5'>And from the throne went forth lightnings and the voice of thunders. And there were seven lamps of fire which burned before His throne, which are the seven Spirits of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.6'>And before the throne was a sea of brightness like chrystalos; and in the midst of the throne, and around it, and before the throne, four living-ones, who were full of eyes before and behind.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.7'>And the first living-one was like the lion, and the second living-one was like the calf, and the third living-one had a face as a man, and the fourth living-one was like the eagle which flieth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.8'>And these four living-ones, each of them, had six wings round about; and within were full of eyes; and they rest not day and night from saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who wast, and art, and art to come.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.9'>And when those living-ones give glory and honour and thanks unto Him who sitteth upon the throne, to Him who liveth for ever and ever,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.10'>the four and twenty presbyters fell before Him who sitteth upon the throne, and worshipped Him who liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.4.11'>Worthy art thou, O Lord, And our God the Holy One, To receive glory and honour and power; For thou hast created all, And by thy hand they are, And through thy will they were and are created.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.5'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.1'>AND I saw in the right hand of him who sat on the throne a writing which was written within and on the back, and sealed with seven seals.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.2'>And I saw a mighty angel who proclaimed with a great voice: Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.3'>And no one was able, in heaven above, nor upon earth, nor under the earth, to open the book, or to inspect it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.4'>And I wept much, because no one could be found who was worthy to open the book, or to inspect it.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.5'>And one of the presbyters said to me, Weep not; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Jihuda, who is the root of David, hath prevailed. He will open the book and the seven seal thereof.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.6'>And I saw, in the midst of the presbyters, a Lamb standing, as slain, who had seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven Spirits of Aloha, which are sent forth to all the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.7'>And he came and took the book from the right hand of him who sat upon the throne.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.8'>And when he had taken the book, the four living-ones and the twenty and four presbyters fell down before the Lamb, having each of them an harp, and vials of gold full of perfumes, which are the prayers of the saints.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.9'>And they hymned a new hymn, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, And to open the seals thereof; Because thou wast slain, And hast redeemed us to Aloha by thy blood, From every tribe and tongue and people and nation.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.10'>And thou hast made them to our God kings and priests, And reigning upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.11'>And I saw and heard as the voice of many angels around the throne, and the living-ones, and the presbyters, and the number of them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of thousands,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.12'>which said with a great voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain, To receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, And honour, and glory, and blessing,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.13'>And every creature which is in heaven, and on earth, And under the earth, and in the sea, And all them which are therein. And I heard him who sat upon the throne saying: To the Lamb let there be given blessing, and honour, and glory, and praise, and dominion, for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.5.14'>And the four living-ones said, Amen! And the presbyters fell, and worshipped.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.6'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.1'>AND I saw, when the Lamb had opened one of the SEVEN SEALS. And I heard one of the four living-ones speaking as the voice of thunder, Come, and see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.2'>And I looked: and there was a white horse; and he who sat upon him had a bow, and there was given to him a crown; and he went forth conquering, so that he might conquer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.3'>And when he had opened the SECOND SEAL, I heard the second living-one, who said, Come!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.4'>And there went out another horse (which was) red; and to him who sat upon him was given to take peace from the earth, and thus that one another they should kill; and there was given to him a great sword.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.5'>And when he had opened the THIRD SEAL, I heard the third living one, saying, Come, and see! And I saw, and, behold, a black horse, and he who sat upon him had a balance in his hand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.6'>And I heard a voice from the midst of the four living-ones, saying, A choenix of wheat for a dinar; And three choenices of barley for a dinar; And the oil and the wine hurt not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.7'>And when he had opened the FOURTH SEAL, I heard the fourth living-one, saying, Come, and see!</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.8'>And I saw a green horse, and he who sat upon him had the name of Death, and Shiul followed after him. And there was given to him power over the fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword, and with famine, and with death, and with the toothed beast of the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.9'>And when he had opened the FIFTH SEAL, I saw under the altar the souls of them who had been killed for the word of Aloha, and for the testimony of the Lamb, which had been theirs.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.10'>And they cried with a great voice, saying, Until when, O Lord, holy (and) true, Dost thou not judge and avenge our blood On those who dwell upon the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.11'>And there was given to each of them the white robe; and it was told them, that they should rest yet a little time, until should be completed their fellow-servants, their brethren who would be killed as also they.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.12'>And I saw when he opened the SIXTH SEAL, there was a great movement; and the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and all the moon became as blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.13'>and the stars of heaven fell to the earth, as the fig-tree casteth her figs, when from a great wind she is shaken.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.14'>And the heavens were sundered as a book that is rolled, and all the mountains and islands from their places were moved;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.15'>and the kings of the earth and great ones, and the chiefs of thousands, and the rich and the mighty ones, and every servant, and every freeman, hid them in the caverns, and in the rocks of the mountains,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.16'>saying to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall upon us, and hide us from the face of him who sitteth upon the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.6.17'>For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to stand?</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Rev.7'>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.1'>AND after these, I saw four angels standing upon the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth, that the winds should not blow upon the earth, nor upon the sea, nor upon the trees.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.2'>And I saw another angel, and he ascended from the rising of the sun; who had the seal of Aloha the Living. And he cried with a great voice to the four angels to whom it had been given to hurt the earth and the sea,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.3'>saying, Hurt not the earth, nor the sea, neither the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God upon their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.4'>And I heard the number of them who were sealed, an hundred and forty and four thousands, sealed of every tribe of Israel:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.7.5'>of the tribe of Jihuda, twelve thousand were sealed; of the tribe of Rubill, twelve thousand; of the tribe of Gad, twelve thousand;</verse>

        <verse osisID='Rev.22.1'>AND he showed me a river of waters of life, clear as crystal, coming forth from the throne of Aloha and of the Lamb.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.2'>In the midst of the wide street of it, and by the river, here and there, (was) the tree of life, which produced twelve fruits, in every month giving each one its fruit. And the leaves of the tree (are) for the healing of the nations.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.3'>And there shall be no more falling away; and the throne of Aloha and of the Lamb shall be in it, and his servants shall serve him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.4'>And they shall see his face, and his name shall be upon their foreheads.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.5'>And night shall be no more: nor any need have they of the light of a lamp, or the light of the sun; for the Lord God enlighteneth them, and they will reign for ever and ever.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.6'>And he said to me, These sayings are faithfulness and truth. And the Lord God of the spirit of the prophets hath sent me, his angel, to show to his servants the things which must soon be done.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.7'>And behold, I come quickly. Blessed is he who keepeth the words of the prophecy of this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.8'>And also I Juhanon am he who heard and saw these. And when I had heard and seen, I fell to worship before the feet of the angel who showed them to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.9'>And he said to me, See (that thou do it) not. I am thy fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them who keep the words of this book. Worship Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.10'>And he said to me, Seal not the words of the prophecy of this book; for the time draweth nigh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.11'>He who doeth evil shall work evil still; and he who is filthy shall be filthy still; and the righteous shall still do righteousness, and the holy be holy still.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.12'>Behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to render to every one according as is his work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.13'>I am Olaph and Thau, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.14'>Blessed are they who do his commandments, that they may have authority to the tree of life, and by the gates may enter into the city.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.15'>Without are dogs, and sorcerers, and fornicators, and murderers, and servers of idols, and every one who loveth and maketh a lie.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.16'>I JESHU have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things before the churches. I am the root and the offspring of Dawid, as the bright, the morning star.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.17'>AND THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE SAY, COME! AND HE WHO HEARETH SHALL SAY, COME! AND HE WHO THIRSTETH MAY COME, AND HE WHO WILLETH, TO TAKE THE WATERS OF LIFE FREELY.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.18'>I testify to every one who heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, That if any man shall set upon them, Aloha will set upon him the plagues which are written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.19'>And if any man make to cease from the words of the book of this prophecy, Aloha will make to cease his portion of the tree of life, and of the holy city of which is written in this book.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.20'>He who testifieth these saith, Yes: I come quickly. Amen. Come, Lord Jeshu.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Rev.22.21'>The grace of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha be with all the saints. Amen.</verse>
