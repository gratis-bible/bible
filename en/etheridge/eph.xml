        <verse osisID='Eph.1.1'>PAULOS, an apostle of Jeshu Meshiha by the will of Aloha, to those who are in Ephesos, saints and believers in Jeshu Meshiha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.2'>peace be with you, and grace from Aloha our Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.3'>Blessed be He, Aloha, the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, who hath blessed us with all blessings of the Spirit in heaven, in the Meshiha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.4'>as he before elected us in him, from before the foundations of the world, that we should be saints, and without blemish before him,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.5'>and in love predesignated us unto himself, and constituted us children in Jeshu Meshiha, according to the pleasure of his will;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.6'>that the glory of his grace might be glorified, that (grace) which he hath poured upon us by the hand of his Beloved:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.7'>in whom we have redemption, and by his blood the remission of sins, according to the riches of his grace</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.8'>which he hath made to abound in us in all wisdom and in all understanding of the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.9'>and hath made known to us the mystery of his will, which before he had determined in himself should be done:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.10'>that in the dispensation of the fulness of the times, every thing from the first might be renovated in the Meshiha, in heaven and in earth. And by him</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.11'>we have been chosen, even as he predesignated and willed, who worketh all according to the mind of his will;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.12'>that we who first hoped in the Meshiha, should be to the honour of his glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.13'>In whom you also heard the word of truth, which is the gospel of your salvation; and in whom you believed and were sealed with the Spirit of Holiness who was promised;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.14'>who is the earnest of our inheritance, until the redemption of those who are saved, and unto the praise of his majesty.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.15'>ON account of this, behold, I also, since I heard of your faith in our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, and your love to all the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.16'>have not ceased to give thanks on your behalf, and to remember you in my prayers;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.17'>that the God of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, the Father of glory, would give to you the Spirit of wisdom and of revelation in his knowledge,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.18'>and would enlighten the eyes of your hearts to know what is the hope of his calling, and what the riches of the glory of his inheritance for the saints,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.19'>and what is the inheritance of his power in us who believe, according to the operation of the might of his power,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.20'>which he wrought in the Meshiha, and raised him from among the dead, and set him at his right hand in heaven, above all the principalities,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.21'>and powers, and mighty ones, and rulers, and above every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in (that) to come;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.22'>and subjected every thing beneath his feet: and Him who is over all he hath given to be the head of the church,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.1.23'>which is His body, the completeness of Him who all in all completeth.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.2'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.1'>You also who were dead in your sins and in your transgressions,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.2'>in which from the first you walked according to the worldliness of this age, and according to the will of the prince of the power of the air, of that Spirit who urgeth in the sons of disobedience;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.3'>in those works in which we also walked from the first in the lusts of our flesh, doing the will of our flesh and of our mind, and were the sons of wrath fully as the rest.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.4'>BUT Aloha, who is rich in his mercies, for his great love wherewith he loved us</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.5'>while we were dead in our sins, made us alive with the Meshiha, and through his grace delivered us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.6'>and raised us with him, and made us to sit with him in heaven in Jeshu the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.7'>that he might show to the ages to come the greatness of the riches of his grace and his goodness, which hath been upon us in Jeshu the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.8'>For by his grace are we saved through faith, and this was not of you, but is the gift of Aloha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.9'>not of works, that no man should glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.10'>For we are his creation, who are created in Jeshu Meshiha unto good works, which Aloha hath prepared before, that in them we should walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.11'>Wherefore be mindful, that you Gentiles at first were carnal, and were called the Uncircumcision by that which is called the Circumcision, and is the work of the hands in the flesh;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.12'>and were at that time without the Meshiha, and were aliens from the polity of Israel, and strangers to the covenant of the promise, and, without hope, were without Aloha in the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.13'>But now, by Jeshu the Meshiha, you who before were far off, are brought nigh by the blood of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.14'>For he is our peace, he who hath made the two one, and hath destroyed the wall which stood in the midst,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.15'>and the enmity, through his flesh; and the law of prescriptions, with its requirements, he hath abolished, that of the two he might create in himself one new man, and make peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.16'>and hath reconciled the two in one body with Aloha, and by his cross hath slain the enmity.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.17'>And coming, he preached peace to you, to the far off, and to the nigh; therefore,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.18'>through Him there hath been made for us both an access by one Spirit unto the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.19'>THEREFORE are you no more strangers and sojourners but sons of the city of the saints, and sons of the house of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.20'>and you are builded upon the foundation of the apostles and of the prophets, and Jeshu the Meshiha himself is the chief corner of the building;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.21'>and in him is the whole building increased and enlargeth into a holy temple in the Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.2.22'>while you also in him are being builded the dwelling of Aloha by the Spirit.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.3'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.1'>On account of this I, Paulos, am bound for Jeshu Meshiha for the sake of you Gentiles:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.2'>if you have heard the dispensation of the grace of Aloha which was given me for you;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.3'>that by revelation he made known to me the mystery, as I have written to you in few (words);</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.4'>so that while you read you are able to understand my knowledge of the mystery of the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.5'>which in other generations was not known to the sons of men, as it hath now been revealed to his holy apostles and to his prophets by the Spirit;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.6'>that the Gentiles should be sons of his inheritance and partakers of his body, and in the promise which is given concerning him by the gospel,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.7'>of which I am made a minister, according to the gift of the grace of Aloha, which he hath given me by the operation of his power.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.8'>To me, who am the least of all the saints, is given this grace, that I should preach among the Gentiles the riches of the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.9'>which are not searched; and to bring to light unto all men what is the dispensation of the mystery which was hidden from the ages in Aloha, who created all:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.10'>that through the church might be made known the wisdom of Aloha, which is full of diversities, to the principalities and powers who are in heaven,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.11'>that which he prepared from of old, and which he hath executed by Jeshu our Lord,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.12'>by whom we have freedom and access with the confidence of the faith of him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.13'>WHEREFORE I pray that I may not weary in my affliction, which is on your account,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.14'>for this is your glory; and I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.15'>from whom is named the whole family who are in heaven and in earth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.16'>that he would give to you, according to the riches of his glory, with power to be confirmed by his Spirit in your interior man;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.17'>that the Meshiha may dwell by faith in your hearts in love; your root and your foundations being confirmed,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.18'>that you may be able to follow out with all the saints, what the height, and depth, and the length, and breadth;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.19'>and know the grandeur of the love of the Meshiha, and be filled with all the fulness of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.20'>But to Him who is able with power beyond all to do for us above what we ask or conceive, according to his power which worketh in us,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.3.21'>to Him be glory in his church, by Jeshu Meshiha, in all ages, for ever and ever. Amen.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.4'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.1'>I BESEECH of you, therefore, I, the bound one for our Lord, that you walk as is worthy of the calling wherewith you are called,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.2'>in all lowliness of mind, and composedness, and long-suffering; and be patient towards one another in love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.3'>And be diligent to keep the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.4'>that you may be in one body and in one Spirit, even as you are called in one hope of your calling.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.5'>For one is the Lord, and one the faith, and one the baptism;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.6'>and one is Aloha, the Father of all, and over all, and by all, and in us all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.7'>But unto each of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.8'>Wherefore it is said, He ascended on high; He led captive captivity, And gave gifts unto men.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.9'>But he who ascended, what is it but that he also descended first into the low places of the earth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.10'>He who descended, is he who also ascended above all the heavens, to fulfil all.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.11'>And he gave some who (are) apostles, and some who (are) prophets, and some who (are) evangelists, and some who (are) pastors, and some who (are) doctors;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.12'>for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edification of the (church of the) Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.13'>until we be all one in the faith and in the knowledge of the Son of Aloha, and one man perfect in the measure of the stature of his completeness;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.14'>and that we be no children, agitated and altered by every wind of fraudulent doctrines of men, which in their craftiness they fabricate deceptively in order to seduce,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.15'>but be confirmed in our love, that whatever is ours may increase in the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.16'>who is the head, by whom the whole body is increased and compacted in all the limbs, according to the gift which is given in proportion to every member for the increase of the body itself, that in love its structure might be completed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.17'>BUT this I say and testify in the Lord, that from henceforth you may not walk as the rest of the Gentiles, who walk in the vanity of their minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.18'>and are darkened in their understandings, and are alienated from the life of Aloha on account of their ignorance, and on account of the blindness of their hearts;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.19'>who are cut off from their hope, and have delivered themselves up to lasciviousness and to the working of all uncleanness in their greediness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.20'>But you have not thus learned the Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.21'>if really you have heard him and learned as the truth is in Jeshu;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.22'>but that you put from you your former habitudes, the old man who is corrupt in deceitful lusts,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.23'>and be renewed in the spirit of your minds,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.24'>and wear the new man, who by Aloha is created in righteousness and in the sanctity of truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.25'>WHEREFORE let lying cease from you, and speak the truth every man with his neighbour: for we are members one of another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.26'>Be angry and sin not, and let not the sun set upon your wrath,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.27'>and give no place to the accuser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.28'>And let him who hath stolen henceforth steal not, but labour with his hands and do good, that he may have to give to him who needeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.29'>Let no hateful word come out of your mouth, but that which is comely and useful for edification, that it may communicate grace to those who hear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.30'>And grieve not the Holy Spirit of Aloha, by whom you have been sealed unto the day of redemption.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.31'>Let all bitterness, and heat, and anger, and clamour, and scandal be taken from you, with all malice;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.4.32'>and be gentle one with another, and affectionate, and forgive one another, even as Aloha in the Meshiha hath forgiven us.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.5'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.1'>Be therefore imitators of Aloha, as beloved children;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.2'>and walk in love, as the Meshiha also loved us, and delivered himself for us, an offering and a sacrifice to Aloha of a fragrant smell.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.3'>BUT fornication and all uncleanness and covetousness, let them not be even heard among you, as it becometh the saints;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.4'>neither filthiness, nor words of folly, or of jeering, or fables, which are not necessary, but, instead of these, thanksgiving.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.5'>But this know, that any man who is a fornicator, or impure, or covetous, or an idolater, hath no inheritance in the kingdom of the Meshiha and of Aloha;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.6'>lest any man deceive you with vain words; for because of these cometh the anger of Aloha upon the sons of disobedience.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.7'>Be not, therefore, participators with them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.8'>For you were before darkness, but now you are light in our Lord. As the sons of light, then, so walk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.9'>For the fruits of the light are in all goodness and rectitude and truth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.10'>And be discerning of that which is good before our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.11'>And have no communion with the works of darkness, which have no fruits, but reprove them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.12'>For that which in secrecy they do it is execrable even to mention.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.13'>For every thing is exposed by the light, and is revealed, and whatever revealeth is light.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.14'>Wherefore it is said, Awake thou who sleepest, And arise from the dead, And the Meshiha shall enlighten thee.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.15'>See then that you walk vigilantly, not as fools,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.16'>but as the wise who redeem their opportunity, because the days are evil.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.17'>On account of this, be not wanting in mind, but understand what is the will of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.18'>And be not drunk with wine, in which is intemperance, but be filled with the Spirit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.19'>And discourse with yourselves with psalms and with hymns and with songs of the Spirit, singing with your hearts unto the Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.20'>And give thanks always on behalf of every man in the name of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha unto Aloha the Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.21'>And be subject one to another in the love of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.22'>WIVES, be subject to your husbands as to our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.23'>For the husband is the head of the wife, as the Meshiha is the head of the church, and he himself is the Saviour of the body.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.24'>But as the church is subject to Meshiha, so also (should) wives be unto their husbands in every thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.25'>Husbands, love your wives, as also the Meshiha loved his church, and gave himself for her,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.26'>that he might sanctify her and purify her in the laver of waters and by the word,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.27'>and that he might constitute her a church unto himself, being glorified, and not having blemish or wrinkle or any thing like these; but to be holy and spotless.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.28'>So it becometh husbands to love their wives, as their own bodies. For he who his wife loveth, himself he loveth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.29'>For no man ever hated his own body, but nourisheth it, and taketh care of it; so also the Meshiha (taketh care) of the church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.30'>For we are members of his body, and of his flesh are we, and of his bones.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.31'>Because of this a man leaveth his father and his mother, and cleaveth unto his wife, and they two become one flesh.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.32'>This mystery is great; but I speak of the Meshiha and of his church.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.5.33'>Nevertheless let every one of you so love his wife as his own self; but let the wife reverence her husband.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Eph.6'>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.1'>Children, obey your parents in our Lord, for this is right; and this is the first commandment which promiseth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.2'>Honour thy father and thy mother,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.3'>that it may be well with thee, and thy life be prolonged upon the earth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.4'>Parents, make not your children angry, but make them to grow in the discipline and in the doctrine of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.5'>Servants, be subject to your masters who are according to the flesh, with fear and trembling, and with simplicity of heart, as unto the Meshiha:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.6'>not in the sight of the eyes, as if you were pleasing men (only), but as the servants of Meshiha who do the will of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.7'>And serve them from all your soul, in love, as unto our Lord, and not as unto men;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.8'>knowing that whatever good a man doeth he is rewarded by our Lord, whether he be a servant or a son of freedom.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.9'>So you, masters, do likewise to your servants; forgiving them a fault; for you know also that your Master is in heaven, and there is no respect of persons with him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.10'>HENCEFORTH, my brethren, be strong in our Lord, and in the power of his strength.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.11'>And clothe you in all the armour of Aloha, that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the accuser.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.12'>For your wrestling is not with flesh and blood (only), but with princes, and with powers, and with the possessors of this dark world, and with the evil spirits who are under heaven.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.13'>Wherefore clothe you with all the armour of Aloha, that you may be able to meet the evil one, and being prepared in every thing you may stand.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.14'>Stand, therefore, with your loins strengthened with the truth, and wear the breastplate of righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.15'>and let your feet be shod with the preparation of the gospel of peace;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.16'>and with these take to you the shield of faith, that therewith you may be empowered with strength to extinguish all the burning shafts of that evil one;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Eph.6.17'>and put on the helmet of salvation, and take the sword of the Spirit which is the word of Aloha.</verse>
