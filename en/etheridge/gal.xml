  <div type='book' osisID='Gal'>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.1'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.1'>Paulos, an apostle, not from men, nor by men, but by Jeshu the Meshiha, and Aloha his Father, who raised him from among the dead,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.2'>and all the brethren who are with me, to the churches which are in Galatia:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.3'>Grace be with you and peace, from Aloha the Father, and from our Lord Jeshu Meshiha,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.4'>who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from this evil world, according to the will of Aloha our Father:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.5'>to whom be glory to the age of ages. Amen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.6'>I am amazed how soon you have been turned from the Meshiha himself, who called you by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.7'>unto another gospel, which it is not; but there are men who disturb you, and (who) wish to remove you from the gospel of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.8'>But if we also, or an angel from heaven, should preach to you other than what we have preached to you, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.9'>As I have said before, and now again say to you, If any man preach to you other than what you have received, let him be accursed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.10'>For now do I persuade men, or Aloha? or do I seek to please men? For if until now I had pleased men, I should not have been the servant of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.11'>But I make known to you, my brethren, that the gospel which is preached by me was not from man:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.12'>for neither from man had I received it and taught it, but by the revelation of Jeshu the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.13'>For you have heard of my former manners in Judaism, that I exceedingly persecuted the church of Aloha, and made it desolate.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.14'>And I excelled in Judaism more than many of the sons of my years who were of my kindred, and was exceedingly zealous for the doctrine of my fathers.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.15'>But, when He willed who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me by his grace,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.16'>to reveal his Son in me, that I should preach among the nations, immediately I did not disclose to flesh and to blood;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.17'>neither went I to Urishlem, to the apostles who were before me, but I went into Arabia, and again returned unto Darmsuk.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.18'>And after three years I went unto Urishlem, that I might see Kipha, and I remained with him days fifteen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.19'>But others of the apostles I saw not, only Jakub, the brother of our Lord.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.20'>But these which I write to you, behold, before Aloha, that I lie not.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.21'>And after these I went to the regions of Syria and of Cilicia.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.22'>Neither did the churches of Jihud which are in the Meshiha know me by face.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.23'>But this only they had heard, that he who had formerly persecuted us, behold, now preacheth he that faith which he beforetime had overthrown.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.1.24'>And in me they glorified Aloha.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.2'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.1'>Again, from fourteen years I went up to Urishlem with Bar Naba, and took with me Titos.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.2'>But I went up by revelation; and I disclosed to them the gospel which I proclaim among the nations; and I showed it to those who were considered to be somewhat between myself and them, lest in vain I had run or should run.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.3'>Titos also who was with me, who was an Aramoya, was not constrained to be circumcised.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.4'>But on account of false brethren, who entered upon us that they might espy the liberty which we have in Jeshu Meshiha as that they might bring me into subjection;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.5'>yet not for the space of an hour did we cast ourselves down to be subject to them; that the truth of the gospel might continue with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.6'>But, they who were considered to be somewhat,---but what they were I care not, for Aloha accepteth not men?s faces,---they themselves added nothing unto me;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.7'>but otherwise: for seeing that I was intrusted with the gospel of the uncircumcision, as Kipha was intrusted with the circumcision;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.8'>---for he who wrought effectually with Kipha for the apostleship of the circumcision, wrought effectually also with me for the apostleship of the Gentiles;</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.9'>---and knowing the grace which had been given to me, Jakub and Kipha and Juchanon, who were considered to be pillars, the right hand of fellowship gave to me and to Bar Naba, that we (should preach) among the Gentiles, and they among the circumcision:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.10'>only (requiring) that of the poor we should be mindful; and I have been solicitous to do this same thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.11'>But when Kipha had come to Antiokia, I rebuked him to his face, because they were offended by him.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.12'>For until certain men came from Jakub, he had eaten with the Gentiles; but when they were come, he withdrew himself and separated, because he was afraid of those who were of the circumcision.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.13'>And the rest of the Jihudoyee also were thrown with him in this, so that Bar Naba also was led away by their partiality.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.14'>And when I saw that they were not walking rightly in the truth of the gospel, I said to Kipha in the presence of them all: If thou who art a Jihudoya live as an Aramoya and not Judaically, why forcest thou the Gentiles to live Judaically?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.15'>If we who by our nature are Jihudoyee, and are not of the Gentile sinners,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.16'>because we know that man is not justified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeshu Meshiha, also in him, in Jeshu Meshiha, have believed, that from the faith of the Meshiha we may be justified, and not from the works of the law; because from the works of the law shall no flesh be justified:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.17'>---If, while we seek to be justified through the Meshiha, we also ourselves are found sinners, is Jeshu Meshiha therefore the minister of sin? It cannot be.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.18'>For, if those things which I destroyed I build again, I make it manifest of myself that I transgress the commandment.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.19'>For I by the law to the law am dead, that unto Aloha I may live:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.20'>and with the Meshiha am I crucified, and from henceforth I live not, but in me liveth Meshiha; and this that I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of Aloha, who loved me and gave himself for me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.2.21'>I do not deny the grace of Aloha; for if righteousness is by the law, the Meshiha died in vain!</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.3'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.1'>O deficient-minded Galatoyee, who bewildereth you? For, behold, as if depicted before your eyes, hath Jeshu the Meshiha been crucified.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.2'>This only would I know from you: Through the works of the law received you the Spirit, or through the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.3'>Are you so foolish that having begun in the Spirit you are now finishing in the flesh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.4'>And all these have you borne in vain? But would it be in vain?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.5'>Then, he who imparted to you the Spirit, and wrought miracles among you, (did he so) through the works of the law, or through the hearing of faith?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.6'>As Abraham believed Aloha, and it was reckoned to him for righteousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.7'>know therefore that they who are of faith are the children of Abraham.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.8'>For Aloha who knew before that he would justify the Gentiles through faith, evangelized before unto Abraham; as saith the holy scripture: In thee all the nations shall be blessed:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.9'>therefore believers are blessed with Abraham the believer.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.10'>For they who are of the works of the law are under the curse: for it is written, Cursed is every one who doeth not all that is written in this law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.11'>But that man is not justified by the law before Aloha, this maketh manifest: because it is written, The just by faith shall live.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.12'>But the law is not of faith: but he who doeth those things that are written in it shall live by them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.13'>But us hath the Meshiha bought from the curse of the law, and hath been made a curse instead of us: for it is written, Accursed is every one who is hanged on the wood:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.14'>in order that upon the nations there might be the blessing of Abraham in Jeshu the Meshiha, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.15'>My brethren, I speak as among men: That a covenant of man because confirmed no one rejecteth, or changeth in any thing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.16'>But to Abraham was promised the promise, and to his seed. And he did not say to him, Unto thy seeds, as of many; but, To thy seed, as of one, him, (namely,) who is the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.17'>But I say this, that the covenant which was confirmed before by Aloha, in the Meshiha, the law which was after, four hundred and thirty years, cannot nullify, nor (can it) abolish the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.18'>But if the inheritance was by the law, it could not have been by the promise; but Aloha gave it unto Abraham by promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.19'>Wherefore then was the law? It was added on account of transgression, until the Seed should come, he, of whom was the promise; and the law was given by angels into the hand of a Mediator.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.20'>But a Mediator is not of one; but Aloha is one.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.21'>Is the law therefore against the promise of Aloha? Impossible: for if a law had been given which could make to live, certainly righteousness would have been by the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.22'>But the scripture hath included all under sin, that the promise through faith of Jeshu Meshiha might be given to them who believe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.23'>But until (the dispensation of) faith came, the law kept us, as shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.24'>The law therefore was our conductor to the Meshiha, that we might be justified by faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.25'>But faith being come, we are not under the conductor.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.26'>For you are all the children of Aloha through the faith of Jeshu the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.27'>For they who into the Meshiha are baptized have been clothed with the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.28'>Jihudoya or Aramoya is not; the slave or the free is not; male or female is not; for you are all one in Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.3.29'>And if you are of the Meshiha, therefore are you the seed of Abraham, and heirs by the promise.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.4'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.1'>But I say that what time the heir is a child, he differeth not from a servant, though he be lord of all,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.2'>but is under curators and stewards until the time which his father appointeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.3'>So we also, while children, under the principles of the world were subjected.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.4'>But when the fulness of the time had come, Aloha sent his Son, and made from a woman, and made under the law,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.5'>that them who were under the law he might redeem, and we might receive the constitution of sons.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.6'>And because you are sons, Aloha hath sent the Spirit of his Son into your hearts, who crieth, Father, our Father.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.7'>Therefore you are not servants, but sons; and if sons, heirs also of Aloha, through Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.8'>For, while not knowing Aloha, you served them who by their nature are not gods:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.9'>but now that you have known Aloha, and especially that you have been acknowledged of Aloha, turn you again to those diseased and beggarly principles, and will to be subject to them afresh?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.10'>Days, and months, and times, you observe.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.11'>I am afraid, lest vain in I have laboured among you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.12'>Be you as I am, for I am as you are, my brethren, I beseech you. In nothing have you injured me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.13'>For you know that in infirmity of my flesh I preached to you at the first.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.14'>And the temptation of my flesh you did not despise nor execrate; but as an angel of Aloha you received me, and as of Jeshu Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.15'>Where then is your happiness? For I testify of you, that had it been possible, your eye you would have plucked out and given to me.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.16'>Have I become your adversary, because I have preached to you the truth?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.17'>They are emulous of you not for good; but they would shut you in, that you might be emulous of them.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.18'>But it is well to be emulous in good things at all time, and not only when I am with you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.19'>My children, with whom I travail afresh until the Meshiha be formed in you,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.20'>I would be with you now, and change the sound of my voice, because I am astonished at you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.21'>Tell me, you who are willing to be under the law, do you not hear the law?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.22'>For it is written, that Abraham had two sons, one of the bondmaid, and one of the free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.23'>But he who was of the bondmaid was born according to the flesh, and he who was of the free was by the promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.24'>But these are parables of the two covenants: the one which was from Mount Sinai bringing forth into bondage, which is Hagar:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.25'>for Hagar is Mount Sinai which is in Arabia, and answers to this Urishlem, and serves in bondage, she and her children.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.26'>But she, Urishilem the high, is the free, who is our mother.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.27'>For it is written, Be glad, O barren, who hast not borne; Exult and cry, thou who hast not travailed; Because multiplied are the sons of the desolate, More than the sons of the married wife.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.28'>But we, my brethren, as Ishak, are the children of promise.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.29'>And as then he who was born of the flesh persecuted him who was after the Spirit, so also now.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.30'>But what saith the scripture? Cast out the bondmaid and her son; for the son of the bondmaid shall not inherit with the son of the free.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.4.31'>We therefore, my brethren, are not the children of the bondmaid, but the children of the free.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.5'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.1'>Stand therefore in that liberty with which the Meshiha hath freed you, and be not enthralled with the yoke of bondage.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.2'>Behold, I, Paulos, tell you, that if you be circumcised, the Meshiha profiteth you nothing.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.3'>But I attest again to every man who is circumcised, that he is obligated to fulfil the whole law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.4'>You have ceased from the Meshiha who are justified by the law, and from grace you have fallen.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.5'>But we through the Spirit, who is from faith, expect the hope of righteousness.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.6'>For, in the Meshiha Jeshu, circumcision is not any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which is made perfect by love.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.7'>Well did you run; who hath impeded you, that to the truth you should not be in obedience?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.8'>Your persuasion is not from him who called you.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.9'>A little leaven the whole mass leaveneth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.10'>I am confident of you in our Lord, that no other thing you will think; and he who disturbeth you shall bear judgment, whoever he is.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.11'>But I, my brethren, if yet I have preached for circumcision, why have I been persecuted? Hath the scandal of the cross ceased?</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.12'>But I would that they who disturb you were even cut off.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.13'>But you have been called unto liberty, my brethren: only let not your liberty be for an occasion of the flesh; but in love be subjected one to another.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.14'>For all the law in one word is fulfilled, in this: Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.15'>But if you bite and devour one another, beware lest one by another you be consumed.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.16'>But I say to you, Walk in the Spirit, and the desires of the flesh you will not work.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.17'>For the flesh desireth that which is repugnant to the Spirit, and the Spirit desireth that which is repugnant to the flesh; and the two are adverse one to the other, that not any thing that you will you may do.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.18'>But if by the Spirit you are led, you are not under the law.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.19'>For the works of the flesh are known, which are (these), fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.20'>the worship of idols, sorcery, enmity, contention, ambition, wrath, calumny, divisions, rendings,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.21'>envy, murder, drunkenness, revelling, and all that are like these; and they who do them, as I told you before, so now I tell you, the kingdom of Aloha do not inherit.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.22'>But the fruits of the Spirit are, love, joy, peace, prolonging of the spirit, benignity, goodness, fidelity,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.23'>meekness, patience; against these the law is not set.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.24'>But they who are of the Meshiha have crucified their flesh, with all its passions and its lusts:</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.25'>live we therefore in the Spirit,</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.5.26'>and let us not be vain-glorious, contemning one another, envying one another.</verse>
      </chapter>
      <chapter osisID='Gal.6'>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.1'>My brethren, if a man of you be overtaken by a fault, you who are in the Spirit, regain him, in the spirit of meekness, and beware lest you also be tempted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.2'>And bear the burden of one another, and so fulfil the law of the Meshiha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.3'>For if a man consider that he is something, while he is not, he deceiveth himself.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.4'>But let every man prove his work, and then in himself he shall exult, and not in others.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.5'>For every man shall bear his own burden.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.6'>But let him who heareth the word, communicate to him from whom he heareth it, in all good things.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.7'>Do not err. Aloha is not mocked: for whatever a man soweth, that he reapeth.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.8'>He who in the flesh soweth, from the flesh corruption reapeth; and he who in the Spirit soweth, from the Spirit the life that is eternal shall reap.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.9'>And while we do that which is good, let it not weary us; for the time will be when we shall reap, and it will not weary us.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.10'>Now, therefore, while the time is ours, let us do good unto every man, and especially to the sons of the house of the faith.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.11'>You see these letters which I have written to you with my hands.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.12'>They who would glory in the flesh would constrain you to be circumcised; only lest for the cross of the Meshiha they might be persecuted.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.13'>For neither do these who are circumcised keep the law; but they will that you be circumcised, that in your flesh they may glory.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.14'>But to me let it not be that I shall glory except in the cross of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha, by which the world is crucified unto me, and I am crucified to the world.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.15'>For circumcision is not any thing, nor uncircumcision, but the new creature.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.16'>And they who this pathway accomplish, peace be upon them and mercy, and upon the Israel of Aloha.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.17'>Henceforth upon me let no man throw a burden; for the signatures of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha in my body I bear.</verse>
        <verse osisID='Gal.6.18'>The grace of our Lord Jeshu Meshiha be with your spirit, my brethren. Amen.</verse>
